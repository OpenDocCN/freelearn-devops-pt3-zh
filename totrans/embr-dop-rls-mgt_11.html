<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">There is a widespread misunderstanding regarding the right approach to DevOps release management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">The truth is that one solution may be effective for one particular customer, but it may not be optimal for another. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">Every solution must align with an organization’s unique culture, working style, and software release objectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">If you look at enough DevOps-centric establishments, you’ll notice that they encounter several common pitfalls over the course of their operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.5">Most of them end up wasting a lot of time and money learning the hard way as they iteratively tweak their DevOps strategy through extensive trial and error. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.6">Even though this is often an inevitable aspect of the DevOps journey, let’s investigate some of the ways that you can hedge against these growing pains, leading your organization to become the next </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">success story.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">A change management strategy</span><a id="_idIndexMarker748"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1"> is a deliberate approach that empowers leaders to effectively navigate a company through change while reducing disturbance and the potential for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">unforeseen outcomes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Although the objective may involve altering the organization, the crucial factor for achieving success, in the majority of instances, is the aptitude to effectively guide individuals throughout the process of change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Businesses typically pursue change when their existing business plan no longer contributes to the organization’s success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">An innovative approach is necessary to enhance profit margins and maintain competitiveness amid a dynamic corporate environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">Depending on the organization’s long-term objectives, every change project will have a unique character. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.5">Efficiency, performance, and the development of superior procedures may be the focal points of your change program. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.6">Innovation can be incremental, such as adding new features to an existing product, or revolutionary, such as developing a whole new line </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">of products.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Your employees and company processes will probably experience some level of disruption as a result of the change, no matter how small or large it is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Unexpected repercussions might arise from even the most well-intentioned and essential of reforms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">The necessity for a methodical strategy grows in tandem with the size and complexity of the change, as does the associated risk. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">Consequently, it is essential to have a methodical approach to change and to guide your staff </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">through it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Not having a carefully designed</span><a id="_idIndexMarker749"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1"> approach to managing change is a common mistake. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">No release management program would be complete without a change advisory board or change control board of some kind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">They are primarily responsible for assisting the company in conducting objective risk and impact assessments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">When used in conjunction with one another, they aid in the discovery of technical dependencies that could otherwise go undetected during deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.5">Establishing consistent procedures for handling project change requests and tracking their approval and implementation will greatly aid in the development of your change management process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.6">It is advised that your organization implement standardized </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">change proposals</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1"> and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">change </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">management logs</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">A </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">change proposal</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1"> delineates the nature and magnitude</span><a id="_idIndexMarker750"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> of the proposed change, serving as an initial stage in the change management procedure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">When initiating a change proposal, provide a comprehensive analysis of the rationale behind the change, anticipated results and effects, necessary time and resources, and any additional factors that necessitate evaluation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">Your organization’s change proposal document should provide additional room for incorporating descriptive details, along with dedicated sections for computing expenses and for documenting the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">expected benefits.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">A </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">change management log</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1"> is a written record that monitors</span><a id="_idIndexMarker751"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1"> the individuals who initiated a particular modification, the date and time of the request, the current state of the change request, its level of importance, and details regarding its resolution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">To obtain a more comprehensive record, incorporate additional specifics such as the nature and consequences of the modification. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">Additional reasons to keep a detailed change management log are to facilitate the organization and retrieval of critical data, enabling efficient prioritization, resolution, and future references of previous </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">change requests.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Effectively managing change involves more than simply creating and conveying a persuasive vision. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">It encompasses more than just possessing a clearly defined change model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">The failure of organizational change is often attributed to a lack of comprehension by senior executives and change leaders regarding the psychology of their employees and the culture of their organization, rather than the change </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">process itself.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Presented next are four alarming factors that contribute to the failure of change management initiatives, along with data-driven recommendations for resolving </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">these issues.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Employees must comprehend the rationale for change management initiatives</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Before embarking on any organizational </span><a id="_idIndexMarker752"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">change, it is essential to thoroughly examine the underlying reasons that necessitate such a transformation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Answering this question should be straightforward; you just need to explain the reasons behind the organization’s transition and the necessity for personnel to participate in the transformation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">It may seem quite surprising that many workers are unclear about the motives behind the shift in management initiatives introduced by their leaders </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">and employers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">On average, 1 in 6 employees in any organization understands the rationale behind their organization’s strategy at any given moment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Said another way, according to this statistic, 85% of employees working for a given company are not clear why changes are taking place, what the significance of that change means, or what the significance of their own participation means in context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">To say that this is shocking would be an understatement, but if you were to perform an identical survey at your own organization, chances are that your results would follow similar conclusions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">Notably, the subjects of these change initiatives span a wide range of verticals, such as economics, marketplace, competitive factors, and others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.5">The bottom line is this: often, there are more people who never or rarely understand the objective behind their organization’s strategy than there are those who always or frequently do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.6">Let’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">change that!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Without comprehending the underlying</span><a id="_idIndexMarker753"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> reasoning behind organizational change management, individuals will not be inclined to modify their behavior. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">If a company appears to be thriving on the surface, it would seem very illogical to the majority of reasonable people why any kind of change would be required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">The worst part, though, is that most executives don’t launch new change initiatives at random. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.4">Organizational change management is something that most leaders have given a lot of thought to, perhaps </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">for months.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Executives may have been keeping tabs on market movements, tracking the development of cutting-edge tech, or taking notice of major developments at industry conferences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">For months, most executives have pondered the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">why</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> behind a change management initiative, regardless of the details. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">However, when announcing new change initiatives, many executives often neglect to communicate the cognitive process they underwent that led them to their realization and recognition of the necessity for change within </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">the organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">While leaders may jot down some notes or deliver a short presentation outlining their thoughts, it’s rare for those documents to reflect the months of deliberation, inquisition, and competitive research that really went into them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">So, the result is that the present change management activities are not well understood by the average employee. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">In all candor, most change management processes put far too much emphasis on outlining a desired future state of the change endeavor and far too little on the rationale behind the change management process that is needed to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">achieve it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">The success of every organizational change program hinges on your ability to articulate the reasoning behind it, down to the most minuscule details, in a clear and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">concise manner.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Executives operate outside of their comfort zone, while others...</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">How are executive officers unique</span><a id="_idIndexMarker754"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1"> from regular people? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Most people would say it’s due to a lack of balance between their job and their personal life; perhaps it is that they are more ambitious, are more intelligent, or have good fortune. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">The truth is that in the majority of cases, it is none of these. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">Rather, it is a combination</span><a id="_idIndexMarker755"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> of risk tolerance with change readiness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Essentially, the typical </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">chief executive officer</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">CEO</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">) is an enthusiastic agent of change, and it is this courageousness that defines </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">their character.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Those familiar with human nature won’t be surprised that less than one-third of individuals take on challenging or bold changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">Generally speaking, people tend to avoid change, or they make small changes that yield a small impact. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">A total of 45% of C-suite executives make what others would call bold or visionary changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.4">Contrarily, just 27% of frontline workers fall into that category. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.5">That is to say, when compared to frontline workers, CEOs are 66% more likely to desire a bold </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">change initiative.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">There is a clear and robust correlation between an individual’s hierarchical position within the firm and their propensity to engage in bold and daring initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">Employees and managers who work directly with customers are more likely to favor maintaining the status quo, and even if they do accept change, they will be more cautious about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">When it comes to spearheading transformation, executives are frequently daredevils, driven by uncertainty, big dreams, and drastic action. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.4">Ambitious people do best in dynamic settings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.5">In general, they thrive on taking on large tasks and relish the opportunity to pioneer novel approaches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.6">That makes them much more enthusiastic about change management than the average employee in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">their organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">This idea is crucial for every change management approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Those at the top of an organization are more likely to back a change effort or program if they are the ones who instigated it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">However, it is important to note that the CEO or change manager may lack an understanding of the fact that their perspective differs significantly from that of the vast majority of people working directly with customers and other frontline workers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.4">In short, senior executives are significantly more likely to be interested in taking on the role of change manager, while those working on the front lines are much more inclined to be content with how </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">things are.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Leaders aren’t candid about the difficulties they face</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">A notable aspect of change</span><a id="_idIndexMarker756"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> management is that it is comparatively simpler to implement change in a company that is experiencing failure, as opposed to one that is already successful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">The reason for this is simple: doing </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">business as usual</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1"> is not an option for a struggling corporation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Why would an organization continue to operate with the same approach when that company is clearly failing? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">Perhaps, ironically, change leaders like to engage with dysfunctional businesses that have a strong sense </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">of urgency.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">However, in prosperous organizations, it is reasonable for employees to inquire about the rationale behind implementing organizational change when they are already achieving success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">For the uninitiated, it might seem reasonable to question why an organization would require a change management plan even when they are experiencing significant success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">Undoubtedly, even the most prosperous corporations encounter obstacles; no company is flawless. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.4">The problems begin when leaders become averse to engaging in open and honest discussions regarding difficulties they are facing and how those obstacles are affecting </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">the business.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Just 35% of CEOs consistently or regularly communicate the challenges that they are experiencing, and this correlation only goes higher the more severe an issue becomes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">This indicates that approximately 66% of leaders are neglecting to engage in the crucial practice of openly communicating their challenges as part of the change management process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">Leaders who choose an evolutionary approach to change management are less inclined to publicly communicate difficulties compared to leaders who embrace a more revolutionary approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.4">Their inclination toward gradual modifications diminishes their propensity toward extensive deliberations regarding </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">company obstacles.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">On the other hand, there are leaders who proceed under the erroneous belief that if they discuss the difficulties that the organization is experiencing, then they would be perceived as being pessimistic or negative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Nevertheless, that is completely false. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">The act of openly discussing difficulties is not a negative thing; rather, it is only being honest and frank. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">There is a significant amount of admiration among workers for leaders who exhibit that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">particular quality.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">A successful change initiative necessitates a compelling impetus; no organization undergoes transformation without a strong justification. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">If the corporation is actively seeking to achieve transformational change, then the requirement for a compelling challenge becomes even more significant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">An effective change management model emphasizes that organizational change will progress more rapidly and smoothly when there is a significant problem that must be addressed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">However, if your suggested change lacks a direct connection to a specific, pressing, and tangible problem, you should anticipate encountering</span><a id="_idIndexMarker757"/> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">significant opposition.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">Employee temperaments are resistant to change</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Organizational culture, including employee personalities, is a rarely discussed predictor of successful </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">organizational change.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">In the realm of workplace dynamics, individuals are galvanized to action by a set of five prominent motivators: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Achievement</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Power</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Affiliation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Security</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">, and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Adventure</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">These five motivators play a pivotal role in shaping and influencing human behavior within professional settings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.3">It has been determined that a significant proportion of workers, specifically 33%, exhibit a strong inclination toward being motivated by affiliation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.4">Furthermore, an additional 20% of participants have demonstrated a notable inclination toward being motivated </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">by security.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">Individuals motivated by affiliation seek positive relationships and acceptance from others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">These people prefer jobs with substantial personal interaction, are group-oriented, and excel in teamwork. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">The problem arises when an organization implements sudden changes that make people uncomfortable, leading to the dissolution of affiliative bonds, the departure of key team members, and a sense of a previously close-knit group falling apart. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.4">If affiliative individuals were included in a change advisory board, they may be more likely to transition from resistors to key stakeholders. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.5">However, individuals motivated by security seek stability and reliability in their employment, tasks, and compensation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.6">They value guarantees and tend to stay with the same company, position, or department for a long time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.7">High-security individuals frequently experience anxiety when faced with change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.8">They are not inclined toward transformational, highly destructive, or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">disruptive change.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">In certain instances, it is important to note that not all companies possess a substantial workforce consisting primarily of individuals motivated by security and affiliation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">Instead, there are cases where organizations are comprised of individuals who are driven by a desire for adventure and are catalysts for change within the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">For companies that place a strong emphasis on social cultures and prioritize consistency and predictability, the process of transformational change can be particularly disruptive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.4">The situation can present significant challenges if the primary stakeholders of the organization are primarily motivated by concerns related to security </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">and affiliation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">You may be wondering how you can determine whether or not your culture employs a majority of people who are driven by affiliation and security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Take a look at the things that appear to motivate your staff members. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">If they place a high value on working together as a team, maintaining social relationships with coworkers, and spending a lot of time in person, there is a good chance that they have a strong affiliation drive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.4">There is a good chance that they have a high security drive if they tend to think things through before acting on them, experience anxiety when confronted with ambiguity, and favor jobs and projects that are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">well defined.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Now that we have covered the reasons</span><a id="_idIndexMarker758"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1"> why it is important to have a carefully designed change management process, let’s expand on this theme. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">In the next section, we will discuss the importance of following a software release checklist. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">Combining these two strategies ensures that you stay organized and can adequately communicate the value that your team brings to the organization as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">a whole.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">A common challenge in release</span><a id="_idIndexMarker759"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1"> management is adhering to a release checklist, which is a frequently neglected necessity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">The information contained in a release checklist is critical; a few examples include: ensuring that all components have been accurately labeled for release, a clear rollback plan has been established, and the user documentation has been freshly revised. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">However, a reference to a comprehensive release checklist has been included in the </span><a href="B21803_Appendix.xhtml#_idTextAnchor223"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Appendix</span></em></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1"> of the book, for your benefit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">As a release manger, even if you are experiencing a less productive day or facing distractions while creating a product, the checklist remains a reliable source of truth that will help you stay focused and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">on track.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">To ensure the best possible </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">user experience</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">UX</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">), it is essential that you incorporate</span><a id="_idIndexMarker760"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1"> relevant questions into every release checklist. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">By doing so, you can guarantee that each release delivers exceptional value to the end user’s experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.3">A fantastic way to make certain that your software product is ready for release is by ensuring that your release checklist contains both </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">pre-</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1"> and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">post-</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">release activities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">This should include final reviews, testing, and release package creation for the former, and tasks for updating documentation, informing end users, and monitoring application performance for the latter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">In the context of DevOps, a software release checklist expedites the process of delivering a product by guaranteeing that every release undergoes thorough testing to verify its optimal viability through a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">reliable pipeline.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">When embarking on the release of a new software application, it becomes evident that there are a multitude of factors that necessitate careful consideration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">The most important thing to remember is that these questions and the standards by which you should evaluate each release are completely subjective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">In order to effectively navigate through diverse environments, it is highly important to construct a comprehensive set of queries. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.4">These questions will serve as a valuable tool in acquiring the necessary information and insights pertaining to each distinct environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.5">A successful release can be achieved by following customized checklists that meet the needs of each unique product or business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.6">By strictly adhering to the checklist, software releases can be completed swiftly and without the risk of expensive mistakes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">or delays.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">However, it is important to note that any comprehensive list of ultimate criteria must include all aspects of a release, with particular emphasis on performance, security, and usability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">Never forget that it’s better to be thorough than to be careless. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">Prior to shipping your software, ensure that it complies with the industry standards, as outlined in your checklist. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.4">When you have finished the entire project, you do not want to come to the realization that you neglected to ask one of these questions during the process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.5">Your users will be very grateful that you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">did so.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Finally, to guarantee a smooth</span><a id="_idIndexMarker761"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1"> release cycle, it is necessary to determine whether the support team is cognizant of any features that could cause confusion for the end user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">An adept support team is vital for the implementation of any product, and software is no different. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.3">The frequency and severity of challenges encountered by customers can be greatly reduced if the support personnel receives thorough training and possesses a comprehensive understanding of the application’s functionality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.4">Generic responses seldom satisfy customers, so plan on delivering personalized support for each one in all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">available opportunities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">Make sure they have access to as much pertinent information as you can in order to set them up for success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">This will not only ensure that the release cycle is successful, but it will also prevent engineers and product managers from having to deal with questions that are recurring in the future. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">A great way to do this is to derive your support materials from the release checklist itself; this ensures that your support documentation is as comprehensive as the release process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.4">By doing so, you can optimize the process and guarantee that development teams and customers obtain the information they need with minimal effort. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.5">To make this</span><a id="_idIndexMarker762"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1"> process better, it is helpful if you define key elements of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">software release.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Successful releases go far beyond following a checklist</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">A software release checklist can be defined</span><a id="_idIndexMarker763"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1"> as a meticulously organized compilation of items and tasks that are adhered to by development and operations teams in order to guarantee the glorious release of a software product. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">The checklist functions</span><a id="_idIndexMarker764"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1"> as an exhaustive manual, encompassing diverse facets of the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">software development life cycle</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">SDLC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">In essence, it serves as a surrogate for a navigational guide, aiding teams in maneuvering through the intricacies of deploying software using a regulated and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">effective method.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">However, there is one rather significant caveat about what a software release checklist is and what it should and should not be used for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">A checklist is fundamentally just a way to organize the actions that you should already be taking anyway! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.3">To be clear, a release checklist should follow the work that you are performing, not leading it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.4">The crucial point to understand is that you must avoid becoming an organization that focuses on checking boxes rather than innovating and optimizing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.5">Otherwise, your operations will become dull, stagnant, unimaginative, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">and uncompetitive.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">To avoid becoming a tick-the-box organization, your software release checklist must be the product of a group effort that includes</span><a id="_idIndexMarker765"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1"> an extensive array of individuals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">Software engineers, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">quality assurance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">QA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">) specialists, system administrators, and project managers are all essential members of the team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">To ensure that your release checklist is comprehensive and useful, every team member must contribute their own distinct input and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">unique perspective.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">Next is a list of nine crucial activities that your software development team should already be doing on an ongoing basis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">Notably, it is important that these items are reflected in your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">release checklist.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">Code review and QA</span></h3>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">DevOps release management</span><a id="_idIndexMarker802"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1"> is a game-changing approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.2">It is becoming increasingly common for businesses across virtually all sectors to implement DevOps in order to provide teams with the time and autonomy they require to handle more ambitious tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.3">Using a DevOps release management strategy can invigorate your engineering team and direct your product development efforts toward better satisfying your customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.4">On the other hand, any time that you adopt a new technique, there is always the possibility of encountering </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">significant challenges.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">Problems and obstacles are inevitable whenever you try to alter the fundamental nature of your business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">Every transition to DevOps comes with its own set of challenges that your team will have to overcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.3">With regard to transformations, it is impossible to anticipate and mitigate every potential challenge that may arise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.4">However, this particular chapter aims to equip you with the necessary knowledge needed to navigate the most frequently encountered pitfalls in DevOps release management and provide you with effective strategies for their resolution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.5">When considering the implementation of DevOps practices, it remains essential to have the necessary awareness of the elements involved and the intuition required to effectively prioritize them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.6">As with any implementation of DevOps release</span><a id="_idIndexMarker803"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1"> management, an organization must maintain its primary focus on people first, followed by process, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">finally, technology.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Most executives have experienced</span><a id="_idIndexMarker804"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1"> unsuccessfully leading</span><a id="_idIndexMarker805"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1"> an organization through a change initiative that ran counter to the organization’s culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">Although this might sound surprising the truth is that more than two-thirds of all organizational change </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">initiatives fail.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">The failure rate is significantly greater when efforts are designed to disrupt the entire existing business culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">It should not come as a surprise to see that four-fifths of these attempts are met with defeat. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.3">When it comes to organizations, culture is deeply ingrained and endures through generations of personnel that come and go over the course of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.4">Altering the culture of an organization is not the first step in a campaign to change the organization; rather, it is the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">last step.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">Leaders engaging in a DevOps</span><a id="_idIndexMarker806"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1"> transformation must have a thorough understanding of the methodology’s unique dynamic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.2">Implementing DevOps in organizations is a complex process that involves more than just adopting new technical practices and tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.3">As Gene Kim explains in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">The Phoenix Project</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">, organizations that embrace </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">The Three Ways</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1"> principles invite significant advantages that make achieving success more likely. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">We covered in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">Chapter 5</span></em></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1"> that this involves a transition from a culture of isolated departments to a mindset that emphasizes efficiency and adaptability, with a primary focus on continuously creating and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">delivering value.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">History has shown us that culture change has been a significant obstacle in the adoption of DevOps release management practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.2">It has emerged as the primary culprit that hinders the adoption of DevOps among the many organizations that embark on such a transfiguration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.3">The breadth of research pertaining to the challenges associated with cultural transformation leads to a definitive observation: the adoption of a DevOps methodology inherently carries a significant degree of risk and is susceptible to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">potential setbacks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">One possible solution is to maintain the status quo and steer clear of the challenging journey toward cultural transformation that frequently accompanies the implementation of a DevOps initiative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.2">The issue associated with the aforementioned strategy lies in the fact that DevOps encompasses a broader scope beyond existing merely as a methodology or framework that is solely applicable to technologists. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.3">In contemporary society, organizations encounter a continuous flow of internal and external influences that have the potential to shape their culture in big ways. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.4">These influences encompass a wide range of factors, including market disruption caused by new competitors, fluctuations in global economics, geopolitical instability, currency fluctuations, shifts in workforce demographics, and rapid advancements in technology, among others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.5">These forces present organizations with both favorable prospects and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">potential challenges.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">The capacity to swiftly adapt and innovate within this particular context has emerged as a fundamental organizational asset. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.2">The adoption of DevOps, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">when implemented successfully</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">, brings about an abundance of prosperity in systems development processes, technology, and culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.2">These changes are crucial in fostering organizational agility, which in turn allows businesses to attain a competitive edge in today’s dynamic markets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.3">The aforementioned factors result in a decrease in the time required to bring a product or service to the market, a reduction in wasteful activity, an enhancement in overall quality, and the introduction of novel and revolutionary products </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">and services.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">The inherent difficulty faced by leaders and agents of change when initiating DevOps initiatives is discovering a means to overcome these obstacles and strategically enhance the likelihood of success</span><a id="_idIndexMarker807"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1"> as you adopt DevOps principles, methods, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">and culture.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">Your initial goal should be to gain insight into factors that contribute to the significant failure rates observed in most organizational change initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">Numerous studies identify multiple variables that contribute to suboptimal outcomes in a variety of scenarios. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">These variables include inadequate planning, institutional resistance to change, ineffective communication, and impractical expectations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.4">The prevailing considerations are predominantly associated with the manner in which members of a company respond to change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.5">The three highest-ranked items, listed in sequential order, are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">presented here:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">Resistance to change</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">: This refers to the natural tendency</span><a id="_idIndexMarker808"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1"> of individuals or groups to oppose or be hesitant toward adopting new ideas, technologies, or processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">This resistance can manifest in various ways, such as skepticism, fear, or a desire to maintain the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">status quo.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">Low readiness for change</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">: This refers to a state in which</span><a id="_idIndexMarker809"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1"> individuals or organizations are resistant or unprepared to embrace and adapt to new ideas, processes, or technologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.2">This lack of readiness can hinder progress and innovation, as it creates barriers to implementing necessary changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.3">It may stem from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">various factors.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">Poor employee engagement</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">: This refers to a situation where</span><a id="_idIndexMarker810"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1"> employees are not fully involved, motivated, or committed to their work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.2">This lack of engagement can have negative consequences for both the employees and the organization as a whole. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.3">It may result in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">decreased productivity.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">Equipped with this new understanding, it is important to set out on a quest to explore strategies for enhancing the ability of individuals within an organization to effectively adapt to and embrace change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">Numerous everyday observations indicate that the manner in which leaders exercise their leadership and interact with others holds considerable sway over the degree to which employees respond amiably to change, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">or not.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">For the better part of four decades, literature on the topic of successful leadership behavior has been centered on the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">Theory of Transformational Leadership</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">, pioneered by James McGregor Burns. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.2">More academic publications have been published on this subject than on any other alternative theory of leadership in history. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.3">According to Burns and other scholars such as James Victor Downton, successful transformational leaders possess the four main traits </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">listed next:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">For company executives in charge of present and future DevOps transformations, additional research shows two crucial conclusions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">First, the adoption of particular change management strategies is less effective than inspiring followers to actively support organizational change as a whole. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.3">Furthermore, and maybe most importantly, transformative leadership consists of practices that can be taught to and learned </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">by others.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">Leadership is the secret ingredient</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">Organizations can enhance</span><a id="_idIndexMarker816"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1"> the likelihood of success for DevOps and other change initiatives by implementing training, coaching, and mentoring programs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.2">These programs aim to develop the transformational leadership competency of current and future leaders within the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.3">By investing in these initiatives, organizations can take tangible and proven measures to increase the probability of success in their endeavors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.4">DevOps leaders who achieve success demonstrate notable qualities in vision, authenticity, and dedication to personal development and creativity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.5">They empower their teams and encourage </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">decentralized decision-making.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">This has obvious implications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">The manner in which leaders exercise their leadership skills plays a crucial role in successfully managing the challenging process of cultural transformation associated with the adoption of DevOps practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.3">The leadership style chosen by an organization has a direct impact on how its members react to significant changes in processes, technology, roles, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">and ideologies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">The likelihood of a successful DevOps transformation significantly increases when practitioners are actively involved, motivated, empowered, and supported within a conducive environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.2">This environment is characterized by leaders who provide a clear vision, lead with honesty and authenticity, and cultivate a culture </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">of trust.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">Thinking DevOps is mainly about tools</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">The implementation of DevOps</span><a id="_idIndexMarker817"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1"> release management is heavily dependent on the utilization of various tools, which serve the purpose of expediting task completion and fostering enhanced collaboration among different groups involved in the software development and operations processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">The selection of appropriate tools holds significant importance in this regard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.3">As we have covered extensively in this book, the DevOps methodology encompasses a wide spectrum of tools, including source </span><a id="_idIndexMarker818"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">code and version control management tools, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">continuous integration/continuous deployment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">CI/CD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">) tools, communication and collaboration platforms, and monitoring tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">Notably, these tools are already numerous and continually growing as each </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">day passes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">On the contrary, dedicating excessive amounts of time and focus toward selecting the optimal tool (which, it should be noted, does not actually exist), and subsequently providing training to teams for its utilization, becomes a futile endeavor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">This is especially true if said tool fails to accurately replicate your desired workflow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.3">The hypothetical tool in our example here has the potential to accomplish the task it was selected for through the pursuit of clever strategies and occasional manual implementation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.4">However, this approach may result in a more arduous and exasperating UX (for both internal and external parties) than necessary, often resulting in limited utilization of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">the tool.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">DevOps, at its core, revolves around the elimination of obstacles and the optimization of the process for delivering value to customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.2">In the arena of problem-solving, the significance lies not in the individual tools employed, but rather in the identification and alleviation of pain points. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.3">Even more significant than any of this are the minds of the individuals and the creative talent employed to use these tools and to solve these challenges. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.4">It would behoove any executive to know where their bread </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">is buttered.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">Let us explicate the fundamental distinctions between CI/CD and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">DevOps further.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">The scope of DevOps versus CI/CD</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">CI is a fundamental principle</span><a id="_idIndexMarker827"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1"> in software engineering that promotes the regular integration of team members’ work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.2">In the context of software development, practitioners of this methodology strive to incorporate changes into the code base on a frequent basis, typically on a daily or even an hourly basis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.3">In the traditional context, integration was an expensive ordeal that necessitated extensive communication between various engineering groups. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.4">In order to overcome this obstacle, CI promotes the use of testing and building automation tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.5">The development of a software-defined life cycle is the end aim of this kind of automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.6">By reducing the amount of work required for integration, successful CI helps teams find and fix integration </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">errors faster.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">Similar to how CI optimizes the processes of building and testing software, CD enhances the effectiveness of packaging and deploying software applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.2">Organizations that embrace CD can effectively orchestrate the entire SDLC, encompassing design, construction, packaging, and deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.3">This approach facilitates the realization of software-defined production, an approach that aims to optimize cost-efficiency and automation to the fullest </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">extent possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">At its best, CI/CD allows</span><a id="_idIndexMarker828"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1"> for the rapid deployment of updated software to production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.2">This promotes a culture of DevOps, whereby the SDLC gives users more chances to share feedback and more opportunities to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">be imaginative.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">The purpose of DevOps and CI/CD</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">CI/CD consolidates all code updates</span><a id="_idIndexMarker829"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1"> of an application</span><a id="_idIndexMarker830"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1"> into a unified repository, followed by automated testing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.2">This process guarantees the comprehensive development of the product and meticulously readies it for deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.3">The primary objective of CI/CD is to facilitate rapid, streamlined, and automated deployment of product updates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.4">This process additionally reduces product defects, thereby enhancing average user satisfaction levels. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.5">In essence, a robust CI/CD pipeline enhances the speed and quality of software development, provides benefits to operational and product development teams, and increases the overall business value for the enterprise and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">its customers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">DevOps release management is a methodology that aims to resolve a common challenge faced by many organizations: a lack of coordination and collaboration between the operations, development, and other teams throughout the process of creating new software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.2">Due to insufficient collaboration, a communication gap and lack of cooperation will usually result in significant obstacles and costly setbacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.3">By bringing together the various elements found throughout the SDLC, DevOps release management aims to streamline these efforts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.4">DevOps accomplishes this by promoting a software development process that is more nimble, simplified, and productive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.5">By fostering and sustaining a shared culture among teams, DevOps readily facilitates the adoption of common business processes and the overall improvement of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">collaboration levels.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">The individual benefits of DevOps and CI/CD</span></h4>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.849.1">When transitioning from a monolithic</span><a id="_idIndexMarker890"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.1"> architecture to microservices, it is important to take into account the considerations </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.851.1">that follow:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.852.1">Thorough plan creation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.1">: First and foremost in guaranteeing a smooth transition from monolithic to microservices architecture is a well-defined migration roadmap. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.2">Pay close attention to this initial step because it’s simple to miss important details and make mistakes if you don’t. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.3">You, the development team, and the business owners will all benefit from complete transparency during the migration process if you have a detailed plan that accounts for fair division of resources, minimization of risks, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.854.1">workload sharing.</span></span><p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.855.1">Also, make preparations for unexpected events and possible obstacles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.855.2">Plan for a fallback to the old design and what to do if problems emerge during </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.856.1">the move.</span></span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.857.1">Freezing new feature development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.858.1">: Upgrades and patches to systems that are still in operation during migrations are a leading cause of project failure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.858.2">The team will have twice as much work to accomplish if the company is always requesting system changes, new features, or updates to existing ones during the transition to a microservices-based architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.858.3">Prior to migrating to microservices, businesses must provide resources to execute these enhancements within the monolith. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.858.4">Because of this, the monolithic architecture becomes more complicated, which in turn makes the migration take longer and causes technical debt </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.859.1">to accumulate.</span></span><p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.860.1">Consequently, the team runs the risk of squandering time and energy, leading to an enormous backlog of unfinished work and a microservices architecture that doesn’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.861.1">function properly.</span></span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.1">Current system assessment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.863.1">: Perform a thorough evaluation of your current monolithic</span><a id="_idIndexMarker891"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.864.1"> system in order to identify areas that necessitate enhancement or contain obsolete features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.864.2">The migration process presents a valuable opportunity to leverage contemporary technologies and methodologies in order to revamp inefficient and outdated processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.864.3">Microservices architecture allows for the incorporation of relatively new features with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.865.1">minimal modifications.</span></span><p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.1">In addition to refactoring pre-determined functionality, developers may encounter additional code vulnerabilities while performing the migration process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.2">The possibility of additional modifications and a prolonged timeline for development may arise as a result </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.867.1">of this.</span></span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.868.1">Choosing an experienced migration team</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.869.1">: Although an optimal theoretical microservices migration plan exists, it is often challenging to implement it completely in real-world scenarios due to the uniqueness of each project, necessitating a customized solution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.869.2">In order to determine the most suitable option, it is vital to have a highly skilled </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.870.1">migration team.</span></span><p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.1">Achieving a successful migration entails more than simply completing a technical project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.2">Undoubtedly, it will predominantly assume a technical nature, necessitating a methodical and cautious progression. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.3">However, the most crucial aspect is to carefully select the appropriate team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.4">You require individuals possessing the appropriate mindsets and technical intuition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.5">The remainder of the process relies on the application of specific methodologies and the proficiency of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.872.1">the developers.</span></span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.1">Allocating sufficient time for the transition</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.874.1">: Take into account the amount of time required for the shift from a monolithic architecture to microservices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.874.2">This is not a simple process, but rather an exploration into uncharted territory that might be time-consuming. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.874.3">The minimal timeline for the project varies depending on its complexity and requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.874.4">The duration could range from 1 year to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.875.1">several years.</span></span><p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.1">To alleviate any anxieties regarding these timelines, it is important to note that your monolithic application will remain functional throughout the transfer process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.2">Although it is advisable to halt expansion and the addition of new features, your solution will continue to function until the whole transition to microservices</span><a id="_idIndexMarker892"/> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.877.1">is achieved.</span></span></p></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.893.1">The unfortunate reality is that the project team will sometimes choose to cut off all communication with the client. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.893.2">Most often, this happens after a disagreement or after changes in requirements have occurred and emotions run hot. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.893.3">The client may also perceive that they benefit from this since they would prefer to not deal with any more conflicts or difficult situations; after all, they want the project to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.894.1">get completed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.895.1">This level of naivety may seem effective until there is a need for some type of interaction between the project and the client. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.895.2">Reestablishing that connection and beginning the conversation all over again is never easy, but it’s essential for the project’s success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.895.3">Perhaps, the newly reestablished relationship falls by the wayside, and the vicious cycle of conflict and divergent viewpoints begins all over again. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.895.4">This kind of toxic relationship certainly won’t benefit anyone or the project </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.896.1">in general.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.897.1">If you intentionally avoid communicating with customers because you mistakenly believe that they hinder your progress and that providing updates or engaging in conversations with them will distract you from completing project work, I’m here to tell you that this is foolish! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.897.2">It is absolutely essential that you receive prompt feedback from the customer as often as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.897.3">Doing so ensures that your team receives vital information that is necessary</span><a id="_idIndexMarker896"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.898.1"> to improve a product and produce optimal outcomes for all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.899.1">parties involved.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.900.1">Several factors can contribute to customers exhibiting less communication </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.901.1">than anticipated:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.902.1">Customers are happy with what’s happening</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.903.1">: Assuming that they are pleased with the progress of the project, they may learn through various channels how the project is moving in comparison to the plan and will be content with it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.903.2">Although it is entirely feasible, it would be prudent to call and discuss it just to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.904.1">be sure.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.905.1">Customers have higher-priority work that needs their attention</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.906.1">: In certain instances, individuals may be engaged in multiple competing priorities such as other projects that they perceive as more intriguing or compelling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.906.2">As a release or project manager, it is your responsibility to recognize where your project’s position lies within the customer’s hierarchy of priorities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.906.3">To obtain accurate information regarding this, it is essential to establish consistent communication with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.907.1">your customers.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.908.1">Customers don’t know what their project management responsibilities are</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.909.1">: At times, clients, particularly those in bigger companies, lack knowledge about how projects operate and may believe that they can continue with their other obligations once they have initiated the project and can wait for its successful completion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.909.2">As a release/project manager, it is your duty to keep your clients abreast of project status if they lack understanding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.909.3">The day may come when you really need their help, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.910.1">after all.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.911.1">Customers have lost interest in your project</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.1">: In the pursuit of completing a project, it is common for individuals to dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to what they are trying to accomplish. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.2">Your customers are likely occupied with their respective jobs and will not be available sometimes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.3">When engaging with others, it is important to exercise caution and thoughtfulness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.4">The primary purpose of providing updates is to inform stakeholders about the current status and any challenges that have emerged during the course of a project or task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.5">In order to ensure future support for the project, it is important to establish their backing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.6">In the context of customer engagement, it is crucial to address situations where customers become unresponsive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.7">This lack of communication may indicate a potential loss of interest in the project, which could be indicative of broader organizational issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.8">Therefore, it is essential to actively engage with these customers to ascertain their level of interest and identify any </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.913.1">underlying concerns.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.914.1">A project should not have</span><a id="_idIndexMarker897"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.915.1"> the goal of cultivating a group of clients who are not particularly vocal about their needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.915.2">If some clients are more reserved than others or have become less communicative than they have been in the past, then this is an indication that something needs to be investigated more deeply. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.915.3">Always keep in mind that the customers of a project are its allies and champions, and it is the responsibility of individuals working on the project to maintain engagement with those customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.915.4">While it is true that this does take time away from what some people might consider to be direct project work, it is ultimately beneficial to make sure that you have a group of clients that are both supportive and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.916.1">thoroughly involved.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">These dangers serve as examples of the CI/CD processes’ complexity and the many potential attack surfaces that they present. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">The fundamentals of a DevOps governance model involve the identification and mapping of potential risk areas, followed by the implementation of a set of policies, standards, and procedures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">These measures are put in place to ensure adherence to established processes and to uphold the desired level of code quality and system integrity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">Moreover, this endeavor will have a significant influence on the overall operations of the business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.5">By implementing improved governance practices, not only will the level of security risks be diminished, but the efficiency of your pipeline will be enhanced, enabling developers to maintain their workflow and effectively meet your business requirements in a more expeditious and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">cost-effective way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">It is necessary to implement comprehensive evaluations and manual authorizations for any modifications and adaptations made inside the environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Automated code review is essential for the efficient and effective evaluation of code quality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">However, despite the benefits of automation, it is still necessary to conduct manual code reviews for any new customizations or modifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">This</span><a id="_idIndexMarker902"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> requirement is prevalent in the majority of </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Source Control Management</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">SCM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">) platforms, such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">as GitHub.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">It is also best practice to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker904"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1"> adhere to the segregation of duties, a practice that makes it much harder for someone to perpetrate fraud or deliberately damage your systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">It also reduces the risk of errors since more than one person oversees essential tasks, such as reviewing pull requests and merging new code in with the mainline branch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">Also consider requiring multi-factor authentication, which requires that users must show at least two different kinds of identification to prove who they are. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.4">Usually, they need to know something metaphysical, such as a password, but also possess a physical thing, such as a security key or a one-time code sent to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">their phone.</span></span></p>
