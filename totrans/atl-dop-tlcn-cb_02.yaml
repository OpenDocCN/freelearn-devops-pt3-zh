    trigger for a value stream, an important construct for DevOps thinking. This trigger
    is typically an idea or new thought that can be expressed as a new product or
    feature. **Jira Product Discovery** (**JPD**), a product in the Atlassian Jira
    family, allows users to create and track work items called **ideas** to record
    the ideation process. After a decision has been made to proceed into implementation,
    it can proceed into development as an **epic** in Jira.
