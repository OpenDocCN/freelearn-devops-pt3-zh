<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Here are some of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1304"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">the core responsibilities that filled most of our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">working time:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">System installation and configuration</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">: As an AIX administrator, one of your main responsibilities was to install and configure the AIX operating system on IBM server hardware. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Ensuring the smooth and efficient operation of these systems </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">was critical.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">As part of a company transitioning to DevOps, you participate in several meetings throughout the day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">These include stand-ups with your immediate team to discuss daily objectives and blockers, as well as larger meetings with other teams to facilitate better communication and collaboration, a core tenet </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">of DevOps.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">After </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1308"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">addressing immediate support tasks, you focus on software development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">Here, you encounter the clash between the old and new, writing code in short sprints as per Agile practices, but waiting for it to be deployed in the waterfall stages of testing, staging, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">and production.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">Documentation is a crucial part of your role. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">Keeping track of support issues, coding decisions, and discussions not only provides a reference but also helps in creating a knowledge base for the entire team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.3">This helps push toward the DevOps mentality of shared responsibility </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">and knowledge.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">Given that DevOps is still relatively new, you dedicate time each day to self-learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">Whether exploring new tools such as Jenkins for CI, or Docker, which was just beginning to make waves in 2012, you stay on the cutting edge, pushing for more efficient practices in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">your organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">At the end of the day, you review your work, update ticket statuses, and prepare for the next day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">As someone straddling support and development roles, you continuously balance between customer support and pushing the envelope on the software </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">development process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">Working in this environment is challenging, sometimes frustrating, but also exciting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">You are at the forefront of change, helping to transition the company from a rigid waterfall model to a more flexible and collaborative </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">DevOps culture.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">DevSecOps embeds security practices into the CI/CD pipeline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">It includes automating security checks and vulnerability scans, enforcing policy as code, and continually monitoring for potential security risks in data systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.3">This practice makes security an integral part of software development and operations, enabling early and proactive detection of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">security issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">The present DevOps and SRE landscape is characterized by the profound integration of databases, analytics, AI, and ML systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.2">This integration reshapes established practices and workflows, bringing greater automation, reliability, speed, and security to the development and operation of data-intensive applications and systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.3">It’s a new frontier of DevOps and SRE, where data, AI, and ML are at the heart of operations, creating not only technological challenges but also opportunities for innovation </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">and growth.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-405"><a id="_idTextAnchor404"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Summary</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">I consider myself lucky, having been able to experience first-hand such an amazing change in the world of Data and DevOps in such a short period of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.2">The last 14-15 years were nothing but extraordinary, filled with ambiguity, opportunity, and pure passion </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">for innovation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">In 2009, the term “DevOps” was only just emerging, and its principles were far from widespread adoption. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">Traditional software development was marked by silos, where developers and operations teams worked separately. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.3">This disjointed approach often led to significant bottlenecks in the software delivery process, causing delays </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">and conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">Data systems at this time were largely monolithic and on-premises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">Relational databases were the norm, and NoSQL databases were just beginning to gain traction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.3">The management of these systems was largely manual, and they were often treated as separate entities from the applications </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">they supported.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">CI/CD practices were not as widely accepted or practiced as they are today. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">Jenkins, one of the pioneers in this area, was just starting to gain popularity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.3">IaC was also a relatively new concept, with tools such as Chef and Puppet starting </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">to emerge.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">Monitoring and observability were more reactive than proactive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">Tools such as Nagios were used to monitor system health, but the scope of these tools was limited, and they often lacked the ability to provide in-depth insights into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">system performance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">Security in development and operations was often an afterthought, dealt with at the end of the development cycle, or, worse, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">after deployment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">Fast forward to 2023, and the DevOps landscape has significantly evolved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">DevOps is now the standard approach in software development, promoting a culture of collaboration between developers and operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.3">CI/CD is a widely practiced strategy, with numerous sophisticated </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">tools available.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">Data systems have become more complex and varied. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">There’s a move toward distributed systems, with technologies such as microservices, serverless architectures, and containers becoming more popular. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.3">NoSQL databases have matured, and new types of databases such as time-series, graph, and in-memory databases have entered the scene. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.4">The rise of cloud computing and managed services has also significantly changed how these data systems </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">are managed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">Monitoring and observability have become more proactive and insightful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.2">The rise of AIOps has enabled teams to automatically monitor, analyze, and manage their systems for enhanced performance and to preemptively address issues before they affect the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">user experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">Security has also become a priority, with the rise of DevSecOps, which integrates security practices into the DevOps workflow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.2">Security is now considered at every stage of the development cycle rather than being </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">an afterthought.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">In terms of data, there’s been a shift from just storing and managing data to using it to drive decision-making and business strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.2">This has given rise to practices such as DataOps and MLOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.3">AI and ML are now commonly used in DevOps for tasks such as anomaly detection, forecasting, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">automatic remediation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">Overall, the landscape has evolved from siloed, reactive, and manual processes in 2009 to more integrated, proactive, and automated practices in 2023. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.2">The role of data has also evolved from being a byproduct of operations to a central component driving operational and business decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.3">While the journey hasn’t been without challenges, these advances have led to more efficient, reliable, and secure software delivery </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">and management.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">In the final chapter, we will learn about the exciting new world </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">of data.</span></span></p>
