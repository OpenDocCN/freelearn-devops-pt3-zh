    Those who see you on a frequent basis know exactly who you are and what skills
    you possess; however, to the rest of the world you are defined by your social
    profiles. In this chapter, we will guide you through how to ensure your social
    profiles, resume, and personal web pages match who you have become and what you
    want to accomplish. We will start by refreshing your social profiles, then work
    on your other online sites, such as GitLab and GitHub, and end with ensuring your
    resume matches your social profiles.

    who owns the profile; however, the details describing each experience are often
    lacking, especially if you have been in a role for an extended period. A good
    rule is to update your Experience section each time you finish working on a project
    or initiative. If you are looking for your first role as a DevOps engineer, try
    to highlight the experiences from your past roles that would apply to a role as
    a DevOps engineer.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Skill endorsements can be added by you and validated by any of your first-degree
    connections. The more individuals who validate you for a job, the higher the likelihood
    you will be found when someone searches for the skill. If you are looking for
    a job as a DevOps engineer, getting endorsed for skills such as AWS, Python, and
    DevOps can help you get noticed. To further increase the likelihood of being found
    based on a specific skill, you can take skill assessments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for specific skills; when passed, you receive a badge on your profile telling
    everyone you have passed the skills assessment. This endorsement again raises
    your rank in the search algorithm and increases your chances of being noticed
    by recruiters. The final thing we will discuss is interacting with other professionals

    should fit on a single page. If Elon Musk can fit his experience on one page ([https://novoresume.com/career-blog/elon-musk-one-page-resume](https://novoresume.com/career-blog/elon-musk-one-page-resume)),
    so can you. The purpose of a resume is to allow recruiters and hiring managers
    to gain a quick picture of a candidate in under a minute. Some companies implement
    a computerized layer in the process that scans your resume for keywords and verifies
    requirements prior to it being passed along to a human. Let's look at what should
    be included in the six sections of a resume, starting with contact information.
  prefs: []

    online profiles, email address, and phone number. Including your location and
    personal profile information is recommended, especially if you have just updated
    it. You are not encouraged to include a photo in your resume, as recruiters believe
    this can add bias to the selection process. The next piece of vital information
    is your objective.

    company name. On the other hand, you may want to bulk apply to as many jobs as
    you can; in those cases, you should always have an updated resume with a general
    objective you can use. A keynote about the objective is it should include keywords
    that you want to be noticed, both by an automated checker and a human. In the
    preceding example, we used several keywords, including years of experience. Next,
    we will discuss the largest portion of your resume: your work experience.'

    my competency. One thing known to raise questions is when your resume shows top
    skills that do not reflect the story your experience tells. Saying AWS is a top
    skill when none of your accomplishments for previous roles reflect that is a red
    flag for recruiters and hiring managers. If your experience with AWS has come
    from a large side project you have worked on, you need to include the project
    on your resume.

    used to be a requirement to get into a software engineering/IT-related role. As
    you progressed in your career, it became less and less important until it was
    a non-topic, unless you were looking to move into a leadership role that required
    a master's degree. Now, for a lot of individuals, it started out as a non-topic
    because they were self-taught, or went through a coding boot camp and gained real-world
    experience through internships. This is a step in the right direction. As a hiring
    manager, I am less concerned that you have a four-year degree and more concerned
    that you have a mindset of continual learning.
