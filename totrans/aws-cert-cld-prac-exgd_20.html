			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker1620"/> AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is a 90-minute, multi-choice, and multi-answer-style exam. AWS charges USD 100 to enroll for the exam, which can be booked via their website at <a href="https://www.aws.training/certification">https://www.aws.training/certification</a>. The exams are delivered at test centers located across several cities in many countries or can be taken online at home. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will offer you two complete exam-style mock tests that you can use to gauge your readiness for the official AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. </p>
			<p>These tests comprise 65 questions each with full answer explanations available at the end of this chapter. To effectively use these tests, ensure you follow these steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set aside 90 minutes for each test, where you will not be disturbed. You can use your phone to set an alarm.</li>
				<li>Grab some paper and a pen and for each question, jot down the question's number and the Correct answer.</li>
				<li>Ensure that if you have time left over when you complete the test, you review your answers once more.</li>
				<li>At the end of the 90 minutes, review your answers and compare them with the answer explanation section at the end of this chapter.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You want to be able to answer all the questions correctly before you enter the exam room. You should use these tests to identify any questions that you did not answer correctly and then go back and review the chapter that covers the concepts examined in the question. This way, you will fill any gaps in your knowledge and be in a better position to get a high score on the official exam.</p>
