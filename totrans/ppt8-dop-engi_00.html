			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>As DevOps and platform engineering have pushed demand for powerful internal development platforms, the need for infrastructure automation solutions has never been greater. Puppet is one of the most powerful infrastructure automation solutions used by the largest enterprises in the world and has a strong open source community. This book comprehensively explains both the Puppet language and the platform. Starting with the basic concepts and approach of how Puppet works as a stateful language, it builds up to explaining how to structure Puppet code to scale and allow flexibility and collaboration among teams. It then looks at how the Puppet platform allows management and reporting of infrastructure configuration, showing how the platform can be integrated with other tools such as ServiceNow and Splunk. Finally, approaches will be discussed to understand how to implement Puppet to fit into heavily regulated and audited environments as well as modern hybrid <span class="No-Break">cloud environments.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will have a full understanding of the capabilities of both the Puppet language and platform and be able to structure and scale Puppet to create a platform to provide enterprise-grade <span class="No-Break">infrastructure automation.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is ideal for DevOps engineers looking to automate infrastructure configuration with Puppet. It specifically focuses on Puppet’s configuration management capabilities but goes on to touch on other infrastructure management practices in general. It will allow both beginners and current Puppet users to learn about the full power of the Puppet language <span class="No-Break">and platform.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B18492_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor018"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Puppet Concepts and Practices</em>, focuses on why Puppet was developed, how it has changed over time, and the core concepts and practices of Puppet. It also focuses on how Puppet assists in a DevOps transformation and our approach <span class="No-Break">to it.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Major Changes, Useful Tools, and References</em>, discusses major changes such as harmful terminology, sensitive values, deferred functions, and other high-level items that have emerged since Puppet 5. It will also highlight items that have dropped out of Puppet. It will cover useful tools to assist development, such as VS Code and the <strong class="bold">Puppet Development Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">PDK</strong>), showing how the lab and development environment will work for the book. It will also show various Puppet and community references for <span class="No-Break">further learning.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Puppet Classes, Resource Types, and Providers</em>, introduces the most basic building blocks of Puppet and how to use them so you can understand the initial stages of writing Puppet code, showing how resource types and providers work together to create stateful code independent of the underlying OS implementation and how classes allow us to group <span class="No-Break">these resources.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Variables and Data Types</em>, details how to assign variables with data types in Puppet, how they can be managed in arrays and hashes, the use of the sensitive data type to secure variables, and how the variable scope is managed. Then, we’ll provide some best practice advice on how to use these variables and data structures well <span class="No-Break">within Puppet.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Facts and Functions</em>, looks at the facts and factors that it provides, how to use them in Puppet code, and how to customize them. It will also look at functions: what they are, how lambdas can be used with them, and how the relatively recent deferred functions can be used <span class="No-Break">with them</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor185"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Relationships, Ordering, and Scope</em>, covers how Puppet handles relationships and order as well as scope and containment. These issues come together to help the user understand how cross-module or cross-class resources and variables <span class="No-Break">will intersect.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor194"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Templating, Iterating</em><em class="italic">, and Conditionals</em>, shows how to use templates, iteration, loops, and various conditional statements, such as <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> cases and selectors to affect the flow and management <span class="No-Break">of code.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor212"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Developing and Managing Modules</em>, discusses the structure of modules, the use of the PDK to create them, and how we can test modules. It will also discuss how to use Puppet Forge well to both consume and share code and understand the quality of <span class="No-Break">shared modules.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor233"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Handling Data with Puppet</em>, runs through how Puppet handles data, discussing what Hiera is, at what levels to store data, and some pitfalls and mistakes to avoid in structure <span class="No-Break">and approach.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/></em><a href="B18492_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor252"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Puppet Platform Parts and Functions</em>, helps you understand what Puppet is as a platform, how the various components work together and communicate, and common architecture approaches to <span class="No-Break">deliver scale.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Classification and Release Management</em>, discusses how Puppet manages servers and code in environments, how servers can be classified, and how the Puppet run of this classification actually runs. The tooling to deploy code into these environments will also <span class="No-Break">be discussed.</span></p>

You will see how tasks and plans can complement Puppet code and how Puppet code can be orchestrated and deployed via <span class="No-Break">Bolt itself.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor321"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Taking Puppet Server Further</em>, looks at more advanced topics to ensure you can monitor and scale your infrastructure, deal with common issues, and integrate external <span class="No-Break">data sources.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18492_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor340"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">A Brief Overview of Puppet Enterprise</em>, highlights the differences between Puppet Enterprise compared to open source, and the integrations and services available to help scale and <span class="No-Break">tune infrastructure.</span></p>
