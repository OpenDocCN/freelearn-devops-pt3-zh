    business data.

    the associated `CaseFeed`, `CaseHistory`, and `CaseShare` objects may not provide
    much backup value for the same rationale. Omitting these objects can result in
    more compact backups, facilitating quicker backup and restoration processes –
    in the case of sharing tables, these are dynamically recreated once the records
    to which they relate are restored. Employing a backup solution that allows you
    to track and assess your data’s modifications will be even more effective if you
    exclude high-churn objects. This exclusion streamlines your monitoring process,

    Delving into backup analytics can shed light on whether the data was corrupted

    data from being inadvertently overwritten.

    the authority to mandate virtually any company – even those outside the EU and
    EEA – to eliminate their data from the company’s archives within a stipulated
    30-day period. Consequently, businesses catering to EU and EEA clientele must

    bestows comparable rights to California’s residents. While the CCPA’s purview
    is somewhat narrower than the GDPR’s, it imposes specific criteria that companies
    must fulfill before being accountable for CCPA-related requests. Notably, like
    its European counterpart, the CCPA empowers individuals to inquire about their
    held data and demand its removal. As these regulations become increasingly standard,
    businesses should anticipate the need to adhere to either or both the GDPR and
    CCPA. Thus, evaluating backup strategies for compliance with these data protection
    norms is indispensable.

    data retention policies to govern how long backup data persists before deletion.
    Organizations take varied approaches to retention depending on business needs,
    legal factors, and budget constraints.
  id: totrans-151
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many default to indefinite data retention to maximize the historical snapshots
    available for recovery. With no set deletion schedules, all backup data is perpetually
    available. This ensures confidence that even very old backup copies can be accessed
    if needed to restore lost production data or address a historical audit. However,
    indefinite retention leads to continuously expanding storage consumption and cost
    over time as new backups accumulate.
  id: totrans-152
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other companies choose to implement limited data retention windows that automatically
    delete backups after a set period. Retention may be mandated by industry regulations
    requiring data to be kept only for a specific number of years due to privacy statutes.
    Contractual clauses with customers or partners may also dictate maximal retention
    timeframes. From a budget perspective, deleting backups periodically helps control
    the otherwise unlimited growth in storage expenses that’s inevitable with indefinite
    retention approaches.
  id: totrans-153
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some organizations align backup data retention schedules with their consumer
    data retention policies, which limit how long they persist personal information.
    This ensures backups reflect corporate deletion commitments. However, it can pose
    risks if valuable historical business data is deleted prematurely alongside expired
    consumer records. A better approach is to retain business data indefinitely while
    deleting only consumer data from backups based on data types.
  id: totrans-154
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tradeoff with limited retention policies is that the availability of snapshots
    for historical recovery diminishes over time. While recent backup data is maintained,
    older backups eventually get deleted forever. So, retention schedules imply a
    tolerance for permanently losing access to dated records after the retention period
    elapses.
  id: totrans-155
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In regulated industries such as financial services and healthcare, retention
    minimums may be mandated for certain data types, allowing early deletion of other
    data past a specific age. Compliance factors should be incorporated when defining
    retention policies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, organizations need to weigh the pros and cons of varied retention
    approaches based on their unique business needs, data recovery requirements, growth
    constraints, and legal obligations. However, having explicit formal data retention
    policies for backups provides consistency, predictability, and alignment with
    corporate data governance standards. As with all data policies, retention guidelines
    should be reviewed regularly.

    metadata and data backup represents a significant advancement over manual approaches.
    In scenarios where catastrophic failures occur, a VCS can act as a reliable source
    for disaster recovery, enabling teams to redeploy the entire metadata to a new
    Salesforce org, ensuring business continuity. Additionally, maintaining a detailed
    history of changes is crucial for audit trails and compliance requirements, which
    VCS facilitates by tracking changes in a structured and accessible manner.
  id: totrans-165
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the reliance on VCSs for backup in Salesforce DevOps is not without
    its challenges and limitations. The complexity of incorporating VCSs into Salesforce
    necessitates a deep understanding of both the Salesforce environment and version
    control practices, which can be daunting, especially for click-based admins who
    are not familiar with version control. The risk of overwriting existing code or
    introducing updates that conflict with the main repository is heightened when
    multiple developers work on the same project, even though VCSs offer a failsafe
    for overwrites.
  id: totrans-166
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scope of VCSs is limited in capturing the nuances of Salesforce data, which
    might lead to incomplete backups and recovery challenges. The dependency on external
    tools introduces additional points of failure in the backup and recovery process,
    making it time and resource-intensive. VCSs might not be sufficient for full disaster
    recovery in cases of complete system failure or data corruption.
  id: totrans-167

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Achieving a seamless and efficient integration of VCS that is accessible and
    user-friendly for Salesforce admins presents a significant challenge. Ensuring
    compliance with data protection laws and security standards adds another layer
    of complexity to using a VCS as a backup solution. Inefficient use of a VCS can
    lead to increased technical debt, especially if deployments frequently encounter
    bugs and errors, and the potential for increased technical debt looms. Without
    a comprehensive VCS strategy, there may be a lack of complete visibility into
    the history and context of changes, hindering debugging, decision-making, and
    understanding the impact of specific changes in the Salesforce environment.

    types and corresponding data in Salesforce cannot be restored. These considerations
    should be part of the architectural planning for backup and disaster recovery
    so that the business understands the limits of what can be restored. As a simple
    example, in most cases, you won’t get the original Salesforce record IDs back
    after restoring a record, so other systems should not necessarily rely on record
    IDs.
