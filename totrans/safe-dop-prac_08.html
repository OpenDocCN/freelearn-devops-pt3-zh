			<h1 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Measuring Value Stream Performance</h1>
			<p>In our last chapter, we started our exploration of Value Streams by referring to the Three Ways found in <em class="italic">The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win</em>. The First Way was about achieving flow through the establishment of <span class="No-Break">Value Streams.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter moves beyond the establishment of Value Streams to verify their performance. For this chapter, we look at the Second Way: <em class="italic">amplify feedback loops</em>. To follow the Second Way, we need to look for and pay attention to the feedback from our <span class="No-Break">Value Streams.</span></p>
			<p>We can use metrics as a feedback mechanism. There are a few metrics frameworks that have emerged, such as <strong class="bold">DevOps Research and Assessment</strong> (<strong class="bold">DORA</strong>) metrics and the Flow Framework®, that can function as <span class="No-Break">feedback loops.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover the following topics in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating <span class="No-Break">good measurements</span></li>
				<li>Looking at the <span class="No-Break">DORA metrics</span></li>
				<li>Looking at the Flow Framework® and <span class="No-Break">Flow Metrics</span></li>
				<li>Understanding measurements <span class="No-Break">in SAFe®</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s begin by understanding how to get <span class="No-Break">effective feedback.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Creating good measurements</h1>
			<p>We originally saw the <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>different types of measurements we can apply in <a href="B18756_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor114"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Measuring the Process and Solution</em>, where we looked at measurements in three of the <span class="No-Break">following areas:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <span class="No-Break">development process</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">The environment</span></li>
				<li>The customer <span class="No-Break">value delivered</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The set of metrics that can <a id="_idIndexMarker564"/>adequately cover these three areas of measurement are called <strong class="bold">Key Performance </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Indicators</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">KPIs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>KPIs are metrics chosen to determine whether an individual, a team, a Value Stream or an <strong class="bold">Agile Release Train</strong> (<strong class="bold">ART</strong>) in our case is meeting its goals. KPIs are evaluated both at specific points in <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>time as well as over a given time period to highlight trends and movements away from or toward <span class="No-Break">a goal.</span></p>
			<p>KPIs should be objective measurements and not subject to opinion <span class="No-Break">or interpretation.</span></p>
			<p>While looking at <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>these measurements, we cautioned against using vanity metrics, which are measurements that yield good information but don’t really supply any meaningful data. Examples of this include the number of hits on a website or the cumulative number of subscribers to <span class="No-Break">a service.</span></p>
			<p>To set up KPIs, let’s look <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>at the steps in the following diagram, as advised <span class="No-Break">by </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">kpi.org</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.1 — KPI establishment process</p>
			<p>Let’s look at each step <span class="No-Break">in detail.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Describing the goal or intended result</h2>
			<p>When looking at the intended goal, it’s important to understand whether it is a strategic goal or a result that is <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>more tactical. The desired goal should be a concise, concrete result rather than a <span class="No-Break">broad objective.</span></p>
			<p>In this way, KPIs are different from <strong class="bold">Objectives and Key Results</strong> (<strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>). OKRs generally describe <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>broad strategic goals with desired results as the measurement of whether that strategic goal was achieved. An example of an OKR is <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>shown in the <span class="No-Break">following table:</span></p>
			<table id="table001-4" class="No-Table-Style">
				<colgroup>
					<col/>
					<col/>
				</colgroup>
				<tbody>
					<tr class="No-Table-Style">
						<td class="No-Table-Style">

						</td>
						<td class="No-Table-Style">
							<p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Key Results</strong></span></p>

					</tr>
					<tr class="No-Table-Style">

					<tr class="No-Table-Style">
						<td class="No-Table-Style">

						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="No-Table-Style">
						<td class="No-Table-Style">
							<p>The number of monthly active users goes up from 56% <span class="No-Break">to 65%</span></p>
						</td>
					</tr>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 8.1 — Example of an OKR</p>
			<p> A KPI points to whether a concrete target was achieved. An example of a KPI would be the <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>measurement of <strong class="bold">Net Promoter Score</strong> (<strong class="bold">NPS</strong>) survey results from <span class="No-Break">favorite customers.</span></p>
			<p>If you have performed a value stream mapping as shown in the last chapter, <a href="B18756_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor163"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping Your Value Streams</em>, then the desired future state of your value stream is an effective tactical goal that your ART or value stream can <span class="No-Break">strive toward.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Understanding the method for measuring the goal</h2>
			<p>For your intended goal, you need to understand how the measurements will work. Are there direct <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>measurements that will correspond to the intended goal? If so, those should be the measures <span class="No-Break">you use.</span></p>
			<p>However, what happens if you cannot directly measure the intended goal? In that case, you may need to look at creating hypotheses and measuring the results against the hypotheses <span class="No-Break">as experiments.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Selecting measures for each goal</h2>
			<p>With the goals in place and possible measurements defined for each goal, it’s time to winnow down your choices to the important measurements to take. In most cases, a total of five to seven KPIs is enough to get an adequate picture of how the value stream is doing. It’s better to focus on a few key measurements as opposed to being awash in a sea <span class="No-Break">of data.</span></p>
			<p>We want <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>the following characteristics for <span class="No-Break">our KPIs:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Answer questions about our performance in line with <span class="No-Break">our objectives</span></li>
				<li>Provide clear information needed <span class="No-Break">for strategy</span></li>
				<li>Are valid and can <span class="No-Break">be verified</span></li>
				<li>Encourage desirable <span class="No-Break">employee behavior</span></li>
				<li>Are not difficult <span class="No-Break">to acquire</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we have our measurements, we need to see what the ideal values are for our <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Defining composite indices if needed</h2>
			<p>There may be some measures that cannot individually provide all of the information to get the intended result. This is especially pertinent when the intended result is intangible, such as <span class="No-Break">customer satisfaction.</span></p>
			<p>When that is the case, you may need to bundle individual measurements into a composite index so that analysis <span class="No-Break">becomes easier.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Defining targets or thresholds</h2>
			<p>We want to see <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>how we are performing against the KPI. To judge our performance, we need to set a target value for each KPI. This target value should reside in a threshold for optimum performance. Thresholds should also be defined for <span class="No-Break">poor performance.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Defining and documenting the selected measurements</h2>
			<p>We have now defined our KPIs, as well as target values and thresholds for good, satisfactory, and poor performance. It’s time to expand and detail other information about <span class="No-Break">our KPIs.</span></p>
			<p>The following additional information may help when collecting and analyzing <span class="No-Break">our KPIs:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Its <span class="No-Break">intended goal</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">The KPI</span></li>
				<li>A description of the KPI </li>
				<li>The type <span class="No-Break">of measurement</span></li>
				<li>The formula to calculate <span class="No-Break">the measurement</span></li>
				<li>Units <span class="No-Break">of measure</span></li>
				<li>Where the measurement <span class="No-Break">is stored</span></li>
				<li>Who makes the measurement and is responsible <span class="No-Break">for it</span></li>
				<li>The <span class="No-Break">data source</span></li>
				<li>The frequency at which it is collected <span class="No-Break">and reported</span></li>
				<li>The individuals responsible <span class="No-Break">for validation</span></li>
				<li>The individuals responsible <span class="No-Break">for verification</span></li>
				<li>The method of presenting <span class="No-Break">the KPI</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>For a development value stream, it may be acceptable to start with a standard set of KPIs. One standard of <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>this kind was devised by DORA and examined in annual surveys. Let’s look at these metrics and see their applicability for a new development <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>DORA metrics</h1>
			<p>Since 2014, an <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>annual report detailing the state of DevOps adoption has been published by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, and Jez Humble of DORA and Alanna Brown of Puppet. Each year, they detail the general state of DevOps adoption and the maturity of respondents in adopting <span class="No-Break">DevOps practices.</span></p>
			<p>In 2016, they outlined certain metrics meant to measure the throughput and stability of DevOps practices across different organizations. These metrics have come to be known as <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">DORA metrics</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The annual <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>report has served as a barometer of the extent to which DevOps practices are being incorporated and how effectively this is being done. Each year, the report identifies the <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>following aspects of the <span class="No-Break">DevOps movement:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Key KPIs</span></li>
				<li>Performance levels of organizations based on <span class="No-Break">the KPIs</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Upcoming trends</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s look at each of these <span class="No-Break">aspects now.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>The DORA KPI metrics</h2>
			<p>The Accelerate <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>State of DevOps report looks at the following four metrics to determine performance levels for <span class="No-Break">participating organizations:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Lead time</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Deployment frequency</span></li>
				<li>Change <span class="No-Break">failure rate</span></li>
				<li>Mean time <span class="No-Break">to repair</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The first two metrics measure an organization’s velocity, or how quickly it can deliver changes to production. The third and fourth metrics determine an organization’s stability, or how well an organization can keep its production <span class="No-Break">environment running.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at these metrics in <span class="No-Break">more detail.</span></p>
			<h3>Lead time</h3>
			<p>We have discussed <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>lead time before in our previous chapter, <a href="B18756_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor163"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping Your Value Streams</em>. In it, we saw that each process step has a lead time. The total lead time was the sum of the lead times of all the <span class="No-Break">process steps.</span></p>
			<p>The DORA metrics look for the lead time for changes – that is, the length of time from a commit to the version control repository to the deployment of that code into a production environment. This is a subset of the total lead time. The authors of the book <em class="italic">Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations</em>, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim (all key contributors to the definition of DORA metrics), specify the delivery lead time and disregard any lead time related to design. This is primarily due to the uncertainty of when to <em class="italic">start the clock</em> for the design lead time. The delivery lead time is easier to measure and is resistant to <span class="No-Break">any variability.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at the following illustration of a sample <span class="No-Break">value stream:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer085" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_08_02.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1 — Sample ﻿﻿value stream for DORA lead time"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.1 — Sample value stream for DORA lead time</p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, we see that with Continuous Integration, automation performs tests in a <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>non-production environment. If no errors are found, this process takes 4 hours, and the changes are deployed to a <span class="No-Break">staging environment.</span></p>
			<p>In the staging environment, perhaps automated testing is not performed. This may explain why the time to move from a staging environment to a production environment takes <span class="No-Break">40 hours.</span></p>
			<p>So, for this value stream we total the times for each stage (4 hours + 40 hours), resulting in a total lead time of <span class="No-Break">44 hours.</span></p>
			<h3>Deployment frequency</h3>
			<p>The DORA metrics look <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>at how frequently organizations can successfully deploy code to production with <span class="No-Break">this KPI.</span></p>
			<p>If we continue with our value stream example that has a lead time of 44 hours, or 1.83 days (given that lead times are measured against a 24/7 calendar), we can see that they deploy <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>roughly 16 times <span class="No-Break">per month.</span></p>
			<h3>Change failure rate</h3>
			<p>This metric is the examination of quality in the deployment process. It measures how often a release to <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>production results in a degraded or failed service that requires a fix, either by rolling back or patching and implementing <span class="No-Break">a hotfix.</span></p>
			<p>Determining the change failure rate comes from examining the record of deployments and seeing whether any directly led to any <span class="No-Break">production failures.</span></p>
			<p>Suppose that in our value stream, we looked at the past 12 deployments. Of those 12 deployments, the production environment experienced <span class="No-Break">three problems.</span></p>
			<p>Our change failure rate would come from the <span class="No-Break">following calculation:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer086" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Formula_08_001.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>				 = 3/12 = <span class="No-Break">25%</span></p>
			<h3>Recovery time</h3>
			<p>This metric looks <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>at instances where service incidents occurred in production environments. For those incidents, how long did it take to <span class="No-Break">restore service?</span></p>
			<p>Often, when there is more than one incident, the metric for recovery time is expressed as the <strong class="bold">Mean Time to Recovery</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTR</strong>), or the average time <span class="No-Break">to recover.</span></p>
			<p>In our value stream, for those three failures that were experienced in the past 12 deployments, if the times to repair for each failure were 3 hours, 2 hours, and 7 hours, the mean time to repair would be that shown in the <span class="No-Break">following calculation:</span></p>
			<p><img src="image/Formula_08_002.png" alt=""/> = <span class="No-Break">4 hours</span></p>
			<p>For the preceding four metrics, DORA has done a cluster analysis of the responses and established four performance levels. Let’s look at <span class="No-Break">these levels.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>DORA metric performance levels</h2>
			<p>Every year <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>in the Accelerate State of DevOps report, DORA analyzes the responses to view the levels of performance among the respondents. From the four DORA metric KPIs, they have created the following four <span class="No-Break">performance levels:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Elite</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">High</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Medium</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Low</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The criteria for each level change every year that the survey is produced. This is due to an overall improvement in practices not only at each organization but also within the industry as a whole. The 2021 report saw an increase in the number of respondents that were at the Elite or High performer levels compared with previous years, signifying the role continuous improvement plays in adopting <span class="No-Break">DevOps practices.</span></p>
			<p>The 2022 State of <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>DevOps report saw a major change in these performance levels. For the first time, the Elite tier was removed. The survey results indicated that the highest-performing group was not performing at the same level as the Elite tier in the previous year. More data is required to look for <span class="No-Break">possible reasons.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Emerging trends from the State of DevOps report</h2>
			<p>To adjust to <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>changing times, the survey also includes ancillary questions about the organization’s environment in order to view emerging aspects. The two most recent reports (2021 and 2022) included the following <span class="No-Break">additional items:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Since 2018, DORA has added another metric: reliability. This measure looks at performance beyond software delivery into how well an organization maintains its environments or <span class="No-Break">operational performance.</span></li>
				<li>DORA has investigated the adoption of cloud infrastructures since 2019, noting that the adoption of cloud technologies is an enabling technology that improves all four DORA <span class="No-Break">metric KPIs.</span></li>
				<li>The 2021 report started investigating the adoption of SRE practices, as a way of finding a correlation <span class="No-Break">with reliability.</span></li>
				<li>In addition to inquiring about technical DevOps practices, DORA has expanded the scope of its inquiry to include documentation and security practices integrated into the <span class="No-Break">development process.</span></li>
				<li>Because of the disruption to established work patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, questions were included to gauge the resiliency of organizations to continue delivering while <span class="No-Break">avoiding burnout.</span></li>
				<li>As part of the inquiry of security practices, the 2022 State of DevOps report inquired <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>about whether companies <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>had adopted measures to ensure the security of their software supply chain. These measures fall into one of two frameworks for standardization: <strong class="bold">Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLSA</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">Secure Software Development </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Framework</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">SSDF</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The DORA metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>offer a good elementary look at KPIs to measure, but often, not all the work done by value streams is directly related to providing customer value. To measure those KPIs, adopting the Flow Framework® and measuring the Flow Metrics® may be a good option. Let’s now take a look at the Flow <span class="No-Break">Framework® model.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Flow Framework® and Flow Metrics®</h1>
			<p>The Flow Framework® model is described in detail in Mik Kersten’s book <em class="italic">Project to Product: How to Survive and Thrive in the Age of Digital Disruption with the Flow Framework</em>. In this <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>book, Kersten describes the need to move from <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>project-based design to product development using long-lived <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>To measure the performance of the value streams, Kersten proposes the Flow Framework®, a structure of Flow artifacts and the measurement of those artifacts using <span class="No-Break">Flow Metrics®.</span></p>
			<p>Kersten initially formulated the Flow Framework® in order to measure the flow of software delivery for his company, Tasktop. While looking at the value streams at Tasktop, Kersten identified the following four outcomes that he wanted <span class="No-Break">to monitor:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Value</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Cost</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Quality</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Happiness</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>He related these <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>items to four Flow Items, which were the types of work <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>done by Tasktop’s value streams. To track the progress of these Flow Items, Kersten found four Flow Metrics® that these Flow <span class="No-Break">Items exhibited.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s start our look at the Flow Framework® by examining the four <span class="No-Break">Flow Items.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Flow Items</h2>
			<p>Kersten identified <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>the following four types of work done by a <span class="No-Break">value stream:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Features <span class="No-Break">to deliver</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Defect fixes</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Risk avoidance</span></li>
				<li>Technical <span class="No-Break">debt reduction</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each item has unique differences in terms of the stakeholders that desire them and the value of <span class="No-Break">these items.</span></p>
			<h3>Features</h3>
			<p>Features are items <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>that bring about direct business value. Customers pull features from the value stream to provide the solutions they want or need. This work is considered the primary type of work a value stream <span class="No-Break">will deliver.</span></p>
			<p>In SAFe®, Flow Framework® features can be mapped to features, the items of work that are decomposed into <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>user stories and enabler stories, which have a timebox of one <strong class="bold">Program </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Increment</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">PI</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<h3>Defect fixes</h3>
			<p>A value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>may also work on fixing any defects discovered. These fixes may be for defects uncovered during the development process or defects that have made their way to production. Regardless of when the defect was discovered, the fix is pulled by the customer as part of <span class="No-Break">the solution.</span></p>
			<p>SAFe does not directly identify separate work for fixing defects, but that work is frequently tracked as part of the work tracking system that value streams use. An example of this is when value streams using Jira identify a distinct issue type (bug) to track the effort to <span class="No-Break">fix defects.</span></p>
			<h3>Risk avoidance</h3>
			<p>Value streams may <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>work in organizations where compliance, security, governance, and privacy are important <strong class="bold">Non-Functional Requirements</strong> (<strong class="bold">NFRs</strong>). These NFRs may be related to the industry they’re in, which <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>may have important contractual requirements or regulations to comply with. Items meant to reduce risks are delivered by the value stream to different stakeholders. These stakeholders are frequently internal to the organization, such as security or <span class="No-Break">governance groups.</span></p>
			<p>In SAFe, items that are meant to fulfill NFRs and mitigate or eliminate risks are compliance enablers. Compliance enablers that are timeboxed to a PI are identified as features meant for an ART to accomplish while story-sized compliance enablers are worked on by an individual team inside <span class="No-Break">the ART.</span></p>
			<h3>Technical debt reduction</h3>
			<p>Paring down technical debt is an important kind of work that value streams carry out. If technical debt is <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>not managed to a controllable level, the delivery of the other Flow Framework® items (features, defect fixes, and risk avoidance) will be impacted due to deficiencies in <span class="No-Break">the architecture.</span></p>
			<p>SAFe categorizes Flow Framework® debt items as enablers. We have seen compliance enablers when talking about Flow Framework® risks. The other types of enablers help to maintain the architecture of a product <span class="No-Break">or solution.</span></p>
			<p>Infrastructure enablers are used by ARTs and teams to enhance the development process. Work of this <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>kind includes the incorporation and maintenance of automation for testing <span class="No-Break">and deployment.</span></p>
			<p>Architectural enablers directly improve the architecture of the ART’s produ<a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>ct or solution. A series of <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>architectural enablers created so that these enhancements can be utilized by future features is known as the <span class="No-Break">Architectural Runway.</span></p>
			<p>Exploration enablers allow team members of the ART to research unknown technologies or determine the best <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>functional approach. Spikes are a prevalent example of <span class="No-Break">exploration enablers.</span></p>
			<p>Value streams that use the Flow Framework® for measurement divide their work into all four of these Flow Items. We will now take a look at the measurements applied to <span class="No-Break">these items.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Flow Metrics</h2>
			<p>In the Flow Framework®, we want to see how well our value stream is performing against all the <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>kinds of work there are. To do that, we will apply the following measurements to each <span class="No-Break">Flow Item:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Flow Velocity®</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Flow Time®</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Flow Load®</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Flow Efficiency®</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, we have one more metric, Flow Distribution®, so we can see which Flow Items the value stream works <span class="No-Break">on most.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look further into each <span class="No-Break">metric now.</span></p>
			<h3>Flow Velocity®</h3>
			<p>Flow Velocity® looks at the <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>number of Flow Items, regardless of type, completed in a standard unit of time. The following diagram illustrates Flow Velocity® for a <span class="No-Break">Value Stream:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.3 — Illustration of Flow Velocity® (Copyright © 2018 Tasktop Technologies, Incorporated. All rights reserved. Published with permission)</p>
			<p>This is <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>analogous to measuring the velocity in Scrum. A value stream that is stable and working well will maintain consistent Flow Velocities® across multiple periods <span class="No-Break">of time.</span></p>
			<h3>Flow Time®</h3>
			<p>Flow time® is the time <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>to complete an individual Flow Item as it traverses the value stream, from when it is accepted into the value stream to when it is released by the value stream. The Flow Time® includes both active times and wait times. The following diagram illustrates <span class="No-Break">Flow Time®:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer089" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_08_04.jpg" alt="Figure 8.4 – Illustration of ﻿Flow Time® (Copyright © 2018 Tasktop Technologies Incorporated. All rights reserved. Published with permission)"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.4 – Illustration of Flow Time® (Copyright © 2018 Tasktop Technologies Incorporated. All rights reserved. Published with permission)</p>
			<p>The difference <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>between Flow Time® and lead time is that the latter is a customer metric. With Flow Time®, we’re looking to determine the length of time needed to develop our product <span class="No-Break">or solution.</span></p>
			<h3>Flow Load®</h3>
			<p>We discussed the <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>problems with having large numbers of WIP in <a href="B18756_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>,<em class="italic"> Leveraging Lean Flow to Keep the Work Moving</em>. Flow Load® is a measure of WIP. As shown in the following diagram, we can see the number of Flow Items that are in progress with <span class="No-Break">Flow Load®:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer090" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_08_05.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5 – Illustration of ﻿Flow Load® (Copyright© 2018 Tasktop Technologies Incorporated. All rights reserved. Published with permission)"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.5 – Illustration of Flow Load® (Copyright© 2018 Tasktop Technologies Incorporated. All rights reserved. Published with permission)</p>
			<p>Remember that just as high numbers of WIP lead to longer lead times and reduced performance, high Flow Load® values are an indicator of reduced performance that will result in longer Flow Times® and reduced <span class="No-Break">Flow Velocity®.</span></p>
			<h3>Flow Efficiency®</h3>
			<p>We looked at <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>Flow Time® earlier and saw that it includes both times when the value stream is actively working and times when it is idle, waiting at some process step. You can figure out the efficiency by looking at the ratio of active time to <span class="No-Break">Flow Time®.</span></p>
			<p>The following diagram completes our preceding Flow Time® example by calculating the <span class="No-Break">Flow Efficiency®:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer091" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_08_06.jpg" alt="Figure 8.6 – Illustration of ﻿Flow Efficiency® (Copyright © 2018 Tasktop Technologies Incorporated. All rights reserved. Published with permission.)"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.6 – Illustration of Flow Efficiency® (Copyright © 2018 Tasktop Technologies Incorporated. All rights reserved. Published with permission.)</p>
			<p>Flow Efficiency® is analogous to <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>activity ratio, which was introduced in <a href="B18756_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor163"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping Your Value Streams</em>. The difference is that Flow Efficiency® looks at the development perspective of the <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<h3>Flow Distribution®</h3>
			<p>When looking at the Flow Metrics®  so far, we have not considered the type of Flow Item that is being measured. We <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>will now look to Flow Distribution® to guide us on whether the work of our value stream <span class="No-Break">is balanced.</span></p>
			<p>Flow Distribution® looks at the number of Flow Items complete for a value stream and measures each type of Flow Item as a percentage of the total number of Flow Items. A calculation of Flow Distribution® is demonstrated by the <span class="No-Break">following diagram:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer092" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_08_07.jpg" alt="Figure 8.7 – Illustration of ﻿Flow Distribution® (Copyright © 2018 Tasktop Technologies Incorporated. All rights reserved. Published with permission)"/>

			<p>In SAFe, looking at <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>the Flow Distribution® allows the ART to determine the proper allocation ratio of features and enablers so that a proper balance of delivering the customer value and ensuring that the needed enhancements <span class="No-Break">are made.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>Measurements in SAFe</h1>
			<p>When looking at an organization’s value streams realized as ARTs, Scaled Agile recommends <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>viewing their performance in terms of these three <span class="No-Break">following aspects:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Outcomes</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Flow</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Competency</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s see how these three aspects are measured <span class="No-Break">in SAFe.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Measuring outcomes in SAFe</h2>
			<p>The primary <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>mechanism for measuring outcomes comes from establishing and measuring value <span class="No-Break">stream KPIs.</span></p>
			<p>We saw KPI frameworks for measuring customer outcomes, such as <strong class="bold">Pirate</strong> (<strong class="bold">ARRRR</strong>) metrics and Fit-for-Purpose <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>metrics, in <a href="B18756_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor114"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Measuring the Process and Solution</em>. Determining the set of KPIs for your team or ART was discussed earlier in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Validating the benefit hypothesis that comes from Epics, large pieces of work, may lead to desirable <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>outcomes. Epic development is done experimentally by creating a <strong class="bold">Minimum Viable Product</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>) and using leading indicators to measure the hypothesized value. Closely monitoring the leading indicators produces evidence that either validates or invalidates the Epic hypothesis, allowing us to <em class="italic">pivot or persevere</em> with further <span class="No-Break">Epic development.</span></p>
			<p>Agile teams on the ART also want to measure the Iteration Goals they create at every iteration, as well as the PI Objectives they create for every PI. These goals and objectives help the teams focus their efforts, not on completing every feature and story, but on making sure customer value <span class="No-Break">is delivered.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>Measuring the Flow in SAFe</h2>
			<p>Some of the value stream KPIs a team or ART decide to adopt will be related to performance in terms <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>of ensuring the delivery of value. Scaled Agile has recommended using the Flow Metrics® from the Flow Framework® to ensure that the flow successfully results in the delivery of the product. The Flow Items and Flow Metrics® against those items have been discussed in the <span class="No-Break">preceding section.</span></p>
			<p>In addition, Scaled Agile recommends an additional Flow Metric: Flow Predictability. This metric measures how well teams and the ART can plan their PI and meet their <span class="No-Break">PI Objectives.</span></p>
			<p>To measure Flow Predictability, teams and the ART use the SAFe <strong class="bold">Program Predictability Measure</strong> (<strong class="bold">PPM</strong>). To calculate the PPM, teams look at the original Business Value of <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>the PI Objectives determined during PI Planning. They then compare the sum of these against the actual Business Value for both committed and uncommitted PI Objectives determined in the Inspect and Adapt workshop at the end of the PI. The measure is determined by the <span class="No-Break">following equation:</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>Measuring competency in SAFe</h2>
			<p>On a grander scale, an enterprise that utilizes SAFe strives for business agility, where strategy and <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>execution are combined to achieve business results through the frequent delivery of <span class="No-Break">customer value.</span></p>
			<p>Business agility in SAFe is measured through self-assessment of the following seven core competencies practiced by different parts of <span class="No-Break">the organization:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Team and <span class="No-Break">technical agility</span></li>
				<li>Agile <span class="No-Break">product delivery</span></li>
				<li>Enterprise <span class="No-Break">solution delivery</span></li>

				<li>Continuous <span class="No-Break">learning culture</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile leadership</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The teams and the ART use the DevOps Health Radar to assess their competency in adopting DevOps principles and practices. Let’s take a look at how to use the DevOps <span class="No-Break">Health Radar.</span></p>
			<h3>The DevOps Health Radar</h3>
			<p>The DevOps Health Radar is a <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>tool that lists all the activities related to the <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>four aspects of the Continuous Delivery Pipeline. An illustration of the DevOps Health Radar is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.9 – DevOps Health Radar (©Scaled Agile, Inc. All rights reserved)</p>
			<p>For each of the 16 activities of the Continuous Delivery Pipeline, the teams and ART rate themselves in terms of their maturity in performing the activity. Ratings range from Sit (1 to 2), Crawl (3 to 4), Walk (5 to 6), Run (7 to 8), and Fly (9 to 10), <span class="No-Break">the apex.</span></p>
			<p>Teams and the ART should periodically self-assess with the DevOps Health Radar to track the maturity of <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>their DevOps performance. This assessment is <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>available for free on the Scaled Agile Framework website at <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/?ddownload=38794">https://www.scaledagileframework.com/?ddownload=38794</a>.We will examine the Continuous Delivery Pipeline and its activities in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Part 3</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we wanted to ensure that we were on the right track by adopting the Second Way through amplifying feedback loops. The key feedback loops that we will use for our value streams are <span class="No-Break">often metrics.</span></p>
			<p>When selecting metrics, we want to view them as KPIs. We saw how to start with our desired objectives, look at the metrics that line up with our objectives, refine a set of metrics to collect, and collect them <span class="No-Break">as KPIs.</span></p>
			<p>We first looked at one standard of metrics to use as part of our set of KPIs: the DORA metrics that form the basis of the annual Accelerate State of DevOps report. By collecting these metrics and continuously improving, a value stream may be identified with a performance level based on comparison with other organizations as collected by the <span class="No-Break">annual report.</span></p>
			<p>If looking at other types of work beyond those that provide customer value, a value stream may look at the Flow Framework® created by Tasktop. With the Flow Framework®, we outlined the four Flow Items that define the type of work done by the value stream. We also set four Flow Metrics® against individual Flow Items and applied Flow Distribution® to a set of <span class="No-Break">Flow Items.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve seen how we can view measurements of our feedback, we will move on to the Third Way, where we apply Continuous Experimentation and Learning. We will discover the methods for doing so in our <span class="No-Break">next chapter.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/>Questions</h1>
