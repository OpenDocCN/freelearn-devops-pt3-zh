			<p>The new and improved Second Edition of this book goes beyond just the fundamentals of DevOps tools and their deployments. It covers practical examples to get you up to speed with containers, infrastructure automation, serverless container services, continuous integration and delivery, automated deployments, deployment pipeline security, and operating your services in production, all using containers and GitOps as a <span class="No-Break">special focus.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>If you are a software engineer, system administrator, or operations engineer looking to step into the world of DevOps within public cloud platforms, this book is for you. Current DevOps engineers will also find this book useful, as it covers the best practices, tips, and tricks to implement DevOps with a cloud-native mindset. Although no containerization experience is necessary, a basic understanding of the software development life cycle and delivery will help you get the most out of <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
