			<p class="author-quote">“Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence.” – Vince Lombardi, one of the greatest American football coaches</p>
			<p>In an era where business efficiency and value creation are not just goals but survival strategies in <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>the global competitive landscape, understanding and implementing <strong class="bold">value</strong> <strong class="bold">stream</strong> <strong class="bold">management </strong>(<strong class="bold">VSM</strong>) is essential. When your organization embraces VSM, a continuous transformation journey will drive your organization closer to the ever-elusive goal of perfection. The significance of VSM in fostering ongoing personal and organizational growth is immense, regardless of <span class="No-Break">your role.</span></p>
			<p>But why is this relentless pursuit important? Without the iterative, adaptive approach of VSM, organizations risk stagnation and decline. Ignoring the principles of continuous improvement and strategic prioritization can lead to inefficiency, misallocated resources, employee burnout, and, ultimately, a reduction in quality and customer satisfaction. Embracing VSM as a continuous evolutionary path ensures that every step taken leads to greater value, efficiency, quality, and <span class="No-Break">customer alignment.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter serves as a practical guide for embarking on a VSM transformation journey. Before delving into the details, addressing some potential misconceptions is essential. VSM isn’t a novel concept nor merely a set of tools. Initially developed by Lean practitioners, VSM is a <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>methodology that employs value stream mapping concepts, analytics, and <strong class="bold">Kaizen </strong>(change for the better) planning. VSM’s goal is to identify and prioritize improvement opportunities, ultimately delivering maximum value to customers with the highest possible quality in the shortest sustainable <span class="No-Break">lead time..</span></p>
			<p>Embracing this continuous improvement process can distinguish you as a leader and innovator, propelling you toward operational excellence, increased profits, and enhanced <span class="No-Break">customer satisfaction.</span></p>
			<p>The topics covered in this chapter include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Laying the groundwork for value <span class="No-Break">stream mastery</span><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/></li>

			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Laying the groundwork for value stream mastery</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will introduce you to VSM principles and practices, which serve as a foundation for Lean-Agile improvements. VSM is a powerful methodology that extends beyond <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>software product development and delivery activities; its principles and practices are universally applicable to any workstream <span class="No-Break">or process.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, VSM plays a crucial role in aligning investments in software delivery capabilities with other corporate change initiatives, ensuring that priorities are aligned with corporate objectives and customer needs. We’ll explore how VSM serves as a continuous and less stressful business transformation strategy, discussing its purpose <span class="No-Break">and goals.</span></p>
			<p>VSM enables organizations to refine processes and adopt a Lean approach to eliminate inefficiencies such as constraints, delays, and waste, boosting value creation and competitiveness. Beyond the private sector, government agencies and not-for-profit organizations are challenged by the same forces of change that drive their commercial counterparts to accelerate their Lean-Agile transformations. The need for business (or mission) agility and the impact of digital disruption, globalization, ever-increasing cyber threats, aging legacy systems, and increasing dependency on technology are just a few of the factors equally concerning for government agencies and <span class="No-Break">private industries.</span></p>
			<p>At its core, VSM continually assesses value stream performance, prioritizing impactful enhancements <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>to expedite customer-centric deliveries, enhance quality, and reduce costs. Our <strong class="bold">nine-step VSM methodology</strong> operationalizes this approach, fostering continuous business evolution and sustain<a id="_idTextAnchor209"/><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>ing competitive advantage. Our unique approach to VSM incorporates Agile principles and practices to improve organizational flexibility, as discussed in the <span class="No-Break">following subsecti<a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>on.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Adopting Lean-Agile concepts</h2>
			<p>VSM, grounded in Lean principles, is a proven method for driving productivity through value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>mapping and Kaizen planning techniques, fostering relentless value-based improvements. Agile principles enhance VSM, expanding its effectiveness with cross-functional teams, collaboration, and accountability, as well as its iterative development and incremental <span class="No-Break">delivery approaches.</span></p>
			<p>In practice, VSM strategically refines processes to maximize value delivery and minimize waste, ensuring organizations maintain a customer-centric focus throughout the product life cycle. Additionally, VSM tools provide clear process snapshots, enhancing clarity and enabling <span class="No-Break">real-time analytics.</span></p>
			<p>Waste elimination is central to VSM, improving efficiency and enhancing workflow, quality, and cost- effectiveness. Additionally, addressing constraints that impede flow accelerates product deliveries and <span class="No-Break">removes waste.</span></p>
			<p>Guiding strategic decision-making, VSM places customer needs at the forefront. Aligned with customer requirements, VSM enhances net promoter scores, reflecting its commitment to customer centricity. Emphasizing continuous improvement, VSM advocates ongoing evaluation, fostering agility in response to evolving business requirements, market dynamics, and customer needs. Ultimately, VSM embodies a value-driven mindset that shapes organizational approaches for <span class="No-Break">sustained success.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Understanding the taxonomy of value streams</h2>
			<p>Organizing work <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>across value streams is essential for developing <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>product-centric workflows. <strong class="bold">Value Streams</strong> focus on streamlined operations, throughput maximization, constraint avoidance, and waste elimination. <strong class="bold">Processes</strong> within <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>value streams, such as product development, order entry, and sales, convert input into value-added output. <strong class="bold">Activities</strong> aggregate <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>information for <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>performance reporting, while <strong class="bold">Tasks</strong> define work and deliverables. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> illustrates the work taxonomy of value streams, which is vital for targeted improvements and <span class="No-Break">enhanced efficiency.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1 – Value stream work taxonomy</p>
			<p>This taxonomy <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>is fundamental for value stream analysis and optimization. <strong class="bold">Processes</strong> outline value creation flow, while <strong class="bold">Activities </strong>aid monitoring and decision-making. Mapping processes and activities identify inefficiencies, ensuring each step adds value. Establishing standard work practices at the <strong class="bold">Task</strong> level maintains consistent performance and quality. This understanding enables targeted improvements, enhancing efficiency <span class="No-Break">and effec<a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>tiveness.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you understand the foundational VSM groundwork, we will explore the strategic significance of VSM principles in driving organizational excellence and value delivery in the <span class="No-Break">following subsection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Applying VSM principles</h2>
			<p>VSM offers <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>deeper insights into the flows across interconnected value streams. Through a systematic approach, it pinpoints, prioritizes, and addresses the most consequential improvement opportunities, ensuring a comprehensive strategy for optimal <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></p>
			<p>The emphasis on maximizing value extends beyond the efficiency of isolated processes or value streams; it’s also about identifying and addressing flow constraints potentially hindering value delivery throughout a product’s <span class="No-Break">life cycle.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">The primary purpose of value streams</p>
			<p class="callout">Author Richard Knaster states, “<em class="italic">While value streams are critical aspects of Lean methods, it’s a common misconception that improved efficiency is their primary objective. That’s not surprising because eliminating waste is one of the most often discussed aspects of Lean. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Every value stream’s goal is to deliver the maximum value to the customer with the highest possible quality and delight in the shortest </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">sustainable lead-time</em></span><span class="No-Break">.”</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">1</span></span></p>
			<p>Drawing <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>from the foundational insights of Lean and Agile, the following set of guiding principles helps drive business outcomes in any <span class="No-Break">value-driven organization:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Holistic system optimization</strong>: Using systems thinking, end-to-end processes and activities are frequently assessed to create, improve, and deliver new customer value via products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer-centricity</strong>: Customers are the ultimate deciders of value for the solutions created and maintained by a portfolio’s value streams. Champion initiatives that align with the customer’s desires, needs, and priorities. Make customer experience a top priority throughout an organization’s actions <span class="No-Break">and attitude.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value</strong> <strong class="bold">stream</strong> <strong class="bold">insight</strong>: Map the end-to-end customer journey, revealing constraints and waste throughout the organization. Customer journey maps enhance understanding, improve user experiences, align teams, inform decisions, increase satisfaction, identify opportunities, optimize resources, and boost retention by proactively <span class="No-Break">addressing issues.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Demand-driven</strong>: Fine-tune your organizational processes to quickly respond to customer demand, optimize inventory, and deliver <span class="No-Break">high-quality value.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flow optimization</strong>: Concentrate on streamlining value delivery, tackling bottlenecks, delays, and <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>excess <strong class="bold">work in process </strong>(<strong class="bold">WIP</strong>) to minimize costly constraints and <span class="No-Break">accelerate throughput.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Waste</strong> <strong class="bold">elimination</strong>: Learn to see and address inefficiencies, both obvious and hidden, to cultivate a lean, <span class="No-Break">value-driven environment.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pursue perfection</strong>: Embrace the thinking of relentless improvement, advancing <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>toward optimal operations with retrospectives each iteration and inspect and adapt events for Agile teams <span class="No-Break">of teams.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organizational</strong> <strong class="bold">alignment</strong>: Foster respect and unity of purpose across all levels of the organization, ensuring a collective commitment to excellence in <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While these principles are foundational to VSM, their real power surfaces when implemented strategically to improve value delivery and time-to-market. However, we risk inefficient use of time and resources if we do not consider improvement opportunities in context with their overarching impact on the entire delivery system. In other words, we must avoid costly and ineffective <em class="italic">local optimizations</em> by employing <span class="No-Break">systems thinking.</span></p>
			<p>In the sections that follow, we’ll explore the challenges of local optimization—acting without systems thinking and <span class="No-Break">its effects.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>Optimizing value flow with VSM</h2>
			<p>VSM is a comprehensive method designed to enhance value-based organizational flows by identifying <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>and prioritizing improvements, eliminating waste, and overcoming constraints. Its core objective is to expedite customer value delivery by systematically addressing inefficiencies, improving quality, accelerating delivery, and reducing costs. This transformative approach relies on metrics and measures to gauge progress, foster continuous improvement, and enable data driven decision-making and <span class="No-Break">bottleneck i<a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>dentification.</span></p>
			<p>Before introducing our nine-step VSM methodology, we must first understand how to apply systems thinking to avoid <span class="No-Break">local optimizations.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Avoiding the pitfalls of local optimization</h2>
			<p>Local optimization occurs when organizations prioritize individual improvement opportunities <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>without considering the broader system. It often arises from undisciplined practices, where all items are treated equally in <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>resource allocation, or when executives allow individuals to dictate priorities without a <strong class="bold">systems thinking </strong>approach. Local optimization overlooks waste and constraints from a customer-oriented and value-added perspective, leading to unintended negative consequences on overall performance. In contrast, a systems thinking approach aims to optimize the system by understanding its interconnected parts and <span class="No-Break">feedback loops.</span></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, organizations often narrow their focus to improving individual departments or value stream activities, which may not yield significant improvements in the broader delivery process. For instance, a process improvement targeting increased throughput in a specific activity or equipment may not be beneficial if it’s not a constraint in our system. In such cases, resources are wasted, bottlenecks form, and excess WIP accumulates, hampering overall flow across the value stream. VSM practitioners emphasize a holistic evaluation of business processes to ensure alignment with customer aspirations and to avoid <span class="No-Break">misdirected efforts.</span></p>
			<p>Mapping the customer value stream, especially in siloed organizations, helps identify crucial streams for delivering value and reducing organizational waste. VSM emphasizes making organizational goals visible as value streams to foster alignment and reduce coordination costs. Now, let’s explore the E9 <span class="No-Break">VSM methodology.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>Defining the VSM process using the E9 methodology</h1>
			<p>VSM offers <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>a holistic method to visualize operations and enhance value delivery, prioritizing optimization of entire value streams to focus on customer value consistently. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> illustrates the <strong class="bold">E9 VSM process</strong>, providing a comprehensive approach to continuous value <span class="No-Break">st<a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>ream improvement.</span></p>
			<p>While E9 is presented linearly, the method operates like a network of activities occurring in parallel with feedback and iteration among steps. Additionally, an <strong class="bold">End </strong>state activity <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>considers the eventual retirement of a product and the importance of life cycle <span class="No-Break">management planning.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.2<a id="_idTextAnchor221"/> – E9 VSM process</p>
			<p>E9 is a mnemonic for the nine steps of our VSM im<a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>provement method: <strong class="bold">Embark,</strong> <strong class="bold">Educate</strong>, <strong class="bold">Envision</strong>, <strong class="bold">Examine</strong>, <strong class="bold">Evaluate</strong>, <strong class="bold">Engineer</strong>, <strong class="bold">Execute</strong>, <strong class="bold">Evolve</strong>, and <strong class="bold">End</strong>. Let’s look more closely at these nine VSM steps and their significance in contemporary <span class="No-Break">business practices.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Embark</strong>: Begin the VSM journey with commitment <span class="No-Break">and clarity.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Educate</strong>: Coach teams on Lean-Agile and <span class="No-Break">VSM principles.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Envision</strong>: Define the future state vision in alignment with <span class="No-Break">strategic goals.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Examine</strong>: Map current state value stream processes <span class="No-Break">and metrics.</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">End</strong>: Implement effective end-of-life support procedures for products <span class="No-Break">or services.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The E9 VSM method, while adapted to specific situations, has demonstrated its efficacy across various sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, sales, services, technology, and lean office settings, bolstering their global competitiveness since the early 2000s. Notable examples include the series of books on VSM by Don Tapping et <span class="No-Break">al. </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">5,6,7</span></span></p>
			<p>In an era <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>of digital innovation, the imperative to leverage technology for improving products, services, and processes can<a id="_idTextAnchor223"/><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>not <span class="No-Break">be overstated.</span></p>
			<p>With this groundwork laid, let’s explore the significance of value <span class="No-Break">stream optimization.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-124">1. Embark – be<a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>ginning the j<a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>ourney</h2>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.3, Embark</em>, is the first phase of the E9 VSM method and initiates the journey with a clear <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>commitment and purpose. It begins with securing leadership support and assembling the <span class="No-Break">VSM team.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.3 – Embark: beginning the journey</p>
			<p>The start of <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>a VSM initiative is not simply an icon representing a point in time on a VSM engagement roadmap. Instead, Embark represents a collection of activities necessary to identify the g<a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>oals and objectives that justify the time and resources expended on the effort, securing executive sponsorship, and identifying the VSM team that will guide the effort. These activities are described in the <span class="No-Break">following subsections.</span></p>
			<h3>Identifying the business justifications for VSM</h3>
			<p>Implementing a <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>VSM initiative can bring significant benefits to organizations. However, securing executive sponsorship and funding requires a well-constructed and defensible business case. While we can’t provide a specific business justification tailored to your organization, we have compiled a table of business reasons in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> to support a VSM initiative. It outlines why executives should consider sponsoring and <span class="No-Break">funding it.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Fi<a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>gure 4.4 – Table of business reasons to support a VSM initiative</p>
			<p>Demonstrating a strong <strong class="bold">return</strong> <strong class="bold">on</strong> <strong class="bold">investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>) and alignment with strategic priorities <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>enhances the chance of securing executive sponsorship and funding. You can start small and get started quicker if you take an incremental funding strategy, validate the benefits, and then move on to the next highest priority area. Keep the initial ask of executives small, build confidence and trust, and scale as needed, when appropriate. As Agile practitioners know, the best path forward is one of iterative and incremental change rather than a <span class="No-Break">big-bang approach.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve briefly explored the benefits of initiating a VSM program, let’s move on to securing leadership support and sponsorship for <span class="No-Break">your initiative.</span></p>
			<h3>Establishing leadership sup<a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>port and sponsorship</h3>
			<p>To convince executives to fund a VSM initiative, you will need to identify someone at the <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>executive level to sponsor and fund the initiative. It is usually necessary to gather supporting data, compile and present case studies, develop an implementation plan, and specify key areas <span class="No-Break">for improvement.</span></p>
			<p>VSM offers a strategic approach to managing change across organizations. Although Lean and Agile practitioners both champion continuous improvement, realizing this vision requires support, active engagement, and funding from senior executives. Convincing these leaders to invest in improvement requires a structured approach and a compel<a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>ling argument for the <span class="No-Break">initiative’s benefits.</span></p>
			<p>In the following subsections, we’ll explore strategies for gaining executive and <span class="No-Break">stakeholder support.</span></p>
			<h3>Aligning with strategic and operational objectives</h3>
			<p>To gain <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>the interest of executives, it’s best to align your VSM initiatives with the organization’s strategic objectives, as depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.5</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer036">
					<img alt="Figure 4.5 – Gaining executive sponsorship" src="image/B21818_04_5.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.5 – Gaining executive sponsorship</p>
			<p>Discuss how VSM can be a driving force behind achieving their critical goals. Executives are more likely to support initiatives that directly contribute to the bottom line. Also, identify the key stakeholders in your organization who influence the approval and support of <a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>your VSM initiatives. These individuals may include senior executives, department heads, influential managers, and other internal or <span class="No-Break">external stakeholders.</span></p>
			<h3>Communicating potential benefits and gaining support</h3>
			<p>Prepare <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>a persuasive pitch outlining VSM’s potential impact, customized to your organization’s needs, as discussed earlier. Employ data, metrics, and real-world case studies to demonstrate how VSM can bring about transformative change. Address the fundamental question executives are apt to pose: “What financial benefits does it <span class="No-Break">offer us?”</span></p>
			<p>Provide estimates of cost savings, revenue growth, or other financial benefits resulting from successful implementation. Executives are more inclined to support initiatives with a tangible ROI. However, when building your case, always be mindful of local optimizations, as they may prevent you from realizing <span class="No-Break">your ROI.</span></p>
			<p>Engage in focused discussions with key stakeholders to address their questions and concerns. Adapt your message to align with their needs, demonstrating a deep understanding of their concerns to strengthen <span class="No-Break">your case.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, internal advocates or champions who can promote the VSM initiative to executives <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>should be identified. These champions, influential figures within the organization, pass<a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>ionately believe in the benefits of VSM. Their trust and commitment can make a significant difference in gaining support for <span class="No-Break">the initiative.</span></p>
			<h3>Building trust and commitment</h3>
			<p>To secure sponsorship for a VSM initiative, involve peers in decision-making regarding people <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>and resources, schedules, and scope. Share customer success stories from organizations that have benefited from VSM. The <strong class="bold">Value Stream Management Consortium </strong>(<strong class="bold">VSMC</strong>) has many resources your <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>stakeholders and sponsors can read to gain additional information <span class="No-Break">and trust.</span></p>
			<p>Proposing a pilot program can effectively demonstrate the initiative’s effectiveness and alleviate concerns. Persistence and proactive risk management further garner executive support and funding. We can build upon these successes by starting VSM projects with a relatively small scope but high reward, targeting the organization’s early adopters. Eventually, as the benefits become evident and the processes become ingrained, even the laggards will come along and support future VSM programs. Ultimately, VSM becomes a way of life and an integral part of th<a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>e <span class="No-Break">organization’s culture.</span></p>
			<p>After gaining funding from your organization, it’s time to establish the VSM team to lead the effort described in the <span class="No-Break">following subsections.</span></p>
			<h3>Identifying the VSM team</h3>
			<p>The composition <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>of a VSM team can vary depending on factors such as organization size, industry, and objectives. However, specific key roles and characteristics are generally valuable for a successful <span class="No-Break">VSM initiative:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Executive</strong> <strong class="bold">sponsor</strong>: A senior leader who champions the VSM initiative, secures resources, and ensures alignment with <span class="No-Break">strategic goals</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">VSM leader/manager</strong>: Oversees the entire initiative, possessing expertise in Lean-Agile practices and business <span class="No-Break">process improvement</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value stream architect</strong>: Designs and aligns business strategy, processes, and capabilities to achieve objectives, interfacing between business and <span class="No-Break">IT stakeholders</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process</strong> <strong class="bold">owners</strong>: Manage specific value stream processes, implement changes, monitor performance, and recognize their role within a complex business <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>system that requires collaboration to achieve <span class="No-Break">shared goals</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data analysts</strong>: Gather, analyze, and interpret data related to the value stream’s performance, providing insights <span class="No-Break">for improvement</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cross-functional</strong> <strong class="bold">team</strong> <strong class="bold">members</strong>: Bring diverse expertise to address inefficiencies within the <span class="No-Break">value stream</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lean-Agile</strong> <strong class="bold">coach</strong>: Guides the team in applying Lean and Agile <span class="No-Break">principles effectively</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Change management specialist</strong>: Manages resistance to change and ensures the adoption of <span class="No-Break">new processes</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communication</strong> <strong class="bold">specialist</strong>: Facilitates effective communication <span class="No-Break">among stakeholders</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Not every organization can afford dedicated individuals for each role, so team members often take on multiple responsibilities. Additionally, the size and makeup of the VSM team can evolve as the initiative progresses across different product lines or value streams. Evolving the team requires considering specific industries, their unique requirements, and challenges. For example, expertise in production processes, supply chain management, robotics, automation, and quality control are essential <span class="No-Break">in manufacturing.</span></p>
			<p>After gaining <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>sponsorship, funding, and establishing teams, our V<a id="_idTextAnchor238"/><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>SM methodology progresses to education, communications, and change management—vital for overcoming resistance to change, described in the <span class="No-Break">following subsection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>2. Educate – Training, communicating, and managing change for success</h2>
			<p>In <em class="italic">VSM Step 2, </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.6 - Educate</em>, we address crucial components essential for the success <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>of your VSM initiative. Comprehensive training in <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>Lean-Agile and VSM principles is imperative to prepare individuals for the <span class="No-Break">upcoming changes.</span></p>
			<div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.6 - Educate: Training, communicating, and managing change for success</p>
			<p>However, education alone is insufficient. Effective communication is equally vital to convey the reasons behind the changes and their benefits, addressing stakeholders’ concerns o<a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>r fears. Additionally, change management practices are significant in managing resistance and ensuring a smoother transition as the organization <span class="No-Break">embraces VSM.</span></p>
			<h3>Educating teams on Lean-Agile and VSM principles</h3>
			<p>Educating <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>teams on Lean-Agile and VSM principles is vital <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>for success, fostering alignment and understanding across the organization. Start by introducing Lean-Agile’s key concepts, such as continuous improvement and customer-centricity. Similarly, familiarize teams with VSM’s principles, emphasizing end-to-end value <span class="No-Break">stream enhancement.</span></p>
			<p>As shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em>, business training sessions can be informal. Smaller training sessions are often preferable and more effective in engaging participants and <span class="No-Break">maintaining interest.</span></p>

			<p>These training <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>sessions provide a common language and mindset <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>and foster collaboration across functional boundaries. Let’s explore the scope of this training, beginning with <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile principles.</span></p>
			<h3>Teaching Lean-Agile principles and practices</h3>
			<p>Teaching Lean-Agile principles is essential for a successful VSM journey. Lean-Agile methodologies <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>prioritize adaptability, efficiency, and <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>customer focus, promoting continuous improvement by reducing waste and delivering <span class="No-Break">value promptly.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21818_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Implementing Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams (BLASTs)</em>, will describe how teams often switch between business-as-usual work and problem-solving activities. In other words, we’ll explore in depth how team members seamlessly transition between Lean and Agile modes <span class="No-Break">of working.</span></p>
			<p>But let’s quickly introduce the concepts here. Lean principles, including customer value, value stream mapping, and continuous improvement, are essential to sustain the efficient delivery of customer value through our products and services. In Agile, the focus is on <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>work item refinement, iterative planning, and incremental development cycles (also known as <strong class="bold">timeboxed</strong> <strong class="bold">d<a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>evelopment</strong> <strong class="bold">cycles</strong>). These practices foster collaboration and innovation, making organizations more responsive to customer needs. By understanding these principles, teams can effectively embrace VSM concepts <span class="No-Break">and practices.</span></p>
			<h3>Teaching VSM concepts</h3>
			<p>Teaching VSM concepts is essential for organizations aiming to enhance their end-to-end customer <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>value streams. As a core component of Lean-Agile methodologies, VSM focuses on efficiently delivering customer value. Corporate training should prioritize comprehensive education on the nine-step VSM methodology, covering <span class="No-Break">its nuances.</span></p>
			<p>While VSM builds upon foundational Lean concepts, training must extend beyond that. It should begin by defining the purpose of each VSM step and emphasize the importance of determining the idealized customer value stream as the organization’s guiding principle for <span class="No-Break">performance improvements.</span></p>
			<p>Training should focus on value stream mapping across the entire customer value stream to ensure a holistic approach and prevent local optimizations. Through gap analysis, participants can identify and prioritize impactful improvements, ranging from low-resource to higher-cost initiatives that requi<a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>re proposal submission <span class="No-Break">and approval.</span></p>
			<p>Ultimately, VSM training aims to equip teams with the knowledge and skills to effectively apply VSM principles, driving meaningful improvements in organizational <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<h4>Coaching strategies</h4>
			<p>Training and <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>coaching are essential to a successful VSM initiative, ensuring that VSM teams acquire the necessary skills and knowledge. Corporate VSM training programs should include immersive workshops, support for certifications, and hands-on experiential learning. These methods enable teams to deeply understand VSM principles and practices, enhancing their ability to visualize, analyze, and improve <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>However, knowledge alone isn’t sufficient; application is key. Coaching plays a vital role in this regard. Business coaching requires proficiency in active listening, empathy, and providing <span class="No-Break">constructive feedback.</span></p>
			<p>Effective questioning techniques encourage critical thinking and self-discovery among those coached. Coaches also guide individuals in creating actionable plans and hold them accountable for implementing desired changes. By continually refining coaching skills and fostering a collaborative atmosphere, coaches facilitate self-awareness, personal growth, and improv<a id="_idTextAnchor245"/><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>ed performance in a business setting. Training and coaching are <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>crucial for instilling VSM practices within an organization and driving meaningful change <span class="No-Break">and improvement.</span></p>
			<h4>Communicating for change</h4>
			<p>When implementing any program, project, or VSM initiative, it’s vital to have a well-defined <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>communication strategy in place. This strategy ensures that everyone involved, from employees to stakeholders, is fully informed and prepared for the changes ahead. To tailor your communication strategy effectively, consider the unique needs of your initiative and adapt accordingly. Remember, it’s often easier to refine an existing plan than to start <span class="No-Break">from scratch.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s take a quick look at the scope of work involved in supporting the <span class="No-Break">communications strategy.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define clear</strong> <strong class="bold">objectives</strong>: Establish specific goals for your <span class="No-Break">communication strategy.</span></li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.8 – Communications strategy</p>
			<p>By following <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>these steps, you can ensure that your communication efforts effectively convey the importance of the upcoming changes and engage your stakeholders throughout <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve covered the essentials of effective communication, let’s shift our focus to change management strategies. Change management is crucial for navigating the complexities of transformational efforts and maximizing the chances of achieving your <span class="No-Break">desired outcomes.</span></p>
			<h4>Implementing change management strategies and best practices</h4>
			<p>Change <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>management is crucial for guiding <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>organizations through transitions while minimizing disruption and resistance. Its goals include addressing concerns, maximizing adoption, reducing disruption, ensuring consistency, and optimizing <span class="No-Break">benefits realization.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s how to achieve these <span class="No-Break">goals effectively:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Addressing concerns</strong>: Identify and swiftly address employee concerns to minimize resistance and foster a supportive environment <span class="No-Break">for change</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Maximizing adoption</strong>: Ensure employees understand the reasons for change and actively participate in its implementation, fostering ownership <span class="No-Break">and commitment</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reducing disruption</strong>: Carefully plan and sequence changes to minimize disr<a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>uption to ongoing operations <span class="No-Break">and workflows</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ensuring consistency</strong>: Maintain consistency in communication and messaging to ensure all employees receive accurate and timely information about <span class="No-Break">the change</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Optimizing</strong> <strong class="bold">benefits</strong> <strong class="bold">realization</strong>: Focus on realizing the intended benefits of change quickly and effectively to achieve <span class="No-Break">organizational objectives</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Despite <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>well-structured communication and change management strategies, resistance to change may persist. Proactive <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>steps, including identifying sources of resistance and engaging with resistant individuals or groups, are essential to address concerns<a id="_idTextAnchor248"/> and foster alignment with <span class="No-Break">proposed changes.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s dive into the practical process of managing change within our <span class="No-Break">VSM initiative.</span></p>
			<h3>Managing change</h3>
			<p>Understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>key frameworks for change management is crucial for navigating organizational transitions effectively. Two fundamental proven change models are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">John Kotter’s eight-step process</strong>: Creating urgency is a critical first step to initiate change. Additional steps outlined in his seminal book Leading Change include building coalitions and vision, removing obstacles, creating short-term wins, building on the change, and anchoring the change in the new structure.<span class="superscript">2</span> This eight-step process calls for patience, especially in the first critical steps to achieve high engagement <span class="No-Break">from leaders.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hiatt’s</strong> <strong class="bold">ADKAR</strong> <strong class="bold">process</strong>: The Prosci ADKAR <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>five-step model by Jeff Hiatt advocates <strong class="bold">Awareness</strong>, <strong class="bold">Desire</strong>, <strong class="bold">Knowledge</strong>, <strong class="bold">Ability</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Reinforcement </strong>(<strong class="bold">ADKAR</strong>) through phases, preparation, design, implementation, <span class="No-Break">and sustainability.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These two change management frameworks provide a structured approach for ensuring smooth <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>transitions and maximizing the likelihood of successful outcomes. <a href="B21818_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor487"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Implementing Strategies for Organizational Transformation,</em> will discuss these two change management processes in further detail. Understanding them will serve as a foundation f<a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>or effective VSM change <span class="No-Break">management initiatives.</span></p>
			<p>The following subsection will cover stakeholder engagement, a critical component of successful change management in <span class="No-Break">VSM initiatives.</span></p>
			<h4>Engaging stakeholders in the VSM initiative</h4>
			<p>Stakeholder <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>engagement is crucial for the success of any VSM initiative. Stakeholders include employees, customers, suppliers, and others impacted by the initiative. To engage stakeholders effectively, you need to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify and map key stakeholders, considering their interests and <span class="No-Break">potential contributions</span></li>
				<li>Tailor communication to address the specific needs and priorities of each <span class="No-Break">stakeholder group</span></li>
				<li>Involve stakeholders early in planning and decision-<a id="_idTextAnchor250"/><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>making stages to foster ownership <span class="No-Break">and commitment</span></li>
				<li>Provide regular updates on progress, encourage feedback, and address <span class="No-Break">concerns openly</span></li>
				<li>Incorporate stakeholders’ input into change assessments for more <span class="No-Break">effective solutions</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Successful stakeholder engagement builds strong relationships, ensures alignment with initiative goals, and facilitates achieving desired outcomes. Next, we’ll explore the Envision step in the <span class="No-Break">VSM process.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>3. Envision – designing the ideal future state</h2>
			<p>Traditional VSM methodologies often advocate creating a current-state value stream map before <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>envisioning a future state. However, this approach can inadvertently reinforce existing inefficiencies. Instead, we propose envisioning the end-to-end <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>activities required to deliver a product or service to customers and support it across its life cycle. By doing this, the focus is on identifying the most efficient and effective delivery path possible, minimizing constraints and waste. This step is shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.9</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer040">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.9 - Envision: designing the ideal future state</p>
			<p>During this phase, avoid getting bogged down in detailed value stream mapping and performance metrics. The goal is to create an idealized value stream map free from unnecessary complexities <span class="No-Break">and inefficiencies.</span></p>
			<p>By prioritizing simplicity and efficiency from the outset, we can better identify opportunities for improvement and streamline the value delivery process, resulting in an idealized value <span class="No-Break">stream map.</span></p>
			<h3>Defining the idealized customer value stream</h3>
			<p>Defining the <strong class="bold">idealized customer value stream </strong>sets the compass for transformation. Start by <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>envisioning the perfect value stream—free of <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>constraints and waste. Engage your <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>team and stakeholders to imagine the optimal customer experience and how processes can deliver it consistently. Focusing on high-level ideals motivates your team and provides clear direction for the <span class="No-Break">improvement initiative.</span></p>
			<h3>Setting strategic goals and alignment</h3>
			<p>Strategic goals act as a North Star for transformative change. So, after crafting the idealized <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>value stream, aligning it with strategic objectives is the next step. Identify organizational goals, from enhancing efficiency to expanding market reach, and connect them with components of the ideal value stream. This alignment ties your VSM initiative to th<a id="_idTextAnchor253"/>e bigger picture, driving success <span class="No-Break">and transformation.</span></p>
			<h3>Creating a vision and mission for the value stream</h3>
			<p>Vision <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>and mission statements are essential for strategic planning. Working with executive sponsors, define a concise mission statement outlining specific objectives and methods for value stream optimization. Then, craft a vision statement that delves into the broader purpose of the VSM initiative, aligning it with the organization’s mission and values. These statements inspire teams and provide a shared sense <span class="No-Break">of purpose.</span></p>
			<h3>Establishing metrics and success criteria</h3>
			<p>Measuring <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>progress is integral to VSM. Establish metrics and success criteria as benchmarks after defining and aligning the ideal <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>value stream with strategic goals. Identify <strong class="bold">key performance indicators </strong>(<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>) tied to strategic objectives, such as lead time, cycle time, and customer satisfaction. Regularly review these KPIs to track progress and identify areas <span class="No-Break">for improvement.</span></p>
			<p>We can identify improvement opportunities and streamline the value delivery process by prioritizing simplicity and efficiency. This approach yields an idealized value stream map, laying the groundwork <span class="No-Break">for transformation.</span></p>
			<p>Hands-on knowledge of value stream mapping techniques is useful but not necessary to analyze the current and future states of the organization’s value streams and delivery capabilities. However, the overview we provided in Step 2 should give you the foundational knowledge to help you understand the key concepts. For those who want to understand the detailed mechanics of value stream mapping, author Cecil Rupp extensively discusses this topic in his previous book, Driving DevOps with Value Stream Management.<span class="superscript">3</span> Autho<a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>r Steve Pereira also guides readers through the practice in detail in his book Flow Engineering. The <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section also references several well-known books on this <span class="No-Break">topic. </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">4,5,6,7,8,9</span></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>4. Examine – assessing the current state and identifying inefficiencies</h2>
			<p>After designing the ideal state, the <a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>next step, <em class="italic">Examine</em> - identified in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.10</em>, involves <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>examining the current situation and thoroughly analyzing existing <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>processes and metrics. Through this work, we can diagnose inefficiencies and waste, paving the way for <span class="No-Break">strategic improvements.</span></p>

			<p>Here, you’ll discover the significance of current state mapping and explore tools and techniques for mapping value streams. Additionally, we cover methods for gathering process data and metrics to understand your <span class="No-Break">organization’s workflow.</span></p>
			<p>We will discuss conducting root cause analysis to uncover underlying issues and strategies for prioritizing areas for improvement. The following section p<a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>rovides the knowledge and tools to rigorously assess your organization’s current state, setting the stage for meaningful <span class="No-Break">VSM enhancements.</span></p>
			<h3>Examining current state processes and metrics</h3>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>value stream mapping process traditionally involves several key steps, depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.11</em>, which guide the examination and evaluation of <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer042">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.11 - Evaluate: assessing inefficiencies and waste with value stream mapping</p>
			<p>Value stream mapping is a lean improvement technique for management that defines and <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>illustrates the interconnected processes that bring a product or service from request to customer <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding how value streams create value for software development can be complex. The inefficiencies are not as highly visible as the ones you might see at a lean manufacturing plant. For example, a catwalk above the factory floor lets you observe the manufacturing value stream to see if the ‘line’ is slowing or grinding to <span class="No-Break">a halt.</span></p>
			<p>Value stream mapping is the equivalent of the catwalk for digital and knowledge-work-oriented value streams, although it is also useful for showing flow efficiency metrics in any type of value stream. It allows you to see the entire value flow and identify bottlenecks and delays. Nevertheless, inefficiencies have the same effects: increased waste and costs, decreased productivity, overburdened workers, uncertainties, and <span class="No-Break">lower quality.</span></p>
			<p>Mapping the value stream begins from product or service consumption and moves upstream, including supplier processes and material flows. Key activities supporting the customer experience are confirmed, while unnecessary ones are eliminated. Performance metrics are gathered for each process to establish baselines, and identify waste such as overproduction and defects <span class="No-Break">are identified.</span></p>
			<p>Following this, processes are analyzed to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies and develop improvement plans. A future state map is created to outline optimized processes. Implementation plans are formulated, support is obtained, and changes are <a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>executed. Continuous monitoring ensures performance aligns with expectations, with further improvement <span class="No-Break">opportunities identified.</span></p>
			<p>These steps provide a comprehensive assessment, laying the foundation for meaningful enhancements in VSM. They are commonly employed among Lean practitioners to bridge the gap between the current state and a desired future state. Notably, the value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>mapping process starts from delivery and moves upstream, a practice we will explore in the following subsection to understand <span class="No-Break">its rationale.</span></p>
			<h3>Exploring reverse value stream mapping – starting with the customer and working backward</h3>
			<p>Commencing the value stream mapping journey with the end—the customer—may appear <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>unconventional yet it is strategically sound. By mapping value streams, starting from the customer’s perspective, you can identify steps that add value and those that don’t. Moreover, this practice keeps the focus on defining the outputs that each preceding (upstream) step must deliver to support the current activity under investigation. This customer-centric approach ensures that value stream improvements directly benefit <span class="No-Break">end users.</span></p>
			<p>As we trace backward (upstream) through the value stream, scrutinizing each process, we naturally uncover inefficiencies and waste. This critical examination of activities allows us to refine processes akin to fine-tuning a <span class="No-Break">high-performance engine.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, this reverse approach to value stream mapping fosters a culture of continuous improvement, a cornerstone of Lean-Agile principles. By constantly seeking enhancements, we maintain an efficient, streamlined value s<a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>tream that consistently delivers exceptional <span class="No-Break">customer value.</span></p>
			<p>While unconventional, reverse value stream mapping ensures efficiency, quality, and better collaboration by considering both the product and customer <span class="No-Break">deli<a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>very flows.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>5. Evaluate – assessing inefficiencies and waste</h2>
			<p>As we <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>progress through the generic VSM methodology, we arrive at <em class="italic">VSM Step 5, Evaluate</em>, highlighted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.12</em>. This critical phase is pivotal in optimizing the value stream, aiming for enhanced efficiency, quality, and <span class="No-Break">customer satisfaction.</span></p>

			<h3>Assessing current state maps for inefficiencies</h3>
			<p>Before embarking on improvement initiatives, it’s essential to grasp the existing processes <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>thoroughly. Current state maps visually represent the value creation process across the value stream targeted for improvement. During this evaluation phase, we closely examine <span class="No-Break">these maps.</span></p>
			<p>This evaluation involves meticulously scrutinizing each step, input, and output within the value stream. Working backward, we question the necessity of each task, aiming to identify potential inefficiencies <span class="No-Break">and waste.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, we analyze whether preceding tasks are delivering requisite inputs or causing bottlenecks. We investigate potential excess or shortage of work and assess the quality of materials and <span class="No-Break">information provided.</span></p>
			<p>This detailed evaluation unveils the roo<a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>t causes of inefficiencies and waste within the value stream, laying the groundwork for targeted improvement initiatives. Such inefficiencies may manifest as unnecessary steps, delays, redundancies, <span class="No-Break">and overproduction.</span></p>
			<h3>Identifying bottlenecks and constraints</h3>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>learned in <a href="B21818_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Establishing Lean Flows to Improve Productivity</em>, the concept of waste in Lean encompasses eight categories of non-value-adding work. These traditional waste categories are <strong class="bold">Transportation</strong>, <strong class="bold">Inventory</strong>, <strong class="bold">Motion</strong>, <strong class="bold">Waiting</strong>, <strong class="bold">Overproduction</strong>, <strong class="bold">Overprocessing</strong>, <strong class="bold">Defects</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Underutilized Talent</strong>. We often find our bottlenecks and constraints originate from these eight waste categories. These bottlenecks impede workflow, causing delays, clutter, and <span class="No-Break">increased costs.</span></p>
			<p>Value stream mapping aims to uncover these bottlenecks and constraints, disrupting the smooth workflows. Identifying and res<a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>olving them becomes crucial to prioritize improvement efforts. Pinpointing specific process points where work accumulates enables <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>focused attention on alleviating these bottlenecks, ensuring a <span class="No-Break">balanced workflow.</span></p>
			<h3>Performing root cause analysis</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Root</strong> <strong class="bold">cause</strong> <strong class="bold">analysis</strong> offers problem-solving tools used to identify the actual causes of a <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>problem rather than just fixing the surface-level <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>symptoms. There is usually more than one cause of a problem, but the key is to avoid assumptions and logic traps, tracing the chain of causality from the effect to a root cause connected to the <span class="No-Break">original problem.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">five</strong> <strong class="bold">whys</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>proven problem-solving technique used to explore cause-and-effect relationships. Toyota developed and refined this process as a critical <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>component of its problem-solving training. Taiichi Ohno, recognized as the father of the <strong class="bold">Toyota Production System </strong>(<strong class="bold">TPS</strong>), explains the five whys technique in his book, <em class="italic">Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production</em>. He says, “<em class="italic">By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem, as well as its solution, becomes clear.</em>” <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.13</em> shows how this technique uncovers a problem’s <span class="No-Break">root cause.</span></p>

				<li><strong class="bold">Ask, “Why?”</strong>: Question why the problem occurred and note the <span class="No-Break">first answer.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Repeat</strong>: Continuously ask “Why?” for <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>each answer received, leading to more <span class="No-Break">specific causes.</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">Develop</strong> <strong class="bold">solutions</strong>: Brainstorm and implement solutions to eliminate or mitigate the identified <span class="No-Break">root causes.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Other <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>root cause analysis techniques, such as the <strong class="bold">Fishbone diagram </strong>(Ishikawa or cause-and-effect diagram), <strong class="bold">Failure Mod<a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>e and Effects Analysis </strong>(<strong class="bold">FMEA</strong>), and the <strong class="bold">Pareto analysis</strong>, are commonly used in <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>different situations and industries. The choice of technique depends on the complexity of the problem and the specific context in which <span class="No-Break">it occurs.</span></p>
			<h3>Prioritizing areas for improvement</h3>
			<p>Not all inefficiencies and bottlenecks within the value stream have equal impact. Hence, the final <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>step of the evaluation phase is prioritizing improvement areas. Considering factors such as severity, overall effect on the value stream, and resource requirements, we can develop a structured plan for addressing these inefficiencies. Recall that, as a general rule, we attack constraints first. But excessive cost and quality issues can also dictate higher priorities. Prioritization ensures that efforts and resources are directed where they will have the most significant <span class="No-Break">positive impact.</span></p>
			<p>In conclusion, the <em class="italic">Evaluate</em> phase is crucial for initiating meaningful improvements. By meticulously examining current state maps, identifying bottlenecks, performing root cause analysis, and prioritizing areas for enhancement, organizations can establish a foundation for a streamlined an<a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>d optimized value stream that efficiently delivers value <span class="No-Break">to customers.</span></p>
			<p>We are now ready to proceed to <em class="italic">Step 6, Engineer</em>, where we will focus on the strategic and tactical aspects of improvement and where planning and optimization take <span class="No-Break">center stage.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>6. Engineer – strategies and planning improvements</h2>
			<p>Having navigated through the initial phases of our VSM methodology, where we have identified <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>our areas for the most impactful improvements, we now transition from planning <span class="No-Break">to action.</span></p>
			<p>This subsection <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>will examine<a id="_idTextAnchor267"/> the essential aspects of engineering strategies and plans for improving your organization’s value stream. The process involves a systematic approach to identify, plan, and implement changes that enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and, ultimately, deliver more value to customers. The position of the Engineer step is highlighted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.14</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p>Given that VSM initiatives may uncover complex and potentially costly change opportunities navigating the company’s decision-making and funding processes is essential. Lean Kaizen planning (or road mapping) and forecasting are needed to justify investments, which must demonstrate a pragmatic ROI within a <span class="No-Break">predefined timeframe.</span></p>
			<p>In other words, designing superi<a id="_idTextAnchor268"/><a id="_idTextAnchor269"/>or products and processes alone won’t suffice if we fail to capture the market’s attention and needs within the critical window of opportunity. If we miss this window, our competitors will step in to fill the void, and our efforts will be <span class="No-Break">in vain.</span></p>
			<h3>Developing strategies and plans for desired improvements</h3>
			<p>Developing strategies and plans for improvements is essential for successful value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>optimization. This phase lays the groundwork for impactful transformations by identifying improvement areas, defining clear objectives, <a id="_idTextAnchor270"/>and establishing a precise direction. A well-structured plan guides your organization through the optimization journey and ensures the achievement of improvement goals. To navigate this process effectively, we’ve outlined suggested elements for your VSM change plan, as shown i<a id="_idTextAnchor271"/>n <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.15</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.15 – VSM change plan elements</p>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>evaluate the effectiveness and alignment of these planning elements with our goals, we adopt the <strong class="bold">SMART</strong> approach, as explored in the <span class="No-Break">following subsection.</span></p>
			<h3>Setting improvement objectives</h3>
			<p>Setting improvement objectives is the foundation of any value stream improvement effort. These <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>objectives should be <strong class="bold">SMART</strong>, an acronym for <strong class="bold">specific</strong>, <strong class="bold">measurable</strong>, <strong class="bold">achievable</strong>, <strong class="bold">relevant</strong>, and <strong class="bold">time-bound</strong>. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.16</em> details each improvement objective within the SMART acronym. A well-stated problem is essential to gaining a shared understanding of what needs to be achieved and serves as a benchmark to measure progress <span class="No-Break">and success.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer047">
					<img alt="Figure 4.16 – SMART improvement objectives" src="image/B21818_04_16.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.16 – SMART improvement objectives</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>VSM improvement plan should go beyond a text-based narrative, as it will be difficult for your reviewers to fully grasp ho<a id="_idTextAnchor272"/>w the proposed changes will affect the overall flows across your customer value streams. So, just as we did when documenting how work flows in our current value stream, we need to create a future state value stream map to show how work, information, and materials will flow in the <span class="No-Break">new environment.</span></p>
			<h3>Developing a future state value stream map</h3>
			<p>Developing a future state value stream map is crucial for visualizing the path to improvement. This map represents the ideal state of your value stream after implementing improvements. It serves as a blueprint for your <span class="No-Break">improvement efforts.</span></p>
			<p>A future <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>state value stream map differs from the previously discussed idealized value stream map. While the idealized map sets a target for improvement, the future state map focuses on what’s achievable within time and resource constraints. It specifies work, information, material f<a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>lows, and projected improvement measures resulting from <span class="No-Break">completed changes.</span></p>
			<p>The good news is that a future state value stream map closely resem<a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>bles the current state map. Since we’ve already covered the topic of value stream mapping in <a href="B21818_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Establishing Lean Flows to Improve Productivity</em>, we won’t revisit the process in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<h3>Identifying potential improvements and solutions</h3>
			<p>Identifying potential improvements and solutions involves a creative process of analyzing the current state of your value stream. Techniques such as value stream mapping <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>and root cause analysis help uncover optimization opportunities while brainstorming sessions and team collaboration generate innovative solutions for <span class="No-Break">identified issues.</span></p>
			<p>However, we often face financial and resource constraints when implementing all identified improvements, particularly in larger value streams. Therefore, it’s crucial to assess the <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>impact of the proposed changes on our ability to deliver value to customers profitably. The <strong class="bold">Theory of Constraints </strong>helps prioritize opportunities by focusing on anything disrupting workflow, especially those hindering us from achieving our <strong class="bold">TAKT </strong>time—a customer-centric metric representing the pace that meets customer demand given <span class="No-Break">available capacity.</span></p>
			<p>Tooling, equipment, materials, training, and information access improvements can reduce costs, enhance quality, and improve customer satisfaction. Balancing these factors maximizes value delivery through our products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<p>Given a <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>choice between fi<a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>xing constraints or eliminating costly waste with a set budget, how would you decide? In his book <em class="italic">Principles of Product Development Flow</em>, Don Reinertsen describes an economic model for prioritizing jobs called <strong class="bold">Weighted Shortest Job First </strong>(<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">WSJF</strong></span><span class="No-Break">). </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">10</span></span></p>
			<h3>Determining improvement priorities using WSJF</h3>
			<p>WSJF has <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>been p<a id="_idTextAnchor276"/>opularized in Lean-Agile frameworks such as the <strong class="bold">Scaled</strong> <strong class="bold">Agile</strong> <strong class="bold">Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>®) to determine priorities. Applying <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>WSJF ensures funding is allocated to deliver the most value in the shortest duration, providing the best <span class="No-Break">economic return.</span></p>
			<p>WSJF is <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>estimated as the <em class="italic">relative</em> <strong class="bold">cost of delay </strong>(<strong class="bold">CoD</strong>) divided by the relative job duration. Using a modified Fibonacci sequence for the relative numbers (1,2,3,5,8,13,20) instead of money simplifies the calculation and avoids a false sense of accuracy. Most Agile practitioners know how to use relative estimation, which is another benefit. Job size offers a good proxy for the duration since it can be hard to determine how long an improvement item or feature will take <span class="No-Break">to implement.</span></p>
			<p>The CoD represents the money lost by delaying or not doing a job for a specific time. CoD consists of three parameters: user-business value, time criticality, and risk reduction/opportunity enablement. Dividing the CoD by the job size yields the WSJF. Jobs with the highest WSJF are the most important ones to do. WSJF conveniently ignores sunk costs, a fundamental principle of <span class="No-Break">Lean economics.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.17</em> provides a table and guidelines for <span class="No-Break">calculating<a id="_idTextAnchor277"/> WSJF.</span></p>

			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>following subsection, we’ll outline the typical components of a Kaizen (<span class="No-Break">change) plan.</span></p>
			<h3>Planning continuous improvements</h3>
			<p>Implementing a Kanban system that tracks the proposed improvements with the highest WSJF is <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>a good practice. <strong class="bold">Kaizen </strong>is a Japanese <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>term that roughly translates to change for the better, underscoring a culture of <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement.</span></p>
			<p>A Kaizen plan, central to the philosophy of continuous improvement, should contain the following key components to ensure structured, actionable progress toward steady <span class="No-Break">incremental enhancements:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Objective</strong>: Clearly define specific, measurable goals for process improvement, waste reduction, and <span class="No-Break">productivity enhancements</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scope and timeline</strong>: Detail the initiative’s scope, covering relevant processes or areas, and establish a realistic implementation timeline considering the <span class="No-Break">project’s complexity</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team composition</strong>: Form a cross-functional team representing all relevant departments involved in the <span class="No-Break">improvement processes</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Current state analysis</strong>: Conduct a thorough analysis, including data collection, workflow mapping, and identifying bottlenecks <span class="No-Break">or inefficiencies</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Root cause analysis</strong>: Using techniques such as the five whys or fishbone diagrams to identify root causes is crucial for developing <span class="No-Break">effective solutions</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Solution development and planning</strong>: Brainstorm and select solutions, developing an action plan with assigned responsibilities <span class="No-Break">and resources</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Budgeting</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">approvals</strong>: Establish a clear budget and approval process, aligning with organizational fiscal strategies and securing approvals from <span class="No-Break">key stakeholders</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implementation and monitoring</strong>: Execute the action plan, closely monitoring adherence to the timeline and <span class="No-Break">solution effectiveness</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Review and standardization</strong>: Evaluate outcomes against objectives, standardize successful practices, and document lessons learned for <span class="No-Break">future reference</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement cycle</strong>: Establish a cycle for regular process review and identification of further enhancements <span class="No-Break">for implementation</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A well-structured <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>Kaizen plan nurtures a culture of continuous enhancement, driving long-term <span class="No-Break">operational excellence.</span></p>
			<p>When approaching continuous improvement, it’s important to distinguish between Scrum <strong class="bold">retrospective </strong>practices and Kaizen plans. Scrum focuses on small, rapid, incremental changes during sprint retrospectives, while Kaizen planning excels in scaling larger, more complex changes for teams of agile teams. Kaizen planning offers a comprehensive <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>evaluation and structured approval process, aligning well with <strong class="bold">Lean</strong> <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> <strong class="bold">Management </strong>(<strong class="bold">LPM</strong>) strategies to prioritize and execute <span class="No-Break">large-scale investments.</span></p>
			<p>Onc<a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>e the roadmap is set, we transition into <em class="italic">Step 7, Execute</em>, where the Kaizen plans are implemented, marking the tangible realization of our vision for an optimized value stream. Let’s delve into these critical stages, where transformation shifts from ideation to implementation, driving real and impactful change across the <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/>7. Execute – implementing changes and adjusting</h2>
			<p>All our work <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>so far is meaningless if we don’t successfully execute the plans we’ve developed. This is where action speaks louder than words. Here, we explore the practical <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>steps in implementing changes within your organization, ensuring that your improvement initiatives align with your goals and drive positive outcomes. Shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.18</em>, here we Execute our plan to bring it <span class="No-Break">to reality.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.18 - Execute: implementing changes and adjusting</p>
			<p>Not everything will work according to our plans. So, we emphasize the importance of adaptability, enabling you<a id="_idTextAnchor280"/> to adjust your plan as needed to ensure the successful execution of your improvement initiatives. This section equips you with the knowledge and tools to engineer and execute value stream improvements that drive your organization toward enhanced efficiency and <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></p>
			<h3>Implementing changes and the improvement plan</h3>
			<p>Your <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>well-crafted improvement plan serves as your roadmap, outlining the path to your organization’s enhanced effici<a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>ency and value delivery. Effective implementation starts with a detailed understanding of your plan. Ensure your team comprehends the objectives, milestones, and specific actions required. While leveraging Agile’s self-organizing and cross-functional concepts, the VSM team self-assigns their work. However, the VSM team lead, typically in the Value Manager role, should regularly review the plan to ensure alignment and encourage adjustments <span class="No-Break">as necessary.</span></p>
			<h3>Monitoring progress and performance</h3>
			<p>Monito<a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>ring progress and performance is crucial to keeping improvement initiatives on course. Your <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>plan should include documented goals in the form of metrics and KPIs that align with your objectives. Regularly measure progress against these metrics. Transparent reporting and communication of progress can keep stakeholders engaged and informed, fosterin<a id="_idTextAnchor283"/>g a culture of accountability and <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement.</span></p>
			<h3>Handling resistance to change</h3>
			<p>Thoughtfully managing change is required, given the scope and potential impacts of improvements <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>on how the organization operates and how people work. Resistance to change is natural but can be addressed effectively. Listen to concerns, empathize, communicate the rationale behind changes, and create a safe space for open dialogue. By acknowledging and addressing resistance, you can steer toward <span class="No-Break">success better.</span></p>
			<h3>Navigating the Agile transition</h3>
			<p>Navigating <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>the complexities of an Agile transition involves more than simply choosing a methodology; it requires careful consideration of several critical aspects that are frequently overlooked or poorly implemented. These include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rate</strong> <strong class="bold">of</strong> <strong class="bold">adoption:</strong> Assess the extent of change you introduce at once. An overwhelming rate can hinder the <span class="No-Break">transition process.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Depth</strong> <strong class="bold">of</strong> <strong class="bold">adoption</strong>: Determine the depth to which you integrate Lean-Agile practices. Surface-level adoption may not yield the <span class="No-Break">desired transformation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scope</strong> <strong class="bold">of</strong> <strong class="bold">adoption</strong>: Evaluate the breadth of Lean-Agile practices and principles you apply. Covering a broad scope without prioritization can dilute the focus <span class="No-Break">and impact.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fit for purpose</strong>: Tailor the Lean-Agile approach to align with the team’s skills and organizational culture. A one-size-fits-all method often fails <span class="No-Break">to resonate.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Support</strong> <strong class="bold">for</strong> <strong class="bold">new</strong> <strong class="bold">adopters</strong>: Provide comprehensive support ma<a id="_idTextAnchor284"/>terials to facilitate the learning curve for individuals new to Lean and <span class="No-Break">Agile practices.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Failure to <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>address these aspects adequately can lead to resistance, decreased effectiveness, and a greater need for motivation to <span class="No-Break">achieve success.</span></p>
			<h3>Adjusting the Kaizen plan as needed</h3>
			<p>The Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, “Change is the only constant in life.” Despite good planning, unexpected challenges will likely occur. Consequently, having a bias for action <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>and adjusting your plan is crucial, as flexibility is essential. Continuously review your initiatives, gather feedback, and incorporate lessons learned to ensure steady progress toward <span class="No-Break">your goals.</span></p>
			<p>As we work our way through the execution phase, our value stream improvement visions takes form. We propel our organization toward greater efficiency and value delivery by implementing our plan, monitoring progress, addressing resistance, and <span class="No-Break">remaining adaptable.</span></p>
			<p>Remember, execution is the bridge that transforms strategy into tangible results. Nevertheless, our business world will continue to evolve. In the next section, we’ll explore the iterative process of continuously refining our value <span class="No-Break">stream activities.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/>8. Evolve – evolving through refinement of value stream activities</h2>
			<p>In the <em class="italic">Evolve</em> phase (<span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.19</em>), we focus on regularly evaluating and refining value streams <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>to maintain efficiency and effectiveness. This section discusses <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>sustaining improvements and ensuring alignment with evolving <span class="No-Break">organizational goals.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer050">
					<img alt="Figure 4.19 - Evolve: evolving through refinement of value stream activities" src="image/Figure_4.19_B21818.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.19 - Evolve: evolving through refinement of value stream activities</p>
			<h3>Continuously evaluating the value stream</h3>
			<p>Continuous evaluation is essential for the evolution of processes within the value stream. It involves regular assessment of each component’s contribution to overall goals and identifying <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>bottlenecks or waste that may have emerged over time. Organizations can proactively adjust by leveraging real-time data analytics and performance metrics to prevent minor issues from escalating into <span class="No-Break">significant problems.</span></p>
			<p>Modern VSM platforms supporting software development life cycles have embraced this concept. Once connected, these platforms provide end-to-end and real-time visibility, metrics, and analytics spanning all activities and tools supporting the development, testing, delivery, and support of the organization’s <span class="No-Break">software applications.</span></p>
			<p>This <a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>proactive approach ensures that value streams maintain efficiency and effectiveness over time while remaining aligned with the organization’s evolving goals. We must continually explore strategies to remain Agile in adapting to shifting business landscapes and changing customer expectations, all while optimizing efficiency and <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></p>
			<h3>Gathering feedback from stakeholders</h3>
			<p>If digital tooling is involved, all value stream improvement initiatives require feedback from team <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>members, stakeholders, and customers. Feedback from customers and employees who engage with the daily processes should guide <span class="No-Break">process improvement.</span></p>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/>Structured feedback mechanisms, such as surveys, focus groups, and feedback loops, can provide invaluable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the value streams. This information is critical for identifying areas that require attention and can also highlight opportunities for innovation. But none of it matters if we don’t also analyze the data <span class="No-Break">and act.</span></p>
			<h3>Iteratively improving processes</h3>
			<p>The core <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>of process evolution lies in iteration, implementing incremental changes over continuous cycles that drive significant enhancements over time. While some improvements may demand substantial resources, organizations often have opportunities to make smaller, more manageable changes. These can be swiftly evaluated and implemented, fostering a culture of rapid adaptation and efficiency. However, always be mindful to manage flows through pull-oriented control systems, such as Kanban, lest you create bottlenecks and other forms <span class="No-Break">of waste.</span></p>
			<p>It is important to recall our previous discussion on local optimization. Also, if a proposed change takes time, resources, and funding beyond the team’s authority, it should be considered by the enterprise’s portfolio <span class="No-Break">management function.</span></p>
			<p>In Agile practices at the team level, iterative cycles and incremental improvements are distinct yet <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>complementary. Iterative cycles involve regular repetition of a development process, allowing quick responsiveness to change. Incremental improveme<a id="_idTextAnchor288"/>nts are tangible advancements made at the end of each iteration, gradually building the <span class="No-Break">complete product.</span></p>
			<p>Although our focus has been on VSM initiatives, the concepts of iterative and incremental development  from Agile methodologies  are crucial in the Evolve step, ensuring ongoing improvements for sustaining our business’s competitiveness <span class="No-Break">and adaptability.</span></p>
			<h3>Sustaining improvements over time</h3>
			<p>Sustainability ensures that improvements endure, preventing the business from deteriorating <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>amidst changing market dynamics and customer preferences. Establishing a culture of continuous improvement empowers every team member to identify and implement enhancements to their <span class="No-Break">work processes.</span></p>
			<p>Standardizing successful improvements and integrating them into the typical workflow ensures their incorporation into the organizational fabric, enhancing long-term efficiency and value delivery. Standardization is a fundamental concept in Lean, and without mechanisms to support these standards, improvements may rapidly degrade while individuals revert to old habits or less <span class="No-Break">efficient practices.</span></p>
			<p>In conclusion, the Evolve step in VSM fosters a culture of continuous improvement within the organization. Its systematic approach of regular evaluation, feedback, iteration, and sustaining improvements ensures that value streams remain resilient, responsive, and strategically aligned. This evolutionary process enables organizations to stay <a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>agile and competitive in delivering <span class="No-Break">customer value.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we will delve into <em class="italic">VSM Step 9, End</em>, focusing on a product or service’s retirement <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">end-of-life</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>9. End – retiring a product</h2>
			<p>We’ve reached <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>the final stage of our VSM methodology. As depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.20</em>, here, our focus shifts to the critical aspect of concluding a product’s life cycle, a phase as <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>crucial as any other and demanding <span class="No-Break">careful attention.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer051">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.20 - End: retiring a product</p>
			<p>In this section, we will guide you through the primary steps of recognizing when a product or se<a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>rvice has reached its end-of-life (EOL), planning for the conclusion of its value stream, managing the retirement of products and services, and ensuring customer satisfaction. This section aims to help you navigate this phase strategically, balancing operational considerations with <span class="No-Break">customer-centric practices.</span></p>
			<h3>Recognizing when a product or service has reached its EOL</h3>
			<p>Identifying when a product or service has reached its EOL is vital for effective VSM. This awareness <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>hinges on declining sales, rising maintenance costs, market shifts, technology obsolescence, and other sustainability factors. Proactively identifying these factors enables strategic planning for product phase-out rather than reactive responses to <span class="No-Break">market pressures.</span></p>
			<p>A balanced approach is essential for monitoring and interpreting these signals effectively, as in <span class="No-Break">this example:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Analyzing</strong> <strong class="bold">quantitative</strong> <strong class="bold">data</strong>: Regular assessment of sales figures, profit margins, maintenance costs, technical debt, and customer satisfaction through data analytics reveals declining trends and increased costs, signaling the EOL of <span class="No-Break">a product</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Observing market evolution</strong>: Tracking industry trends, technological advancements, and competitor actions often provides good insight into market shifts that could render a <span class="No-Break">product obsolete</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gathering and analyzing customer feedback</strong>: Collecting feedback through customer surveys, focus groups, and social media helps identify satisfaction <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>and usability issues, offering objective data into declining sales or customer <span class="No-Break">retention challenges</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Competitive analysis</strong>: Regularly reviewing competitors’ offerings and strategies provides perspective on your product’s market position and reveals whether continued investment in your produc<a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>t <span class="No-Break">is warranted</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These strategies underscore the comprehensive nature of Lean-Agile and VSM practices, highlighting the need for organization-wide involvement. They emphasize that managing value streams requires diligent oversight from inception to EOL, without shortcuts in effectively managing <span class="No-Break">each stage.</span></p>
			<h3>Planning for the conclusion of the value stream</h3>
			<p>Once the <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>EOL of a product is acknowledged, the next step is to plan for the orderly retirement of its value stream. This decommissioning involves <span class="No-Break">several activities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Discuss</strong> <strong class="bold">the</strong> <strong class="bold">proposal</strong> <strong class="bold">to</strong> <strong class="bold">EOL</strong> <strong class="bold">with</strong> <strong class="bold">stakeholders</strong>: Retiring a product is a strategic decision that may affect many other departments, including sales, marketing, legal, finance, customer success, and human resources. It should involve key stakeholders of your organization, particularly your executive staff and, in some cases, the board of directors, partners, and <span class="No-Break">key customers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Develop an EOL product roadmap</strong>: You can create a roadmap to strategically think through and map out your plan for taking your product through the EOL process, including a plan for a replacement product or service. Don't forget to address data security, environmental, and other disposal issues associated with eliminating <span class="No-Break">old products.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Getting approval for your EOL plan</strong>: Once you’ve built a business case based on evidence, you can take your data-supported proposal to sunset your product to your <span class="No-Break">executive stakeholders.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communicate your EOL plan</strong>: Discuss how the product’s end-of-life will affect sales and marketing materials and customer presentations, and help these groups identify alternative solutions to steer prospects toward in <span class="No-Break">the futur<a id="_idTextAnchor293"/><a id="_idTextAnchor294"/>e.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reallocate</strong> <strong class="bold">people</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">resources</strong>: Now that you have a plan to sunset your product <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>or service, you can start preparing how to redeploy the people, resources, and budget that has been freed up. Handled properly, you’ll find you have extra capacity to make newer products or services <span class="No-Break">more successful.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Documenting lessons learned and best practices</strong>: The final phase of a product’s life cycle (EOL) presents a valuable opportunity for reflection and learning. This retrospective typically involves documenting lessons learned and best practices, getting input from cross-functional teams across the enterprise, conducting retrospectives, and turning the documentation into a dynamic knowledge base to share across the organization and incorporate into <span class="No-Break">future endeavors.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>Adopting a VSM platform</h1>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">VSM platform </strong>(<strong class="bold">VSMP</strong>) is essential for optimizing end-to-end software product deliveries <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>and improving business outcomes and IT operations. In DevOps environments, a VSMP supports process integration and automation while providing analytics for data-driven decision-making. It helps enable a customer-centric approach, prioritizing features that improve the customer experience while fostering team alignment <span class="No-Break">and collaboration.</span></p>

These solutions leverage graphical representations, data analytics, and artificial intelligence to enhance decision-making <span class="No-Break">and effectiveness.</span></p>
			<p>Organizations may need to adapt existing tools, systems, and applications to effectively capture, visualize, and analyze value stream flows. Integration of technology enhances VSMP’s effectiveness, providing powerful tools <span class="No-Break">for optimization.</span></p>
			<p>VSMPs connect to <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>your existing software development, testing, and support tools and import data from all phases of software product delivery, from concept to value delivery. They help software engineering leaders identify and quantify opportunities to improve software product performance by optimizing cost, operating <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>models, technology, and processes. Modern VSMPs use <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence </strong>(<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">machine learning </strong>(<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) powered analytics, providing <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>automated insights to identify constraints, diagnose bottlenecks, and <span class="No-Break">improve flow.</span></p>
			<p>The primary <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>components of a VSMP include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Visualization and mapping</strong>: Visualize and map value streams to clearly <span class="No-Break">understand workflow</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Analytics</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">reporting</strong>: Collect and analyze data for insights into performance and generate <span class="No-Break">customizable reports</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration and collaboration</strong>: Seamlessly connect with other tools and systems to enable data and workflow synchronization and facilitate <span class="No-Break">team collaboration</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Workflow</strong> <strong class="bold">automation</strong>: Streamline processes by automating tasks and <span class="No-Break">improving efficiency</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous</strong> <strong class="bold">improvement</strong>: Implement feedback mechanisms for <span class="No-Break">ongoing improvement</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customization</strong> <strong class="bold">and flexibility</strong>: Adapt to unique organizational needs and <span class="No-Break">changing requirements</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next chapter, you’ll build on the foundation by mastering the VSM implementation roadmap. You’ll understand how VSM, when applied consistently and strategically, becomes an integral part of your organization’s DNA, fostering a culture of perpetual improvement. You’ll learn how to identi<a id="_idTextAnchor296"/>fy and prioritize value streams, envision ideal states, and execute effective strategies within a framework that evolves and adapts <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>over time. By embracing the continuous improvement of VSM, you’ll position yourself and your organization to excel in today’s dynamic business environment, setting you apart as a leader and innovator in the pursuit of <span class="No-Break">operational excellence.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>Summary</h1>
