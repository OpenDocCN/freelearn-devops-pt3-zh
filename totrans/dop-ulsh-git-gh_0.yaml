    This is embarrassing*”? Even if it wasn’t really embarrassing, did it cause you
    to feel a little low or nervous?

    whenever possible.

- en: The good news? The more you fail, the more you learn. There’s no such thing
    as learning without failure. Now, for some bad news. Git and GitHub, which you
    will learn about, are fundamentally systems designed to record changes. They are
    not built to easily hide your mistakes. In some circles, being proficient with
    Git is taken for granted, and not being able to use GitHub can even call into
    question your qualifications as an engineer. What’s worse, mistakes in automated
    DevOps pipelines can directly lead to production failures. A minor slip-up could
    be the gateway to much bigger errors. In a technological ecosystem that thrives
    on collaboration and rapid development, these tools and methodologies underpin
    modern engineering practices. Your desire for a comprehensive understanding of
    Git, GitHub, and DevOps is well-placed.

    in development teams to communicate effectively within their teams, teaching the
    fundamentals of modern team development to continually refine your products. Ultimately,
    it’s a book that will significantly enhance your developer experience.

- en: But let’s be clear, perfection is a myth. However, excellence is undoubtedly
    achievable. In that way, this is not only a book about avoiding mistakes but also
    about embracing them and establishing a process, workflow, and culture that permits
    errors. It’s about understanding how to react, adapt, and grow when they inevitably
    happen. This is the essence of a thriving DevOps culture.

    with your team openly about them, and to find collective solutions. Every mistake
    you make and learn from brings you one step closer to becoming not just a competent
    engineer but also an invaluable team player.
