    emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to streamline
    the software development life cycle. It involves automating the entire software
    delivery process, from code development to deployment and maintenance. One area
    where DevOps has had a particularly significant impact is database management
    practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In traditional software development, database management was often seen as a
    separate task from the rest of the development process. DBAs would typically work
    in isolation from the development team, making it difficult to ensure that the
    database met the needs of the application. This siloed approach often resulted
    in delays and errors, as changes to the database schema were not always properly
    communicated to the development team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DevOps has changed this approach by promoting collaboration and communication
    between development and operations teams. By bringing DBAs into the development
    process earlier, DevOps teams can ensure that the database is designed to meet
    the needs of the application from the outset. This helps to reduce the risk of
    errors and delays later in the development process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the key ways that DevOps has improved database management practices is
    through the use of automation. In traditional software development, many tasks
    related to database management were performed manually. This was a time-consuming
    process that was prone to errors. DevOps teams have automated many of these tasks,
    making the process faster and more reliable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, DevOps teams can use automated scripts to generate database schema
    changes. These scripts can be version-controlled, which helps to ensure that changes
    are made in a consistent and repeatable way. This makes it easier to track changes
    to the database over time and roll back changes if necessary.
