			<p><st c="8">Hey, welcome to </st><em class="italic"><st c="25">Platform Engineering for Architects</st></em><st c="60">! Platform engineering is the practice of creating environments that can build, test, validate, deploy, and operate software in a secure and cost-efficient way. </st><st c="221">Platform engineering is about automation, and about enabling the platform’s users, developers, and operations to focus on value creation. </st><st c="359">A platform, often defined as an </st><strong class="bold"><st c="391">Internal Development Platform</st></strong><st c="420"> or </st><strong class="bold"><st c="424">Internal Developer Portal</st></strong><st c="449"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="451">IDP</st></strong><st c="454">), abstracts away the complexity of the underlying infrastructure and all the moving components required to support the software life cycle from its setup until it goes live in production. </st><st c="644">But platform engineering is more than just technologies that have to play well together. </st><st c="733">It requires an open mindset and a holistic approach to define the purpose of the platform, along with following principles in the decision-making process and fostering a culture of change </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="921">and innovation.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="936">In </st><em class="italic"><st c="940">Platform Engineering for Architects</st></em><st c="975">, we will engage you in building up a product mindset to build a solution that ages and matures with time but stays young at heart. </st><st c="1107">Step by step, we will create our strategic direction and define our target architecture for the platform. </st><st c="1213">This will become a living artifact for you and everyone working with you. </st><st c="1287">Throughout the book, we will cover the four different pillars of a platform and the relevant decisions you have to take: the infrastructure representation by Kubernetes, the automation, the self-service capabilities, and the built-in observability and security. </st><st c="1549">By the end, you will be equipped with tools to handle costs including actual infrastructure costs and technical debts. </st><st c="1668">If both are managed well, they can even become your best allies in overcoming organizational obstacles </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1771">and politics.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="1784">For every aspect and topic we write about in this book, we also provide additional sources that cover full technical details. </st><st c="1911">Our goal is to provide you with a framework of references and an approach for defining platform architectures that can mature over time without being tied to a specific technology or version. </st><st c="2103">We are well aware that the only constant in life is change, and this holds true for platform engineering. </st><st c="2209">That’s why we also encourage you as a platform engineer and architect to keep up to date with those changes and bring the product mindset to your users </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2361">and stakeholders.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/><st c="2378">Who this book is for</st></h1>
			<p><st c="2399">The book is for platform engineers and architects, DevOps engineers, and cloud architects who want to transform their way of implementing cloud-native platforms to use a platform as </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2582">a product.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="2592">This book is also for IT leaders, decision-makers, and IT strategists who are searching for new approaches to improve their systems landscape and software delivery, covered by a holistic approach that goes beyond the simple “</st><em class="italic"><st c="2818">you built it, you </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="2837">run it</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="2843">.”</st></span></p>
