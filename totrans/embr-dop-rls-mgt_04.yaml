- en: A conventional IT organization has extremely long development cycles by today’s
    standards. In these antiquated companies, capacious amounts of manual testing
    must usually occur prior to a software product being released to production. What’s
    more, any time there’s a code change, it can cause a remarkable amount of stress
    on the stakeholders involved. While working in organizations such as these, development
    teams typically wait for clean environments to be provisioned or they must wait
    for approval prior to making any changes at all. Additionally, **quality assurance**
    (**QA**) teams might be waiting for developers to finish their work before it
    is ready for testing. All of this waiting results in low **deployment frequency**
    (**DF**) and high **lead time for** **changes** (**LTFC**).

    a project is finished, leaving little documentation behind and zero knowledge
    transfer. This makes things challenging when new engineers join the team and attempt
    to support the systems. Usually, this leads to a higher **mean time to recovery**
    (**MTTR**) when critical issues occur. Many organizations such as these manage
    the configuration of their environments with a dedicated operations team, whose
    sole focus is on infrastructure. They will commonly pursue manual changes to their
    servers, resulting in configuration drift, even if **Infrastructure-as-Code**
    (**IaC**) is the standard company procedure. Servers across environments may end
    up with different artifacts, such as required libraries needed for applications
    or different patch levels of the same product. All of this manual work results
    in low DF, with high lead times.

    has been a founding feature of DevOps from its very inception. This includes proactively
    monitoring the production environment for potential issues that would negatively
    impact users if left unchecked. The reality is that contemporary applications
    rely on numerous artifacts and services with multiple points of failure. In addition
    to using static and dynamic application analysis tools in pipelines, it is pertinent
    that you perform transactional monitoring in all development environments, not
    just production. Do this by running tests with mock data and continuous monitoring;
    this way, you can detect issues that affect any component of your application,
    including third-party **Software-as-a-Service** (**SaaS**) integrations. Some
    effective SaaS tools that facilitate this include Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic,
    Snyk, and Prisma Cloud.

    test automation across the entire SDLC, as this is key to unlocking the full benefits
    of DevOps. These benefits include the ability to build, test, and release faster
    and more consistently. To improve **incident response** (**IR**) encourage cooperation,
    and communicate effectively across teams, it is no longer viable to subject new
    code to hours or even days of manual QA testing before the software developers
    receive feedback about their work. QA teams must align their efforts around the
    DevOps release management life cycle by ensuring that test cases are automated
    and that they feature complete code coverage, where attainable. The configuration
    of environments needs to be standardized through the use of IaC and deployments
    should be provisioned automatically and immutably. Put another way, any pre-testing
    duties, such as infrastructure provisioning, environment configuration, post-testing
    tasks, cleanups, or related, repeatable, and mundane items should all be automated,
    aligning with the philosophy of CI.

    so that you can attain economies of scale. To begin with, automated testing maximizes
    the likelihood that errors will be caught before they make it into production.
    It also speeds up the release process by notifying you of bugs and defects as
    soon as they are detected. Furthermore, a significant advantage of implementing
    CI is the potential for smaller teams to successfully perform heavier lifts. Concurrent
    integration allows you to execute multiple automated tests in rapid succession,
    commonly finished within only a few minutes each, which further reduces your testing
    expenditures. It may seem overwhelming to automate your entire development process,
    but you can start small by automating a single end-to-end process and running
    it on a regular basis. New tools and resources make automated testing more approachable
    than ever, and the benefits justify the expense. Automated testing empowers you
    to eliminate bottlenecks and boost productivity, which usually increases employee
    and customer happiness, as well as the revenue being deposited in your company’s
    bank account.

    to scale operations at the speed of today’s contemporary digital marketplace.
    DevOps techniques have a track record of producing consistent quality with reduced
    risk. This is accomplished, in part, by distributing work across multiple small
    teams that operate in a self-sufficient manner yet will socialize as a cohesive
    tribe. This communal development style encourages sharing individual techniques
    and ideas among team members while instilling a common philosophy as a **business
    unit** (**BU**). Because of the massive gains in productivity that result from
    automated testing, you will experience far better team collaboration. Your colleagues
    will not have to devote as much of their time and effort toiling over manual testing
    protocols. Instead, teams will have more opportunities for discussing optimization
    strategies or going out for fraternal lunches. Because you chose to adopt the
    DevOps culture, you have chosen shared responsibility for quality that instills
    a sense of pride among team members. By now, you can see that automated testing
    is a DevOps mainstay.

    is change management. Many existing approaches to change management directly contradict
    the foundational tenets of the DevOps philosophy. Longer release cycles and delays
    in providing value to the client are virtually guaranteed by the bureaucracy and
    gates introduced by traditional strategies, which require numerous levels of permission
    for every change. This runs counter to the DevOps philosophy, which emphasizes
    fast iteration and frequent customer benefit. To effectively implement a DevOps
    strategy for managing changes, we must abandon our traditional, insular focus
    on maintaining stability. To fully grasp how change management can facilitate
    rapid response and adaptability while maintaining consistency, we must extend
    our lens. We don’t utilize the change approval process as roadblocks to slow down
    innovation, but rather as part of a process to speed up the delivery of new features
    to our customers.

    enabling them to conduct numerous releases on a daily basis, sometimes reaching
    double-digit or even triple-digit figures. To effectively implement change management
    at a rapid speed, it is imperative to incorporate it into CI/CD processes. There
    are several **IT service management** (**ITSM**) tools, such as ServiceNow, Jira,
    Freshservice, and Zendesk, that provide an **application programming interface**
    (**API**), enabling seamless integration between your CD pipeline and your change
    management system. By utilizing these APIs, organizations have the capability
    to automatically generate change tickets and notify relevant parties involved.
    This practice guarantees the availability of a ticket for each modification without
    imposing any additional strain or impeding the deployment process. Numerous businesses
    have successfully facilitated the convergence of process structure, collaborative
    culture, and change management tooling, paving the way to achieving stable operating

    advantages. After implementing audit trails, anyone who is interested can find
    out how much time was spent for a recent modification to go live, why it was necessary,
    who gave their approval for it, and whether or not all checkmarks in the preceding
    phases were marked off. For instance, when an auditor demands documentation that
    a change followed your procedure in the future, all that will be required of you
    is to trace the log trails backward. You can configure fine-grained access to
    all of the information. However, along with these advantages come significant
    challenges. This is especially true in situations that require bypassing change
    management gates in order to commit manual changes in a production environment

    and taking advantage of cloud computing are crucial to guaranteeing 99.999% uptime,
    and with no data loss. When DR planning becomes part of an organization’s DevOps
    pipeline strategy, it is often managed alongside the application itself, such
    that the changes to both get vetted on a regular basis. By including DR planning
    in the DevOps workflow, the recovery process is effectively transformed into a
    process similar to deploying an application. In addition to reducing the likelihood
    of mistakes, this also helps expedite the release of new software applications.

    processes used to guarantee that customers have access to a stable and safe build
    of a company’s software product. The duties and responsibilities of a release
    pipeline are to ensure that product enhancements are quickly and safely delivered
    to end users, beginning with changes to source code that are driven through development,
    testing, and release. **Continuous delivery** (**CD**), the process of making
    sure your code base can be safely deployed at any moment, works hand in hand with
    release pipelines. The reason for this is that they lessen the amount of time
    that developers must spend on tedious work or correcting inevitable bugs that

    the time required to deliver a new release while still guaranteeing stability.
    In case something goes wrong, you’ll have automatic rollback procedures and fail-safes
    in place. Overall, your users will have access to new features (or bug fixes)
    sooner. Predictability and dependability are both improved through release pipelines,
    and increased developer productivity is another advantage. Developers can avoid
    wasting time justifying their actions or refactoring releases after the fact due

    feedback loops, and iterative, incremental work. Only after adhering to these
    principles will developers quickly assess how well their code has been written
