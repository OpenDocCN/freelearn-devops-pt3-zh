<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">The SDLC refers to the systematic approach that development teams use to produce high-quality software with </span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">optimal cost efficiency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">The primary goal is to mitigate risk and ensure that the software being developed surpasses the customer’s expectations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Using this method, you will first create a comprehensive strategy that will direct product development, and then you will break it all down into more manageable components that can be scheduled, finished, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">and measured.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">The SDLC can be understood as a conceptual framework that outlines the many stages encompassed by a chosen methodology rather than being a methodology in and of itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">That is to say, the SDLC process exhibits variations across different teams and products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">Nevertheless, it is worth noting that many of the same stages are commonly shared among the majority </span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">of SDLC models that are in common practice today. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">These stages include </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">planning and analysis</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">build</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">testing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">implementation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">,</span><strong class="bold"> </strong><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">and </span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">maintenance/support</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">The first phase of the SDLC is the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">project planning stage</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">, where you gather business requirements from your clients and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">stakeholders. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">The primary objective of this phase is to enable you to define the fundamental problem a customer is facing and discover appropriate solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">Planning facilitates the identification of the essential components that are necessary for the development of a new system, enabling the fulfillment of project</span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1"> requirements by applying a deliberate and methodical process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Analysis allows you to acquire the necessary resources before starting a new software development endeavor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">At this point, calculations are made regarding the resources, costs, and time required to successfully complete </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">the project.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">In order to effectively determine the scope of production, prioritize production items, and establish a development cadence, business analysts engage with their customers to collect requirements, determine the target demographic, and consult with industry professionals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">All of this is done with the objective </span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">of formulating a comprehensive </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">business specification</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">BS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">) document. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">This document may be commonly referred to as the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">customer requirement specification</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">CRS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">) by various organizations and teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">It should be </span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">noted that although creating a BS document is considered good practice, some development teams may choose to forgo using one, opting instead for a less formal approach, as you will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">soon discover.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">The goal of a BS document is so that you can provide a list of client problems that currently exist so that programmers can fix them using software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">It can be a valuable tool in assisting the group in thinking outside of the box about how to make products better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">You should hand off the document to the development team once it has been determined that the software project is in line with the business and stakeholder goals, is feasible to construct, and fulfills </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">user demands.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">2. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">Define Requirements</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">The aforementioned phase is significant as it facilitates the transformation of the data that you’ve acquired during the planning and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">analysis phase into well-defined requirements for the team members who are responsible for development. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Defining requirements</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> facilitates the creation of many important documents, including a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">software requirement specification</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">SRS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">), a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">use case document</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">, and a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">requirement traceability matrix document</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">if needed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">According to the business </span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">specification document, senior members of the development team collaborate with stakeholders and specialists to plan the software development project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">The project could be about making a new software product or making an existing one even better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">Identifying potential difficulties at this early stage is crucial. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">If a problem is discovered, managers and developers propose various</span><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> solutions, which are then presented and analyzed in order to identify </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">optimal alternatives.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">During this preliminary stage of development, team members collaborate on comprehensive plans related to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">The intentions behind </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">the project</span></span></li>

<li><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Opportunities</span></span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Risks</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">The primary objective of this stage is to accurately determine the functional requirements for a project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Performing this necessary analysis ensures that the final deliverable aligns with the specific requirements and expectations of your clients and includes the proactive measures that must be taken in order to guarantee the fulfillment of your customers’ needs </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">and preferences.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">In short, this SDLC stage is employed as a comprehensive technical blueprint wherein clients articulate their expectations, requirements, and demands for the project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">By defining all of these elements, you can ensure that all elements of your software projects receive equitable consideration during the design and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">development process.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">3. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">Design</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">The </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">design stage</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1"> is when you begin</span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1"> translating ideas into a tangible form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">The initial strategy and vision are further developed and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1"> documented in the form of a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">software design document</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">SDD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">) that defines several aspects, such as system architecture, programming language selection, template</span><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1"> utilization, platform choice, and the implementation of application security measures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">This is also the location where you can create diagrams and flowcharts that illustrate the software’s response to user activities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">Sometimes, the design process includes the creation of a minimum viable product or proof-of-concept. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.4">A pre-production version of the product can help you imagine how the final product will look. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.5">This helps to keep any required adjustments minor and also helps the team avoid having to completely rewrite the code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">from scratch.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">The SDD will play a vital role in the production process, particularly in the development stage (see stage 4). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">Developers will rely heavily on the SDD as their primary reference to write their code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.3">In order to mitigate any potential issues and risks identified in the earlier phases, you must also consult the SRS document as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.4">It serves as a reference point for designing the product, ensuring that it incorporates measures that shield the team from any potential risks </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">identified earlier.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">A real-world example that showcases the design phase’s usefulness is exemplified by how local and federal government agencies use it to establish scalable frameworks that are consistent and repeatable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">To accomplish this, the design phase of the SDLC might consist of pre-arranged templates and guidelines created by centralized departments that offer structured content used to define, implement, and communicate all project aspects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.3">For example, this helps scale software applications that are used to issue and manage driver’s licenses, voter registration cards, and library cards that are all interoperable across multiple </span><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">jurisdictions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">This is particularly useful in the case of disparate jurisdictions that are managed with varying levels of resources and different styles of leadership, but they must remain federated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">This level of forethought helps determine the costs associated with real-world implementation or ensure that the end result serves all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">stakeholders involved.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">One thing to keep in mind during the third stage of the SDLC is that the end-users should have an opportunity to review the design and articulate any modifications to the intended system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Here, you will work together to create the final technical design documents before going into production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">At this point, all of the necessary requirements for developing new software or systems should be established, and a backlog of work can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">be created.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">4. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">Development</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">The fourth phase of the SDLC is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">where most of the work on a project really begins in earnest. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">A team of programmers, systems engineers, and business developers collaborate together and begin the process of software development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">At this point, a Gannt chart or Kanban board is typically created to make sure that work on the project follows a smooth cadence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.4">Development teams will typically organize their work using one of two approaches: through the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">implementation of sprints</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1"> or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">as a sustained, continuous development endeavor</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">Regardless of the method employed, teams will strive to complete tasks as quickly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">as possible.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">Important note</span></p>
<p class="callout"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">Sprints</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">: A sprint is a limited amount of time that development teams have to get a certain amount of work done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">Sprint duration can vary from one week to one month but is typically about two weeks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.3">The short time constraint of a sprint encourages developers to prioritize the release </span><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">of modest, incremental improvements over the release of large, sweeping changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">Because of this, less time is spent debugging the program, and the end-user experience </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">is improved.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Continuous development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">: Software development approaches that use continuous development and agility share many similarities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">Instead of making massive, all-at-once improvements to software, incremental </span><a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">ones are produced on a continuous basis, allowing for code to be released to users as soon as it is complete and tested. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">Software development, testing, and releasing updates to production environments can all be streamlined and automated using </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">continuous development.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">During the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1"> stage, the product code is written in accordance with the SDD (see stage 3) so that the product can be </span><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">manufactured efficiently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">This involves the development team building out a new system from the ground up or approaching an existing project with new</span><a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1"> requirements and fresh perspectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">This may include facilitating a smooth and cost-effective digital transformation from an existing system to a new one in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">the cloud.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">During this stage, developers break down the project into smaller software components that will eventually become the finished product. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">In order to construct the code, developers make use of a wide</span><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1"> variety of tools and computer languages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">These are chosen in accordance with the prerequisites of the software products that are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">being built.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">Big bang</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">: The big bang approach lacks the process-oriented characteristics of other release management </span><a id="_idIndexMarker046"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">models, and no advance preparation is needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">Software development is the primary focus of this strategy, which allows programmers to bypass the planning phase and move directly into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">code production.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">Rolling release</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">: A rolling release, often referred to as a rolling update, is a type of software development model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">Software improvements</span><a id="_idIndexMarker047"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1"> are developed in ongoing, incremental steps rather</span><a id="_idIndexMarker048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1"> than in discrete version releases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">Users can upgrade the program at any moment to get the most recent version, and they are encouraged to do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">so often.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">Blue/green deployments</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">: Blue/green deployments produce two identical environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.2">One environment (blue) runs the existing program version, and one (green) runs the new one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.3">After </span><a id="_idIndexMarker049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">testing passes on the green environment, live application traffic is directed there, and the blue environment is depreciated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">By simplifying rollbacks if deployments fail, blue/green deployment strategies boost application availability and reduce </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">deployment risk.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">Canary deployments</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">: A canary deployment refers to a gradual and controlled release strategy for an </span><a id="_idIndexMarker050"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">application, wherein traffic is divided between an existing version and a new version. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">This approach involves initially introducing the new version to a subset of users before expanding its deployment to the entire user base. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.3">By following this approach, one can determine the reliability of the updated version of the application prior to its widespread distribution </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">to consumers.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">At the end of the deployment phase, your final product is delivered to your end users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">At this point, deployment engineers set up the software at the business and/or provide users with assistance in getting the program up and running. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.3">Depending on the kind of SRLC that your team is following, you can automate this procedure and schedule your deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.4">For instance, in the case of implementing a single feature update, it is possible to execute this process by initially releasing it to a limited subset of customers; this is referred to as a “canary release,” as mentioned </span><a id="_idIndexMarker051"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">earlier. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.2">If you are creating brand-new software, you may opt to roll it out internally as an alpha release first. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.3">We’ll briefly expand on SRLC later, but this topic is considered out of the scope of the subject of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">this book.</span></span></p>
