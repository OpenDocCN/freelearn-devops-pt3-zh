			<p>You've talked to recruiters, gone over the job description and the level of remuneration, and set up an interview. This can be a daunting process, so we are going to spend the next several pages breaking it down, talking about all the steps involved, the best preparation practices, and other tricks of the trade. In the following chapter, we will go into more depth and even talk about non-typical interview cases.</p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Phases of the interview process</li>
				<li>Best ways to prepare</li>
				<li>What to expect</li>
				<li>Tricks of the trade</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Phases of the interview process</h1>
			<p>Usually, after the initial setup call, your first stop is with the hiring manager. Obviously, this can vary from place to place, but I find it to be the most common starting point. In our <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>field, you can expect a technical screening round, which can be conducted by an individual or by a panel. For lead or management jobs, this can be conducted by your peers or maybe even by the people that report to you. Depending on the company, this can lead to another individual call with someone from your future leadership, which could mean your future boss or even their boss! Things they look for here are culture fit, the ability to communicate, and general compatibility. We will go into detail later. In some places, they may have more rounds. I have seen design-focused interviews, coding challenges, situational questions, behavioral, and even out-of-the-box thinking. I will cover this in <a href="B18117_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Interviews Step by Step</em>. </p>
			<p>I also want to mention the fact that some technical jobs have programming tests, which could be offline or live, with someone watching you code and asking you questions. Some companies may also ask you to undertake behavioral or cognitive tests. I will cover these things in the non-typical interview walk-through. Coding tests might be common for software engineers, but much less so for DevOps professionals. I think three rounds is probably the most common setup. If you are being interviewed at larger companies, such as Fortune 100 companies, the process may entail four or five rounds.</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1 – Interview stages</p>
			<p>For a lot of places <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>though, it's three rounds, short and simple. Preparing for your first round is not difficult, but it's one of the places where a lot of candidates leave work on the table, so let's start there.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>First-round interview</h2>
			<p>While you may speak with a recruiter and a person from human resources first, we consider the first-round interview to be with someone from your team. Typically, this is the hiring <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>manager. This interview can last from 30 minutes to an hour, and it usually involves the hiring manager telling you about the company, the team, what they need, and then asking you for your experience. Make sure you have done your homework and you know something about the company.</p>
			<p>If you have read the job description, you should know roughly what they are looking for and how your experience matches their search. When talking about your job experience, you should highlight your skills and anything you think is relevant to the position you are applying for.</p>
			<p>You should start by providing an overview of your career and spend 5 minutes highlighting who you are and what you have been doing. If you can address how you and your experience fit into this role, all the better.</p>
			<p>One question they will certainly have for you, especially if you are not fresh out of college, is why you are looking to work at their company, or why you are looking to make a change. Usually, you can say you are looking for better pay, but that will not convince your future employer that you will not leave them for better remuneration elsewhere in the future. It is better to tie your desire for a new role to your career development and to the company you are applying for directly. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to show enthusiasm and interest in working with them.</p>
			<p>Something I have noticed that hiring managers do at this stage is trying to determine how <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>you would fit into the team. For example, if you are a manager, they will ask you about your leadership style. They may also ask you situational questions, such as <em class="italic">you telling them about a time</em> when you dealt with a particular issue. They may also ask you how you see yourself in terms of strengths, weaknesses, and career prospects, such as where you see yourself in 5 years.</p>
			<p>Depending on who you are being interviewed by, you can expect to answer a few or the majority of these questions. Amazon in particular places great stock on this type of interview question.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: First-Round Prep</p>
			<p class="callout">As a general best practice, have a few stories pre-prepared about how you have dealt with common scenarios. For example, tell me about a time when you disagreed with a stakeholder and how you went about resolving this. People want to know you can handle disagreement and friction, and are resilient enough to survive the modern workplace, so have a few stories to hand that showcase how you dealt with, and overcame, adversity and similar situations. Keep a spreadsheet or document handy and practice, and this will become second nature.</p>
			<p>Once they have told you about themselves and the team, and once you have gone over your background and answered whatever questions they might have, they will certainly ask you whether you have any questions. This is a great time to show that you did your homework and ask about the company, its future plans, and how you can contribute to making their efforts better. </p>
			<p>Other important <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>questions you can ask include the company's next steps and whether there are any reasons why you may have a challenge filling this role, or even better yet, what they think is necessary to be successful at this role. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Technical interview</h2>
			<p>This round can look quite different depending on where you interview. It could be a coding test, where someone gives you a problem and watches you solve it, possibly providing you with <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>prompts followed by a period where you are required to work on the solution. During this time, they may ask questions regarding your work. It could be a panel interview, where three peers or experts ask you technical questions to see how deep your understanding extends across multiple domains. This is the most important round because you will be hired primarily for what you know, not for what you have done, and this is your opportunity to show it. Do not be afraid to ask questions if you need to, or to say <em class="italic">I don't know</em> when you are not sure. This is better than rambling, where you can end up digging a hole for yourself. You can always say <em class="italic">this is not my area of expertise</em> and prompt the interviewer to ask you a different question. Nobody knows everything, and so it is extremely easy to be stumped by someone who is trying to stump you. What you want to show are thoughtful answers and that you think about solutions in an intelligent and creative way.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Technical Interview</p>
			<p class="callout">The technical interview is the most stressful part of the interview process, and it is designed to be that way. Use this to your benefit, stay calm, and allow yourself to process what is being asked of you. Ask for another question if you are not familiar with the concept or language of the one given to you. </p>
			<p>Usually, at tech giants (Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on), there will be a difficult technical assessment that challenges your knowledge of computer science, including data structures, critical thinking, objects, and Big O notation. For cloud-related jobs, you may be asked specific questions on cloud services akin to those asked in certification exams. It pays to ask the recruiter what type of interview you will be facing next and whether there is any preparation advice. When there is a coding challenge, typically they employ a platform that allows you to use multiple programming languages, so you can generally use the one you are most familiar with. I always use Python, on account of how simple it is to use, but if you are more comfortable with Java, go for it. The key is to be proficient with at least one programming language. For these types of interviews, it is best to get plenty of practice, as stated previously. The following URL, <a href="https://leetcode.com/">https://leetcode.com/</a>, and <em class="italic">Cracking the Coding Interview </em>(a book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell) are great resources. </p>
			<p>You are also expected to be familiar with Linux unless otherwise specified, and this implies that you are familiar with Bash and shell commands and scripting. Depending on <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>the position and the company, you may also need to talk about architecture or specific systems.</p>
			<p>Finally, there is the possibility of take-home assignments and homework. This can vary from architectural diagrams and design documents to coding challenges and actual services deployed in the cloud, which they will connect to and verify. If they are take-home assignments, time is on your side, so do not panic; just set aside a day when you can focus on this.</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2 – Technical interview types</p>
			<p>We will talk more <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>about exceptions to the interview process in a future chapter, but right now, let's discuss the follow-up round.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Follow-up rounds</h2>
			<p>There could be one or more follow-up rounds, depending on the company and position. For example, there could be a dedicated architecture or design interview where an expert <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>in that area poses a scenario and wants to see how you approach the problem. If you are in leadership, it could be meeting a fellow leader from another team, or even your boss' boss. Interviewing with other teams is not uncommon, especially when there is clear overlap, such as with QA, testing, and DevOps. If you are an individual contributor, you can meet a fellow engineer, a more senior engineer, or an engineer from another team that collaborates closely with yours. DevOps is very collaborative, so you will meet people outside your own team, and it is important to show that you are customer service-oriented and a team player.</p>
			<p>If you are in leadership, you can expect a panel interview for your technical knowledge and another panel interview for your leadership and collaborative qualities. These tend to be with other leaders in the org, usually peers or individuals at a similar level.</p>
			<p>It is also common to meet with the person above the hiring manager, as you are part of their org. This will not be a technical interview, but a combination of a culture fit, leadership style, and aspirational qualities check. If you are a leader, be prepared to speak about your leadership style in depth, with concrete examples. If you are an individual contributor, you may be asked a growth-related question, where you are expected to share career plans so they can see how your plans align with their needs. It is common to be asked where you see yourself in 5 years, so having a rough outline in mind is advantageous.</p>
			<p>You should hear a decision within a week of your last interview, but this can fluctuate if they are interviewing many candidates. Always follow up with the recruiter to find out the next steps but give them some time as even consolidating all the feedback from multiple interviews can take time.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Best ways to prepare</h1>
			<p>Before interviewing, the best way to prepare is by researching the company, your hiring manager, and the position. The job description document will have a lot of information <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>regarding what their ideal candidate looks like. If you lack a skill that is highlighted there, you could try beefing up your knowledge in that area. If there is something required in which you are an expert, make sure you highlight this.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Technical Round Prep</p>
			<p class="callout">For the technical round, it's best to be prepared to have your résumé challenged. Everything in it is fair game, so don't misrepresent yourself!</p>
			<p>Ask the person responsible for scheduling your interviews or your contact in HR what to expect in each round, and doubly so for technical rounds. You can get sample questions or useful feedback from prior interviews if you just ask.</p>
			<p>If there are many items on the job description that are unfamiliar, there are many options to take quick courses in a few days leading up to the interview. This will help you thrive in the technical aspects as well. Sites such as Udemy, Pluralsight, and even YouTube have many tutorials on technical subject matter. Another aspect, if it applies to your interview, is coding challenges. Coding challenges can be very intimidating, due to being watched by the interviewer while trying to write code. A way to practice for this is to use websites such as <em class="italic">LeetCode</em>. These websites also offer optimal solutions to coding challenges as well. A good idea is to do these often, even when you are not interviewing, in order to become comfortable in these types of case scenarios.</p>
			<p>In general, you should have an understanding of what is expected from the role you are applying for, and you should also have an understanding of your strengths and weakness. If coding is not your strength and there is a coding challenge in your future, spend some time studying algorithms and common programming challenges. The interview has a lot of interview and preparation material, and you are just limited by the time you have to absorb it. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Interviewing for Practice</p>
			<p class="callout">The best way to improve any skill is by practice and repetition. This is true for interviewing as well. Even if you are not actively looking for a job, you should apply for positions and go through the interviewing process. Each time you do this you will gain additional insight into the interview process; use the feedback you get and apply it to your preparation rituals. </p>
			<p class="callout">You likely have a shortlist of companies that you would leave your current employer for if you were offered a job. And guess what?! You are not going to be offered a job if you never apply, and likely you haven't applied because you do not feel qualified or have heard stories of how hard the interview process is. Let this be the push for you to go and try. There is a high probability you will fail the first time, especially if it is for a company such as Netflix, Google, Amazon, or Facebook. </p>
			<p class="callout">As I mentioned previously, practice makes perfect, and in this case, failure will only make you better, and who knows, maybe you will land your dream job at your first attempt.</p>
			<p>Beyond doing your research and technical preparation, you should answer some common situational questions, such as what would you do if, or have you ever done this or that. If you <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>search online for interview questions, you can find some common questions and then compile answers for them in writing. Rehearsing these answers will make sure not only that your answer is strong and convincing, but that your delivery is crisp and enticing. You don't want to clear the technical hurdles and then stumble because you had a hard time communicating how you overcame your challenges or how you collaborate across the organization. As with everything else, practice makes <a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>perfect.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-151">What t<a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>o expect</h1>
			<p>If things go well after you finish the entire interview loop, you may get feedback in as little as 1 week. This could be longer if they have a lot of candidates to interview. If you did not perform well, the loop may end prematurely, and you may get an automated message thanking you but they are moving forward with other candidates. Do not be discouraged. I estimate it takes at least 50 applications to get an offer for a job you may really want, taking 5-10 interviews. Very few people apply for one role and get an interview and an offer. There is a lot of competition for high-paying technical jobs, so be patient and try to stack the deck in your favor as much as you can.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.3 – Submitted applications versus final interviews</p>
			<p>Normally, after every round, you have the opportunity to ask questions, so feel free to ask about the <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>next stage and gather some <a id="_idIndexMarker443"/>early intelligence. If you need more time to prepare, don't rush your interview! Let your recruiter know and reschedule if needed.</p>
			<p>If you do get a rejection, do not be discouraged. While it would be great to ask the company that just turned you down regarding the reasons behind the rejection, more often than not, they refuse to go into detail, and it could be a combination of lack of time to address every candidate, or even to avoid some kind of liability. Either way, you can expect an automated rejection email, stating that they are moving forward with other candidates. </p>
			<p>Even if you don't get direct feedback, now is the time to analyze the situation for yourself and figure out what went wrong, what when right, and what you can do better.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, you can fail to land a job even after you thought you performed great in all the interviews simply because there could be a better candidate. Sometimes a better candidate <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>could be for all sorts of <a id="_idIndexMarker445"/>reasons, including a candidate who asks for less pay, a candidate who has been referred, or a candidate with a preferred geographical location. It could be a myriad of reasons, but if you get into the habit of analyzing your performance after every failed interview loop, you can rest assured you will gradually get better. In my experience, you can always know more, but beyond that, you can always communicate better. </p>
			<h3>The continuous interview cycle</h3>
			<p>Next, I would like <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>to introduce the concept of the continuous interview cycle, which consists of three phases: <strong class="bold">application and preparation</strong>, <strong class="bold">interview</strong>, and <strong class="bold">feedback</strong>.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer104" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_8.4.jpg" alt="Figure 8.4 – Continuous interview cycle&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4 – Continuous interview cycle</p>
			<p>We will start by discussing the application and preparation phase of the interview cycle.</p>
			<h4>Application and preparation phase</h4>
			<p>You are applying for roles as well as preparing for upcoming interviews in this phase of the <a id="_idIndexMarker447"/>cycle. If you have already received feedback from previous interviews, ensure that you incorporate that feedback into your preparation to ensure your interview technique is continuously evolving and improving. </p>
			<h4>Interview phase</h4>
			<p>The interview phase consists of all the interviews that are part of the company's interview <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>process. This phase lasts until you receive feedback, which could be positive or negative.</p>
			<h4>Feedback phase</h4>
			<p>This is the stage where you must process the feedback you get from the employer. In the event you are <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>offered a job, you must decide whether to accept the offer, decline the offer, or counter the offer. In the event that you are not offered the job, you may be sent feedback as to why; if you are not, you should do a retrospective of the interview process. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we will discuss the tricks<a id="_idTextAnchor193"/><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/> of the tr<a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>ade.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152">Tricks of the<a id="_idTextAnchor196"/> trade</h1>
			<p>The way to get the best results out of your time invested is to make sure you devote the necessary time to preparing for every interview. This can be difficult if you have a lot of interviews going on and you are still working, but consider that you can be disqualified over a number of things, but you won't know until after the effort has been expended. It can be tough to learn that you didn't make the team over a small issue after spending several weeks interviewing. Don't interview for roles you are not really interested in, or that you don't think are worth the extra preparation. Do yourself a solid and stack the deck in your favor.</p>
			<p>In the next sections, we will go through things that I have found to be effective in the interview process as well as things that I have found to be ineffective and detrimental to your success. First, take a look at the visual representation seen in the followi<a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>ng diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer105" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_8.5.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5 – Do not do that; do this instead&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5 – Do not do that; do this instead</p>
			<p>In the next portion of the chapter, we will cover mistakes that candidates often make during the interview process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>Common mistakes</h2>
			<p>The following is a list of things that have been used by me and proven effective during the interview <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>process. It is not a complete list and I encourage readers to go and discover insights from others, so as to give yourself the best opportunity for success with your interview:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Not fully understanding the question:<ul><li>This happens very often in all types of interviews, not just technical interviews. Often, the interviewee will hear a few words and start coming up with solutions in their head and miss the rest of the question and end up getting it completely wrong. Always wait to hear and fully understand the question before going to the solution phase.<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Take Notes</p><p class="callout">The best way to ensure you do not miss anything is by taking notes. You can use a notepad and pen if the interview is in person or a notepad app on your computer if it is virtual. This will demonstrate your interest and, at the same time, allow you to fully grasp the question before responding, while allowing you to ask any question you may have before answering as well.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>Not writing edge cases:<ul><li>Many times, in coding questions or challenges, the interviewee will not write any edge/corner cases in their code. Remember, your solution will be running <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>through pre-generated test cases, and it will certainly fail if you have not written code to manage edge/corner cases.<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Practice TDD</p><p class="callout">In the first chapter of the book, <a href="B18117_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Career Paths</em>, we discussed how DevOps incorporates many extreme programming practices, including <strong class="bold">Test-Driven Development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>), which has the program write test cases that will fail until proper code is implemented. If time allows, which would be the case with take-home <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>assignments, TDD practices can be used to ensure edge cases are not missed while also demonstrating your knowledge of extreme programming practices.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>Unfamiliarity with the language:<ul><li>Interviewees will want to write code in Python during interviews since it is like pseudo code. This is perfectly fine if you choose to do so, but please be sure to be sufficiently familiar with the language of your choice so that you know how to perform basic string manipulation, arithmetic operations, and are comfortable creating data structures. If you are not very familiar with the language of your choice, this will leave the interviewer thinking that you are not familiar with writing code or that you do not write code very often.<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Sign Up for Daily Coding Problems</p><p class="callout">Sign up to receive a coding challenge problem in your email each day at <a href="https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/">https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/</a>. The following day, you will be sent the solution. I have used this, and it has helped me with coding interviews, as well as enabling me to feel more comfortable with pair and mob programming.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>Being quiet:<ul><li>Often, when interviewees are thinking, they will do it quietly. This is the opposite of what is expected. Usually, the interviewer just wants to see the way you think and the method by which you solve problems. Being quiet leads <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>to a misrepresentation of assumptions by the interviewer. Instead, work through the problem verbally and ensure the interviewer is included in your thought process.<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Don't Pretend to Know Material That You Do Not!</p><p class="callout">Often, those that are getting interviewed panic when they are asked a question and they do not know the answer or are completely unfamiliar with the subject matter. In the technical world, new technologies are being implemented daily, so you will not know everything. This is NORMAL. It is almost always better to just state "I am not familiar with this, but it sounds really interesting to learn about," rather than try to make something up. Remember, the interviewer is probably an expert with that technology, and they will know immediately if <a id="_idTextAnchor199"/><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>you are<a id="_idTextAnchor201"/> bluffing.</p></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>Things that do work</h2>
			<p>The most important thing when it comes to negotiation is to do your research: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>On the company, on the role, on the skills required, on the hiring manager, on the news. Even research on the interview process itself can give you the edge you need to prepare. Research, research, and undertake more research to get the edge that other candidates do not have.<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Find an Inside Source</p><p class="callout">The best way to get information on a company is by chatting with someone from that company. LinkedIn makes it easy to find connections who work at specific companies who are within your network. </p></li>
				<li>Once you are <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>in the thick of your job search, you can expect to have interviews with more than one company simultaneously: <ul><li>Keep a spreadsheet tracking who the recruiter and hiring manager are at a minimum, as well as any facts you may need at a moment's notice. It's also useful to keep track of where you are in the interview process, as well as what level of remuneration was discussed in an earlier conversation.<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Be Consistent</p><p class="callout">You sound disorganized and unprofessional if you give two interviewers two different answers to a question. The most common place this occurs is with remuneration. The recruiter will almost certainly ask you at your initial interview what you are expecting in terms of remuneration and it is important you remember this number and don't inflate it later in the process.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>Applying the principles discussed in the continuous interview cycle section:<ul><li>Always stay fresh and comfortable with interviewing by interviewing regularly, taking the feedback you receive from the interview, and applying that as you prepare for your next interview.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Be comfortable with what you do not know:<ul><li>It is completely acceptable and expected that you will not know everything. Be <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>upfront with interviewers as regards your strengths and weaknesses.<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Be Comfortable with What You Don't Know, but Be Open and Interested in Learning New Things.</p><p class="callout">At this point in the book, it is obvious the value I place on individuals who prioritize continuous learning and self-improvement. Believe me, I am not the only person in a position to hire individuals who have the same outlook. In some cases, someone with a fresh outlook without prior knowledge is<a id="_idTextAnchor203"/> what a team needs.</p></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you gained a lot of insight into the interview process, as well as how to prepare for the distinct phases commonly encountered within. </p>
			<p>We also talked about the various stages and what you can expect, separating the details for an individual contributor as well as for a leadership role.</p>
			<p>We talked about what to expect and how to get the most out of every interview loop, even when you do not end up with an offer in hand.</p>
			<p>Finally, we covered some tips and tricks on what works, and what does not work, in an interview setting.</p>
			<p>We also covered diverse types of interviews in some detail, but we will cover that in more detail in the coming chapters. In the next chapter, we will cover both typical and non-typical interviews and how to navigate and be successful in both types.</p>
