    to pay fair wages based on the skills and expertise of their employees. Fair compensation
    is not only a moral obligation but also a strategic necessity. By ensuring that
    their employees are fairly compensated, companies help foster a robust economy
    filled with prospective customers who have the financial resources to purchase
    their products and services. Additionally, by ensuring that employees are fairly
    compensated, businesses can foster a more motivated and loyal workforce, ultimately
    contributing to a more stable and prosperous outcome. This approach recognizes
    that the very people who contribute to the company’s success are also its customers,

    businesses eliminate inefficiencies, reduce unnecessary inventories, minimize

    improvements become a continuous process. This holistic approach ensures that
    organizations contribute positively to society while achieving their strategic
    goals, ultimately fostering a sustainable and prosperous future for both the company
    and its customers. The key to continuity is understanding that technology, including
    AI, cannot be viewed as a replacement for people but as an enabler for them. People
    drive our economy through their purchases, so we need to view technology as a
    means to expand our economy by freeing up resources to deliver new products and

    Valuable Increments** (**MVIs**). In other words, the product teams had the goal
    of releasing full increments of value as complete features or solutions. Despite

    in Scrum-based methodologies, their issue became apparent. Despite each team performing
    their tasks competently, prolonged product enhancement projects spanning more
    than two sprints resulted in considerable time and effort dedicated to component
    integrations. The root of the problem lay in each team pulling work from the product
    backlog while selecting tasks optimized for their skills, resources, and availability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    as each team focused on implementing distinct capabilities and failed to coordinate

    It became evident that they required a more effective approach to planning, coordinating,
    and integrating their work to deliver value to the customer.

    its reliance on component teams, as opposed to feature teams. A **feature team**,
    known for its cross-functional and cross-component nature, is responsible for
    building and providing end-to-end customer features or slices of features. Conversely,
    a **component team** is a specialized team focused on specific components, such
    as UI, backend development, frontend development, APIs, QA, and testing.

    them to implement with the skills and resources available in their component-based
    teams. Consequently, different parts of the required features were pulled regardless
    of priority. As a result, at the end of each sprint, very little real integration
    could be achieved, as a complete solution was not available for release. When
    each team completed their work, they attempted to integrate the entire system,
    only to discover errors and incorrect assumptions, requiring significant unplanned
    work.

    teams. DevOps builds upon the continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD)
    pipeline concepts developed to support the software development process. Both
    CI/CD and DevOps pipelines utilize technology to integrate, automate, and synchronize
    software development, delivery, and support processes, end to end. While this
    approach aligns closely with Lean-oriented development models, new work enters
    the pipeline on a cadence using Agile’s **Iterative and Incremental Development**
    (**IID**) approach to gathering requirements, planning feature releases, refining
    the backlog, and releasing new enhancements to customers.

    experts, stakeholders, and customers to support their solution delivery efforts.
    These domain experts also likely work in Lean-oriented work environments to maximize
    their ability to deliver value in their areas of work. Effectively, they are loaned
    out to the Agile-based teams on an ad hoc and as-needed basis.

    emphasizes the importance of teams collaborating on a shared backlog to determine
    which features to prioritize and develop collectively. This approach fosters cohesion
    among teams, enabling them to focus on interconnected aspects of the product,
    complete feature components required for integration, and prompt gathering of
    customer feedback.

    together to determine their collective priorities. By doing so, teams can focus
    on interrelated aspects of the product, ensuring the completion of feature components
    necessary for integration and facilitating prompt customer feedback. Additionally,
    this approach minimizes the amount of integration work carried over to subsequent
    sprints. This type of collaboration creates alignment automatically, thereby reducing
    the need to coordinate teams. The effect is lower costs while achieving greater
    efficiency.

    of knowledge work. An example of the first principle of knowledge work is understanding
    how information is processed and utilized within a team or organization to achieve
    its objectives. Instead, Scrum relies on predetermined practices such as sprints,
    cross-functional teams, events, and values. A mantra of Scrum is that teams are
    self-managing, focusing on what’s best for the team individually.
