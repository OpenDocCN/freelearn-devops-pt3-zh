    until you go through it a few times. It is important to understand this as you
    go into this chapter, especially if you are preparing for your first interviews.
    Don't get discouraged if all the information does not make sense at first; some
    will not until you have experienced it first-hand. This chapter will focus on
    the importance of relationships with recruiters and navigating those relationships
    with diverse types of recruiters at various stages of the interview process. We
    will dive deeper into the intricacies of the interview process in [*Chapter 8*](B18117_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor185),
    *Preparing for Your Interview*.

    or another job board. If you apply directly to the job on their website, this
    is the person you might have your first call with. Some companies even divide
    this into separate sub-roles, where one is the source of leads, and another does
    the actual screening. Regardless of whether you meet their criteria, you get access

    refer you to an agency or multiple recruiters before finally talking to the company.
    While they may have insight into roles you do not know about, they are typically
    not on a retainer and the roles are freely available. It is debatable whether

    – is not usually something first-party recruiters take part in; they usually post
    open roles on social platforms and wait to reach out to candidates until they
    apply through their talent management system. Agencies are contracted for their
    ability to go and search for talent; an exceptionally sizable portion of candidates
    that agencies find are from social platforms or past relationships they have built.
    A freelance recruiter's only source of income is finding talent and presenting
    that talent to companies. They are considered the best headhunters because of
    their unnatural ability to find talent where others miss it. The reason they were
    able to become a freelance recruiter is because of the reputation they have built
    up with both candidates in a specific job market as well as employers.

    work or open to the conversation will tell the recruiter that it is OK to contact

    a high-quality picture and high-quality content is key. What makes content high
    quality? Part of it is the writing and part of it is the content. In general,
    I recommend having your profile and resume be the same or very closely related.

    when it comes to all the areas mentioned, it is time to state your goal of finding
    a new position. LinkedIn has different tools to accomplish this, including having
    custom badges that state you are looking for work. For the more privacy-conscious,
    you can make it so that only recruiters see that you are open to new opportunities.
    This signal will let recruiters know to contact you. With a good enough profile,
    you should have a steady swarm of messages and contact requests. I wouldn't add
    every recruiter to your network as you want to keep it balanced with people in
    your field and with people that will improve your domain knowledge or some other
    aspect of your career. You can determine your ratios for yourself, but just know
    that it is not necessary to connect with a recruiter to apply for one of their
    roles. If there is someone you enjoyed working with or that has particularly good
    roles, then it pays to network with them.

    contain nothing at all except a message expressing a desire to connect or have
    a quick phone call. My advice is to do some casual probing and state your requirements

    detail in the *How to negotiate* section, but you want to convey what you are
    looking for and what you are not, and only make appointments or have calls with
    those opportunities that more closely align with what you are looking for.

    bonuses, stocks **restricted stock units** (**RSUs**) or options, for example,
    **paid time off** (**PTO**), and whether you expect to work from home or work
    at the office. Increasingly, people (especially in tech) desire the flexibility
    to work remotely at least some of the time because they can do their job if they
    have a computer and an internet connection. Employers have different expectations,
    so it is important to check with your point of contact to see what their expectation
    is.

- en: So, what are RSUs? According to investopedia.com, an RSU refers to a form of
    compensation that's issued to an employee in the form of company shares. What
    makes them special is that they have a vesting schedule, so you will typically
    earn a percentage after a certain amount of time – say, 25% per year. However,
    RSUs can also be tied to performance metrics, not just employment longevity.

    some jobs what they pay for and use that as a baseline. Not everyone will offer
    this information, but some will, and that will get you started. You can raise
    your asking price until you get resistance, or you can leave things fluid and
    ask for a range. As a rule of thumb, the lower end of your ask is what will be

- en: I remember when I was looking for a leadership role and I saw a Director of
    DevOps role that seemed attractive. It was with a famous firm, so there was some
    prestige associated with the role, and from my initial conversation with the recruiter,
    the compensation seemed to be in line with what I was looking for. I did not ask
    enough questions and deep within the job description, there were more details
    that I could have used to ask sensible questions and make sure that the role was
    right for me.

    to them. I was hoping to lead more than one team as I had several years of experience
    leading 5-10-people teams and thought I was ready for more. I had noticed that
    for a lot of senior roles at big companies, managing managers was a requirement.
    I had led senior folks but never managers, so this was something I was hoping
    to get in my next role.

    that the role was primarily for a technology leader and that it would only have
    two direct reports. Hardly a big team for a director! Some companies treat directors
    as something functional (you lead a group, so you are a director), while others
    treat it as a rank (from a senior manager, you get promoted to a director!) Some,
    however, band the roles based on compensation, and functionally, it could be quite
    different from the same job at another company with similar pay.

    deep experience in one piece of technology. I had some experience, but this was
    not my specialty, and the hiring manager made it known that this was his priority.
    I was frank (as I tend to be) and said that my experience was with a competing
    product, but I was confident in my ability to bridge the gap very quickly. He
    mentioned that he went through the same process and that it took him a long time
    to get caught up, so he assumed it would take me a long time as well. That was
    nonsense, but I was not interested in changing his mind. The lack of a team made
    the role unattractive, and I left the interview feeling like I had wasted everyone's
    time. Read and ask questions first!

    much slower when you stay in the same company year over year. You may get a 2-5%

    determine the salary based on current market conditions, not just based on your

  zh: 我从个人经验中发现的一件事是，当你在同一家公司工作多年时，薪资调整的速度要慢得多。你可能会获得2-5%的加薪，但换工作可能会让你获得15-20%的涨幅。做一些市场调研可以让你根据当前的市场状况来确定薪资，而不仅仅是基于你的职业经历。
- en: One thing to remember is that salaries used to be tailored toward your living
    location. Remote work and competition have lessened this a bit, but there are
    still companies out there that penalize you for living in a lower cost of living
    location. Having a high wage while working at a lower cost of living is called
    arbitrage, and it is something you can take advantage of while working in the
    tech industry.

  zh: 需要记住的一件事是，薪资过去通常会根据你所居住的地点进行调整。远程工作和竞争在一定程度上减轻了这种情况，但仍然有一些公司会因为你住在低生活成本的地区而对你进行惩罚。高工资同时享受低生活成本的现象叫做套利，这在科技行业中是你可以利用的机会。
- en: Working remotely is another huge factor in cost reduction. You can eat at home,
    save on gas, parking, and general car maintenance, and partake in the salary arbitrage.
    I always treat working remotely or remote benefits (working from home 20% of the
    time, for example) as part of the negotiation process. It has made a significant
    difference to my quality of life, and I consider it as important as asking about
    benefits or culture. Conversely, you do not want to stay silent and find out,
    after spending weeks interviewing, that this amazing job requires you to drive
    45 minutes each way or relocate!

  zh: 远程工作是降低成本的另一个重要因素。你可以在家吃饭，节省油费、停车费和汽车维护费，同时还可以利用薪资套利。我总是把远程工作或远程福利（比如每周有20%的时间可以在家工作）作为谈判的一部分。它对我的生活质量有着显著的改善，我把它看作和询问福利或企业文化一样重要。相反，你不希望在面试了几周后才发现，这份看似完美的工作需要你每天往返45分钟，或者要求你搬迁！
- en: Now, there is nothing wrong with relocation, especially early on in your career.
    Getting out of your hometown and into a place where tech jobs are aplenty might
    be advantageous, and a company can certainly help you with the moving costs. Unfortunately,
    arbitrage works both ways and you can end up getting a raise but having the cost
    of living be so much higher that you lose whatever benefit you gained. You may
    even end up on the negative if you move to a much more expensive city! This is
    dangerous in the tech community because cities such as San Francisco, Seattle,
    New York, and LA have a lot of jobs, but they are also some of the most expensive
    cities in the country! Even places such as Austin are much more expensive now
    than they once were, so you want to research the cost of housing (more than other
    metrics) when comparing cities.

  zh: 现在，搬迁本身没有问题，尤其是在职业生涯的早期。从家乡搬到科技职位丰富的地方可能是有利的，公司也可以帮助你支付搬迁费用。不幸的是，套利是双向的，你可能会得到加薪，但生活成本的提高使你失去了获得的任何收益。如果你搬到一个生活成本更高的城市，甚至可能会变得负担更重！在科技圈里，这是一种危险的现象，因为像旧金山、西雅图、纽约和洛杉矶这样的城市拥有很多工作机会，但它们也是美国最昂贵的城市！即使像奥斯汀这样的地方现在也比以前贵得多，所以在比较城市时，你要特别关注住房成本（比其他指标更重要）。
- en: The best tip is to try to normalize your salary and adjust it for each city,
    using a website or calculator. That way, you can ask for a raise and any adjustments
    needed for cost-of-living differences and know exactly how much to ask for. As
    usual, data is king, and you can always use hard numbers and research to back
    up your claims. Recruiters will certainly say that they will pay a salary commensurate
    with experience, but they may be looking at the nationwide numbers, not a number
    that's been adjusted for the specific location being considered.

    example. Such data is available in the US from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

    such as bonuses and equity/stocks, which can be awarded as options. Here, you
    have the option to buy tomorrow at an earlier price, or with RSUs, which are stock
    awards with a multiyear vesting schedule. Usually, you get a yearly amount, and
    they take 4 years to vest, so every year, you are simultaneously earning and vesting
    more. This is common in big tech companies (such as **Meta**, **Apple**, **Amazon**,
    **Netflix,** and **Google**) and when you get high enough on the career ladder
    and become a senior leader. For some roles, the equity component can be worth
    more than the salary! It depends on where you are in your career and your company.

    company performance, or other factors. It could also be discretionary and not
    be awarded at all! Some companies tend to band the bonus payout to performance
    bands, so if you get a 4 out of 5, you may receive 80% of your bonus. Finally,
    some companies pay a percentage of your bonus after 1 year, and the remainder
    after the next, incentivizing you to stay with the company.

    value from that equity package. From that perspective, established public companies
    have more leverage when offering stock awards.

    be a result of toxic company culture or poor planning, and it may result in an
