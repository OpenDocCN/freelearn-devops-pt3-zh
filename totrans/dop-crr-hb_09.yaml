    until you go through it a few times. It is important to understand this as you
    go into this chapter, especially if you are preparing for your first interviews.
    Don't get discouraged if all the information does not make sense at first; some
    will not until you have experienced it first-hand. This chapter will focus on
    the importance of relationships with recruiters and navigating those relationships
    with diverse types of recruiters at various stages of the interview process. We
    will dive deeper into the intricacies of the interview process in [*Chapter 8*](B18117_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor185),

- en: This is a recruiter that works directly for the company and is trying to fill
    a role. They may reach out to you through a social network, most notably LinkedIn,
    or another job board. If you apply directly to the job on their website, this
    is the person you might have your first call with. Some companies even divide
    this into separate sub-roles, where one is the source of leads, and another does
    the actual screening. Regardless of whether you meet their criteria, you get access
    to the interview loop and the team.

    you. They, in turn, try to see how well you align with the job description.

    or HR personnel screen for culture fit and not just skill sets. This means they
    may be paying attention to several things, including how polite you are, how much
    you know about the company, and if the screen is on video, your tidiness, or your
    persona.

    or one that's retained by the end client. An independent company may find your
    profile and submit it to several different jobs. A company on a retainer is searching
    for talent that specifically matches a company profile, but if they are large
    enough, they may have more than one viable candidate company.

    email. They will pass you their job requirements and try to get on the phone with
    you as soon as possible. Most of the time, they are not final clients and may
    refer you to an agency or multiple recruiters before finally talking to the company.
    While they may have insight into roles you do not know about, they are typically
    not on a retainer and the roles are freely available. It is debatable whether
    it is better to apply directly than to apply through a recruiter. It depends on
    whether the recruiter already has a relationship with the hiring manager.

    – is not usually something first-party recruiters take part in; they usually post
    open roles on social platforms and wait to reach out to candidates until they
    apply through their talent management system. Agencies are contracted for their
    ability to go and search for talent; an exceptionally sizable portion of candidates
    that agencies find are from social platforms or past relationships they have built.
    A freelance recruiter's only source of income is finding talent and presenting
    that talent to companies. They are considered the best headhunters because of
    their unnatural ability to find talent where others miss it. The reason they were
    able to become a freelance recruiter is because of the reputation they have built
    up with both candidates in a specific job market as well as employers.

    or through a recruiting agency. It is not common for freelance recruiters to take
    this step, though there are exceptions where this may occur. Follow-up rounds
    are usually scheduled with internal resources, such as team members or individuals
    from other parts of the company you will be working with, and will be coordinated
    by the first-party recruiter.

    resume, recruiters will always find you first. There are many job boards, and
    some recruiters buy entire databases of candidates so that once you are on the

    profile and resume look the same (roughly), with similar summaries and keywords.
    Make these keywords match your experience and the keywords that are used the most
    in search terms and the jobs that interest you.
  prefs: []

- en: You can also add or message recruiters – first- or third -party – directly about
    the jobs they have posted on. While I do not recommend filling your LinkedIn with
    recruiters only, I do think it is normal for 1/3 of your contacts to be related
    to job hunting or career growth. That is the primary purpose of LinkedIn.

    that on your profile and resume. Do not add skills that you do not have, as you
    may be asked for or even tested on them later. However, do scan different job
    posts for these keywords and use them as a guideline of what skills to learn or
    develop further.

    work or open to the conversation will tell the recruiter that it is OK to contact

    appealing to recruiters. Let me reiterate everything I think is key.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first part of highlighting how you present yourself is beefing up your LinkedIn
    profile. We covered this in great detail in [*Chapter 5*](B18117_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138),
    *Building Your Network*, but I will say that having a professional page that has
    a high-quality picture and high-quality content is key. What makes content high
    quality? Part of it is the writing and part of it is the content. In general,
    I recommend having your profile and resume be the same or very closely related.
    I create my resume based on my LinkedIn profile, and whenever there is an update,
    I do it on the profile first, then export the resume later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having someone proofread your position summaries and making sure they are descriptive
    enough goes a long way to having a recruiter read them. In a technical field,
    you must describe the technical skills you used for each job. Rather than speaking
    in generalities, be specific. As an added tip, make sure you include numbers and
    percentages when highlighting results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stressing the most important (and marketable) skills in your summaries is key
    not just for the reader but for the search engine that is looking for those skills
    so that it will return the best matches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you feel like your profile is professional, descriptive, and comprehensive
    when it comes to all the areas mentioned, it is time to state your goal of finding
    a new position. LinkedIn has different tools to accomplish this, including having
    custom badges that state you are looking for work. For the more privacy-conscious,
    you can make it so that only recruiters see that you are open to new opportunities.
    This signal will let recruiters know to contact you. With a good enough profile,
    you should have a steady swarm of messages and contact requests. I wouldn't add
    every recruiter to your network as you want to keep it balanced with people in
    your field and with people that will improve your domain knowledge or some other
    aspect of your career. You can determine your ratios for yourself, but just know
    that it is not necessary to connect with a recruiter to apply for one of their
    roles. If there is someone you enjoyed working with or that has particularly good
    roles, then it pays to network with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, you start getting messages – then what? A lot of the introduction messages
    will provide a brief version of the job description. Some will contain all the
    information you need to determine whether you are interested, while others will
    contain nothing at all except a message expressing a desire to connect or have
    a quick phone call. My advice is to do some casual probing and state your requirements
    before getting on a phone call. Otherwise, you will spend a lot of time sharing
    information about yourself only to discover the role was not for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would request at least a job description and a salary range (annual or hourly)
    at a minimum. Some may not give it, but in my experience, most will, especially
    if you state that you do not want to waste their time. We will cover this in more
    detail in the *How to negotiate* section, but you want to convey what you are
    looking for and what you are not, and only make appointments or have calls with
    those opportunities that more closely align with what you are looking for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Something else you can do to improve how you are perceived is increase your
    social awareness and build your brand. We covered this in great detail in [*Chapter
    5*](B18117_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138), *Building Your Network*, but gaining
    and displaying certifications, authoring articles, or reposting other articles
    in your feed and even authoring books (like this!) can increase your name recognition
    and brand, which can make you more appealing to recruiters and prospective employers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, I will say that you can be proactive about connecting and messaging
    with recruiters and hiring managers. LinkedIn has a professional version that
    allows you to send messages to people outside your network and that you can use
    to query their database. It becomes a little bit cold calling in sales at that
    point. I prefer to build a great profile and let the recruiters come to me.

- en: How to negotiate
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way to negotiate depends on which part of the job hunt you are on. When
    you are dealing with recruiters, you are mostly establishing your rates and your
    desired wages. Other things you may want to establish are your expectations for
    bonuses, stocks **restricted stock units** (**RSUs**) or options, for example,
    **paid time off** (**PTO**), and whether you expect to work from home or work
    at the office. Increasingly, people (especially in tech) desire the flexibility
    to work remotely at least some of the time because they can do their job if they
    have a computer and an internet connection. Employers have different expectations,
    so it is important to check with your point of contact to see what their expectation
    is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what are RSUs? According to investopedia.com, an RSU refers to a form of
    compensation that's issued to an employee in the form of company shares. What
    makes them special is that they have a vesting schedule, so you will typically
    earn a percentage after a certain amount of time – say, 25% per year. However,
    RSUs can also be tied to performance metrics, not just employment longevity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What if you don't know how much you should be asking for? Well, you can ask
    some jobs what they pay for and use that as a baseline. Not everyone will offer
    this information, but some will, and that will get you started. You can raise
    your asking price until you get resistance, or you can leave things fluid and
    ask for a range. As a rule of thumb, the lower end of your ask is what will be
    used to make sure that is a number you are comfortable with. If you get more,
    great, but always ask for what you need straight out of the gate.

- en: I remember when I was looking for a leadership role and I saw a Director of
    DevOps role that seemed attractive. It was with a famous firm, so there was some
    prestige associated with the role, and from my initial conversation with the recruiter,
    the compensation seemed to be in line with what I was looking for. I did not ask
    enough questions and deep within the job description, there were more details
    that I could have used to ask sensible questions and make sure that the role was
    right for me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I could have asked how many people would this person have reporting
    to them. I was hoping to lead more than one team as I had several years of experience
    leading 5-10-people teams and thought I was ready for more. I had noticed that
    for a lot of senior roles at big companies, managing managers was a requirement.
    I had led senior folks but never managers, so this was something I was hoping
    to get in my next role.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I did not ask, and when I had my interview with the hiring manager, they mentioned
    that the role was primarily for a technology leader and that it would only have
    two direct reports. Hardly a big team for a director! Some companies treat directors
    as something functional (you lead a group, so you are a director), while others
    treat it as a rank (from a senior manager, you get promoted to a director!) Some,
    however, band the roles based on compensation, and functionally, it could be quite
    different from the same job at another company with similar pay.
  prefs: []

    deep experience in one piece of technology. I had some experience, but this was
    not my specialty, and the hiring manager made it known that this was his priority.
    I was frank (as I tend to be) and said that my experience was with a competing
    product, but I was confident in my ability to bridge the gap very quickly. He
    mentioned that he went through the same process and that it took him a long time
    to get caught up, so he assumed it would take me a long time as well. That was
    nonsense, but I was not interested in changing his mind. The lack of a team made
    the role unattractive, and I left the interview feeling like I had wasted everyone's
    time. Read and ask questions first!

    Ask other recruiters, friends, colleagues, and even those on social media. Establish
    a far baseline and communicate early. You don't want to waste your time on opportunities
    you would not take.
  prefs: []

    you are with your job and some companies do things differently. You cannot put
    a price on a good culture, so try to get a sense throughout the interview process
    of whether this job is a good fit. Ask yourself whether you see yourself there
    5 years from now. Do the people that interview sound like people you may want
    to hang out with? You cannot infer all this from a quick call with a recruiter,
    but you can certainly ask them about their culture and establish some baselines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing I discovered from personal experience is that salary adjustments are
    much slower when you stay in the same company year over year. You may get a 2-5%
    raise, but changing jobs may get you 15-20%. Doing your research allows you to
    determine the salary based on current market conditions, not just based on your
    career.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing to remember is that salaries used to be tailored toward your living
    location. Remote work and competition have lessened this a bit, but there are
    still companies out there that penalize you for living in a lower cost of living
    location. Having a high wage while working at a lower cost of living is called
    arbitrage, and it is something you can take advantage of while working in the
    tech industry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Working remotely is another huge factor in cost reduction. You can eat at home,
    save on gas, parking, and general car maintenance, and partake in the salary arbitrage.
    I always treat working remotely or remote benefits (working from home 20% of the
    time, for example) as part of the negotiation process. It has made a significant
    difference to my quality of life, and I consider it as important as asking about
    benefits or culture. Conversely, you do not want to stay silent and find out,
    after spending weeks interviewing, that this amazing job requires you to drive
    45 minutes each way or relocate!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, there is nothing wrong with relocation, especially early on in your career.
    Getting out of your hometown and into a place where tech jobs are aplenty might
    be advantageous, and a company can certainly help you with the moving costs. Unfortunately,
    arbitrage works both ways and you can end up getting a raise but having the cost
    of living be so much higher that you lose whatever benefit you gained. You may
    even end up on the negative if you move to a much more expensive city! This is
    dangerous in the tech community because cities such as San Francisco, Seattle,
    New York, and LA have a lot of jobs, but they are also some of the most expensive
    cities in the country! Even places such as Austin are much more expensive now
    than they once were, so you want to research the cost of housing (more than other
    metrics) when comparing cities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best tip is to try to normalize your salary and adjust it for each city,
    using a website or calculator. That way, you can ask for a raise and any adjustments
    needed for cost-of-living differences and know exactly how much to ask for. As
    usual, data is king, and you can always use hard numbers and research to back
    up your claims. Recruiters will certainly say that they will pay a salary commensurate
    with experience, but they may be looking at the nationwide numbers, not a number
    that's been adjusted for the specific location being considered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at a list that specifies the highest cost of living, you will find
    that, for example, San Jose is in the top 10 most expensive, so even if they pay
    high wages, your lifestyle might be lower than if you live in Raleigh, NC, for
    example. Such data is available in the US from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides a base salary, you may want to negotiate in other areas of compensation,
    such as bonuses and equity/stocks, which can be awarded as options. Here, you
    have the option to buy tomorrow at an earlier price, or with RSUs, which are stock
    awards with a multiyear vesting schedule. Usually, you get a yearly amount, and
    they take 4 years to vest, so every year, you are simultaneously earning and vesting
    more. This is common in big tech companies (such as **Meta**, **Apple**, **Amazon**,
    **Netflix,** and **Google**) and when you get high enough on the career ladder
    and become a senior leader. For some roles, the equity component can be worth
    more than the salary! It depends on where you are in your career and your company.

    that that bonus might be dependent on something else, such as your performance,
    company performance, or other factors. It could also be discretionary and not
    be awarded at all! Some companies tend to band the bonus payout to performance
    bands, so if you get a 4 out of 5, you may receive 80% of your bonus. Finally,
    some companies pay a percentage of your bonus after 1 year, and the remainder
    after the next, incentivizing you to stay with the company.

- en: History shows that if you work in a successful company, have stock awards, and
    stay while the company grows, you can potentially make a lot of money as the stock
    of the company grows every year! Now, you must be mindful because not every company
    grows as much as Netflix or Amazon do, and some companies tank and go under.
  prefs: []

    consider this a bonus and not a core component of your pay. After all, it could
    be years before the company has a successful exit and you may never perceive any
    value from that equity package. From that perspective, established public companies
    have more leverage when offering stock awards.

- en: How **long** a role has been posted affects the timeframe you should expect
    to hear back within after applying for a role. The longer a role has been posted,
    the more likely you will get a response quickly. The time when a role was posted
    is not overly telling of an expected response but when it's combined with the
    number of applications that have been received for a role, you can get a good
    estimate.

- en: '**The number of applicants** a role has is a multi-faceted metric; in this
    section, we will only consider how it affects the response time from a recruiter.
    The more applicants a role has, the longer you can expect to wait. In a situation
    where a role has been posted for a long time and has many applicants, your wait
    will be either exceptionally long or quite short. There is a possibility that
    the reason the role has been open for so long is that no suitable candidate has
    been found.'

    hear back quickly from the recruiter and will also have an expedited interview
    process. However, you must ask why there is such an urgent need to fill the role.
    In my experience, as both an interviewer and a candidate, trying to fill a role
    overly quickly is in no one's best interest. An expedited interview process may
    be a result of toxic company culture or poor planning, and it may result in an
    inability for both parties to get an informative read on whether the relationship
    will be fruitful. On the other hand, you will never know if you don't try.

    Calling is not appropriate unless you have been given permission ahead of time.

    are not looking for friends – they are on the hunt for top talent. First, I advise
    against adding recruiters to any non-professional social media such as Facebook.
    First-party recruiters work specifically for a company, not for you, which means
    they owe you nothing, not a response or follow-up, no matter how much you want
    one. For example, if you followed up more than once and they didn''t get back
    to you, then they are just not that interested, and it is time to move on.'

    all your skills is supremely important. Your online profile is your calling card,
    so having the correct set of skills and experience can get you the type of contacts
    you want both from a networking perspective and for specific opportunities.

    daily job hits based on your online profile. Make it a habit to quickly classify
    each job and put it in the right bucket. Contract gigs and salaried roles can
    vary wildly in responsibility and compensation, and you must make sure you know
    the answers you need before you start the interview process!

    sure you know what you are signing up for. The internet makes it easier than ever
    to apply for jobs, but blindly doing so may cost you more time down the line.
    Find out about their salary ranges, share your expectations, and determine whether
    they are in line. Ask about benefits, culture, remote work, and other forms of
    compensation, such as bonuses, equity, or stock.

    is worth less than a dollar in Boise. Ask companies about their relocation packages,
    salary adjustments, and ability to work remotely. Moving for a new job could prove
    to be a great career move, but you certainly don't want to do it at the expense
    of a lower quality of life.

    their time or yours. If an opportunity seems like a terrible job, don't interview
    just for the sake of it. Sure, getting interview practice is valuable, but it's
    better to do it with jobs you are genuinely interested in.

    process, but you may reach out after the fact and state you would like to connect
    regardless.
