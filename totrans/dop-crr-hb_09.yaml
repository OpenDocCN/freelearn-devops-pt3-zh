    until you go through it a few times. It is important to understand this as you
    go into this chapter, especially if you are preparing for your first interviews.
    Don't get discouraged if all the information does not make sense at first; some
    will not until you have experienced it first-hand. This chapter will focus on
    the importance of relationships with recruiters and navigating those relationships
    with diverse types of recruiters at various stages of the interview process. We
    will dive deeper into the intricacies of the interview process in [*Chapter 8*](B18117_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor185),
    *Preparing for Your Interview*.

- en: This is a recruiter that works directly for the company and is trying to fill
    a role. They may reach out to you through a social network, most notably LinkedIn,
    or another job board. If you apply directly to the job on their website, this
    is the person you might have your first call with. Some companies even divide
    this into separate sub-roles, where one is the source of leads, and another does
    the actual screening. Regardless of whether you meet their criteria, you get access
    to the interview loop and the team.

  zh: 这是直接为公司工作的招聘人员，试图填补职位空缺。他们可能通过社交网络联系你，最著名的是 LinkedIn，或者通过其他招聘网站。如果你直接在公司网站上申请职位，那么这个人可能就是你进行第一次电话沟通的对象。有些公司甚至将这分为不同的子角色，一个负责提供候选人线索，另一个负责实际筛选。不管你是否符合他们的要求，你都将进入面试环节并与团队接触。
- en: They are also generally who you would speak to about your salary requirements,
    and ask questions regarding compensation, bonuses, and other areas that may interest
    you. They, in turn, try to see how well you align with the job description.

- en: While this is not a technical interview, don't get too relaxed! Sometimes, recruiters
    or HR personnel screen for culture fit and not just skill sets. This means they
    may be paying attention to several things, including how polite you are, how much
    you know about the company, and if the screen is on video, your tidiness, or your
    persona.

- en: Make sure you treat these calls as part of the interview but don't be afraid
    to ask questions and make sure this is a role worth your time. You don't want

    profile and submit it to several different jobs. A company on a retainer is searching
    for talent that specifically matches a company profile, but if they are large
    enough, they may have more than one viable candidate company.

  zh: 招聘机构分为两种类型之一 - 独立公司或由最终客户保留的公司。独立公司可能会找到您的档案并将其提交给几个不同的工作岗位。如果一家公司被保留，它正在寻找与公司配置文件特别匹配的人才，但如果他们足够大，他们可能有多个可行的候选公司。

    email. They will pass you their job requirements and try to get on the phone with
    you as soon as possible. Most of the time, they are not final clients and may
    refer you to an agency or multiple recruiters before finally talking to the company.
    While they may have insight into roles you do not know about, they are typically
    not on a retainer and the roles are freely available. It is debatable whether
    it is better to apply directly than to apply through a recruiter. It depends on
    whether the recruiter already has a relationship with the hiring manager.

  zh: 自由职业者招聘人员通常会通过LinkedIn或未经请求的电子邮件联系您。他们会传递他们的职位需求，并尽快与您通话。大多数情况下，他们不是最终客户，可能会将您推荐给一个代理机构或多个招聘人员，最终再与公司交谈。虽然他们可能了解您不知道的角色，但他们通常不在保留名单上，这些角色是自由可用的。是否比直接申请更好，还有待商榷，这取决于招聘人员是否已与招聘经理建立了关系。

- en: Talent discovery – that is, actively pursuing social platforms for valid candidates
    – is not usually something first-party recruiters take part in; they usually post
    open roles on social platforms and wait to reach out to candidates until they
    apply through their talent management system. Agencies are contracted for their
    ability to go and search for talent; an exceptionally sizable portion of candidates
    that agencies find are from social platforms or past relationships they have built.
    A freelance recruiter's only source of income is finding talent and presenting
    that talent to companies. They are considered the best headhunters because of
    their unnatural ability to find talent where others miss it. The reason they were
    able to become a freelance recruiter is because of the reputation they have built
    up with both candidates in a specific job market as well as employers.

  zh: 人才发现——也就是主动在社交平台上寻找合适的候选人——通常不是第一方招聘人员参与的事情；他们通常会在社交平台上发布空缺职位，等候候选人通过人才管理系统申请后才会联系他们。招聘公司被雇佣的原因在于他们能够主动去寻找人才；他们所找到的候选人中有相当大一部分来自社交平台或他们建立的过去关系。自由职业招聘人员的唯一收入来源就是找到人才并将这些人才推荐给公司。他们被认为是最优秀的猎头，因为他们有非凡的能力，在别人忽视的地方找到人才。之所以能够成为自由职业招聘人员，是因为他们在特定的招聘市场和雇主中积累了良好的声誉。
- en: The initial interview is usually taken care of by the first-party **human resources**

    posts for these keywords and use them as a guideline of what skills to learn or

  zh: 招聘人员也会进行搜索，当他们搜索*Terraform*时，确保你的个人资料和简历上有相关技能会有所帮助。不要添加你并不具备的技能，因为你可能会被要求或者甚至被测试这些技能。然而，还是建议扫描不同的职位招聘信息，看看哪些关键词出现频率高，并以此为指导，学习或进一步发展相关技能。
- en: Finally, making sure your profile is visible and states that you are open to
    work or open to the conversation will tell the recruiter that it is OK to contact
    you. A good relationship with a recruiter can yield you multiple leads throughout

    profile. We covered this in great detail in [*Chapter 5*](B18117_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138),
    *Building Your Network*, but I will say that having a professional page that has
    a high-quality picture and high-quality content is key. What makes content high
    quality? Part of it is the writing and part of it is the content. In general,
    I recommend having your profile and resume be the same or very closely related.
    I create my resume based on my LinkedIn profile, and whenever there is an update,
    I do it on the profile first, then export the resume later.

  zh: 展示自己的第一步是增强你的LinkedIn个人资料。我们在[*第五章*](B18117_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138)《建立你的网络》中已经详细讨论过这一点，但我想说，拥有一个专业的页面，其中包括高质量的照片和内容是非常关键的。什么样的内容算是高质量的？其中一部分是写作，另一部分是内容本身。通常来说，我建议你的个人资料和简历应该保持一致或非常相关。我是根据我的LinkedIn个人资料来创建简历的，每当有更新时，我首先在个人资料上更新，然后再导出简历。
- en: Having someone proofread your position summaries and making sure they are descriptive
    enough goes a long way to having a recruiter read them. In a technical field,
    you must describe the technical skills you used for each job. Rather than speaking
    in generalities, be specific. As an added tip, make sure you include numbers and
    percentages when highlighting results.

  zh: 找人校对你的职位总结，并确保内容足够具有描述性，能够吸引招聘人员的注意，这对你很有帮助。在技术领域，你必须描述每个职位所用到的技术技能。不要泛泛而谈，而要具体明确。一个小技巧是，强调结果时，尽量加入数字和百分比。

- en: Once you feel like your profile is professional, descriptive, and comprehensive
    when it comes to all the areas mentioned, it is time to state your goal of finding
    a new position. LinkedIn has different tools to accomplish this, including having
    custom badges that state you are looking for work. For the more privacy-conscious,
    you can make it so that only recruiters see that you are open to new opportunities.
    This signal will let recruiters know to contact you. With a good enough profile,
    you should have a steady swarm of messages and contact requests. I wouldn't add
    every recruiter to your network as you want to keep it balanced with people in
    your field and with people that will improve your domain knowledge or some other
    aspect of your career. You can determine your ratios for yourself, but just know
    that it is not necessary to connect with a recruiter to apply for one of their
    roles. If there is someone you enjoyed working with or that has particularly good
    roles, then it pays to network with them.
  id: totrans-50

  zh: 一旦你觉得自己的个人资料在所有提到的领域都显得专业、描述性强且全面时，就该明确表示自己正在寻找新职位了。LinkedIn 提供了不同的工具来实现这一目标，包括定制徽章，表明你正在寻找工作。对于更加注重隐私的人，你可以设置仅招聘人员能够看到你对新机会持开放态度。这一信号会告诉招聘人员联系你。有了一个足够出色的个人资料，你应该会收到源源不断的消息和联系请求。我建议不要将每个招聘人员都加进你的网络，因为你希望保持与自己领域内的人以及能提升你领域知识或其他职业方面的人建立联系。你可以根据自己的需求来决定这些比例，但要知道，申请职位并不一定需要与招聘人员建立联系。如果有某个你曾愉快共事的人，或者有特别好的职位信息的人，那就值得与他们建立联系。
- en: So, you start getting messages – then what? A lot of the introduction messages
    will provide a brief version of the job description. Some will contain all the
    information you need to determine whether you are interested, while others will
    contain nothing at all except a message expressing a desire to connect or have
    a quick phone call. My advice is to do some casual probing and state your requirements
    before getting on a phone call. Otherwise, you will spend a lot of time sharing
    information about yourself only to discover the role was not for you.

  zh: 那么，当你开始收到消息时，接下来该怎么办？许多介绍信息会提供职位描述的简短版本。有些会包含你所需的所有信息来判断自己是否感兴趣，而其他的则只会包含希望联系或者进行简短电话交流的意图。我的建议是在接听电话之前，先做一些简单的探询，并明确你的要求。否则，你会花费很多时间与别人分享自己的信息，最后却发现这个职位并不适合你。
- en: I would request at least a job description and a salary range (annual or hourly)
    at a minimum. Some may not give it, but in my experience, most will, especially
    if you state that you do not want to waste their time. We will cover this in more
    detail in the *How to negotiate* section, but you want to convey what you are
    looking for and what you are not, and only make appointments or have calls with
    those opportunities that more closely align with what you are looking for.

  zh: 我至少会要求获取职位描述和薪资范围（年薪或时薪）。有些人可能不会提供，但根据我的经验，大多数人会提供，尤其是当你明确表示不想浪费他们的时间时。我们将在*如何谈判*部分更详细地讨论这一点，但你需要传达自己正在寻找的和不想要的东西，只与那些与你需求更匹配的机会约定时间或进行通话。
- en: Something else you can do to improve how you are perceived is increase your
    social awareness and build your brand. We covered this in great detail in [*Chapter
    5*](B18117_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138), *Building Your Network*, but gaining
    and displaying certifications, authoring articles, or reposting other articles
    in your feed and even authoring books (like this!) can increase your name recognition
    and brand, which can make you more appealing to recruiters and prospective employers.

  zh: 你还可以做的另一件事是提高自己的社交意识并建立个人品牌。我们在[*第 5 章*](B18117_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138)《建立你的网络》中详细讨论了这一点，获得并展示认证、撰写文章、在你的动态中转发其他文章，甚至撰写书籍（像这本书一样！）都能增加你的知名度和品牌，这样会让你对招聘人员和潜在雇主更具吸引力。
- en: Finally, I will say that you can be proactive about connecting and messaging
    with recruiters and hiring managers. LinkedIn has a professional version that
    allows you to send messages to people outside your network and that you can use
    to query their database. It becomes a little bit cold calling in sales at that
    point. I prefer to build a great profile and let the recruiters come to me.

    bonuses, stocks **restricted stock units** (**RSUs**) or options, for example,
    **paid time off** (**PTO**), and whether you expect to work from home or work
    at the office. Increasingly, people (especially in tech) desire the flexibility
    to work remotely at least some of the time because they can do their job if they
    have a computer and an internet connection. Employers have different expectations,
    so it is important to check with your point of contact to see what their expectation
    is.

  zh: 谈判的方式取决于你在求职的哪个阶段。当你与招聘人员打交道时，你主要是在确定你的薪资和期望的工资。你可能还想确定其他方面，比如奖金、股票**限制性股票单位**（**RSUs**）或期权，比如**带薪休假**（**PTO**），以及你是否希望远程工作或在办公室工作。越来越多的人（尤其是在科技行业）希望至少部分时间能够灵活远程工作，因为他们只要有电脑和网络连接就能完成工作。雇主的期望各不相同，因此重要的是与联系人确认他们的期望是什么。
- en: So, what are RSUs? According to investopedia.com, an RSU refers to a form of
    compensation that's issued to an employee in the form of company shares. What
    makes them special is that they have a vesting schedule, so you will typically
    earn a percentage after a certain amount of time – say, 25% per year. However,
    RSUs can also be tied to performance metrics, not just employment longevity.

  zh: 那么，什么是RSU呢？根据investopedia.com，RSU指的是以公司股票形式发放给员工的一种薪酬形式。它们的特别之处在于有一个归属时间表，通常你会在一定时间后获得一部分权益——比如每年25%。然而，RSU也可以与绩效指标挂钩，而不仅仅是工作年限。
- en: What if you don't know how much you should be asking for? Well, you can ask
    some jobs what they pay for and use that as a baseline. Not everyone will offer
    this information, but some will, and that will get you started. You can raise
    your asking price until you get resistance, or you can leave things fluid and
    ask for a range. As a rule of thumb, the lower end of your ask is what will be
    used to make sure that is a number you are comfortable with. If you get more,
    great, but always ask for what you need straight out of the gate.

- en: One thing to remember is that salaries used to be tailored toward your living
    location. Remote work and competition have lessened this a bit, but there are
    still companies out there that penalize you for living in a lower cost of living

  zh: 需要记住的一件事是，薪资过去通常会根据你所居住的地点进行调整。远程工作和竞争在一定程度上减轻了这种情况，但仍然有一些公司会因为你住在低生活成本的地区而对你进行惩罚。高工资同时享受低生活成本的现象叫做套利，这在科技行业中是你可以利用的机会。
- en: Working remotely is another huge factor in cost reduction. You can eat at home,
    save on gas, parking, and general car maintenance, and partake in the salary arbitrage.
    I always treat working remotely or remote benefits (working from home 20% of the
    time, for example) as part of the negotiation process. It has made a significant
    difference to my quality of life, and I consider it as important as asking about
    benefits or culture. Conversely, you do not want to stay silent and find out,
    after spending weeks interviewing, that this amazing job requires you to drive
    45 minutes each way or relocate!

  zh: 远程工作是降低成本的另一个重要因素。你可以在家吃饭，节省油费、停车费和汽车维护费，同时还可以利用薪资套利。我总是把远程工作或远程福利（比如每周有20%的时间可以在家工作）作为谈判的一部分。它对我的生活质量有着显著的改善，我把它看作和询问福利或企业文化一样重要。相反，你不希望在面试了几周后才发现，这份看似完美的工作需要你每天往返45分钟，或者要求你搬迁！
- en: Now, there is nothing wrong with relocation, especially early on in your career.
    Getting out of your hometown and into a place where tech jobs are aplenty might
    be advantageous, and a company can certainly help you with the moving costs. Unfortunately,
    arbitrage works both ways and you can end up getting a raise but having the cost
    of living be so much higher that you lose whatever benefit you gained. You may
    even end up on the negative if you move to a much more expensive city! This is
    dangerous in the tech community because cities such as San Francisco, Seattle,
    New York, and LA have a lot of jobs, but they are also some of the most expensive
    cities in the country! Even places such as Austin are much more expensive now
    than they once were, so you want to research the cost of housing (more than other

  zh: 现在，搬迁本身没有问题，尤其是在职业生涯的早期。从家乡搬到科技职位丰富的地方可能是有利的，公司也可以帮助你支付搬迁费用。不幸的是，套利是双向的，你可能会得到加薪，但生活成本的提高使你失去了获得的任何收益。如果你搬到一个生活成本更高的城市，甚至可能会变得负担更重！在科技圈里，这是一种危险的现象，因为像旧金山、西雅图、纽约和洛杉矶这样的城市拥有很多工作机会，但它们也是美国最昂贵的城市！即使像奥斯汀这样的地方现在也比以前贵得多，所以在比较城市时，你要特别关注住房成本（比其他指标更重要）。
- en: The best tip is to try to normalize your salary and adjust it for each city,
    using a website or calculator. That way, you can ask for a raise and any adjustments
    needed for cost-of-living differences and know exactly how much to ask for. As
    usual, data is king, and you can always use hard numbers and research to back
    up your claims. Recruiters will certainly say that they will pay a salary commensurate
    with experience, but they may be looking at the nationwide numbers, not a number
    that's been adjusted for the specific location being considered.

- en: Besides a base salary, you may want to negotiate in other areas of compensation,

    awards with a multiyear vesting schedule. Usually, you get a yearly amount, and
    they take 4 years to vest, so every year, you are simultaneously earning and vesting
    more. This is common in big tech companies (such as **Meta**, **Apple**, **Amazon**,
    **Netflix,** and **Google**) and when you get high enough on the career ladder

    In my experience, as both an interviewer and a candidate, trying to fill a role
    overly quickly is in no one's best interest. An expedited interview process may
    be a result of toxic company culture or poor planning, and it may result in an

- en: '**Email** is the only acceptable method when you''re following up with recruiters.
    Calling is not appropriate unless you have been given permission ahead of time.
    Email provides digital documentation of your correspondence as well. Some companies,
    especially those who receive a large volume of applications, ask applicants not
    to follow up; you should adhere to the company''s policies.'

- en: '**Respecting personal boundaries** is as simple as being professional. Recruiters
    are not looking for friends – they are on the hunt for top talent. First, I advise
    against adding recruiters to any non-professional social media such as Facebook.
    First-party recruiters work specifically for a company, not for you, which means
    they owe you nothing, not a response or follow-up, no matter how much you want
    one. For example, if you followed up more than once and they didn''t get back
    to you, then they are just not that interested, and it is time to move on.'

  zh: '**尊重个人边界**就像是保持专业一样简单。招聘人员并不是在寻找朋友——他们在寻找顶尖人才。首先，我建议不要将招聘人员添加到任何非专业社交媒体平台，如
    Facebook。第一方招聘人员专门为公司工作，而不是为你工作，这意味着他们对你没有任何义务，不需要回应或跟进，不管你多么渴望获得回应。例如，如果你多次跟进了，但他们没有回复，那么他们对你并不感兴趣，是时候继续前进了。'

- en: Having a professional profile that shares your experience and carefully highlights
    all your skills is supremely important. Your online profile is your calling card,
    so having the correct set of skills and experience can get you the type of contacts
    you want both from a networking perspective and for specific opportunities.

- en: You can be proactive with your search, and you can make it so that you can receive
    daily job hits based on your online profile. Make it a habit to quickly classify
    each job and put it in the right bucket. Contract gigs and salaried roles can
    vary wildly in responsibility and compensation, and you must make sure you know
    the answers you need before you start the interview process!

  zh: 你可以主动进行求职，并且可以让自己根据在线资料接收到每日的职位信息。养成快速分类每个职位并将其放入正确类别的习惯。合同职位和固定薪水的职位在职责和薪酬上可能差异巨大，因此在开始面试之前，你必须确保自己清楚需要了解的所有信息！
- en: Do your research, ask relevant questions, and read the job description to make
    sure you know what you are signing up for. The internet makes it easier than ever
    to apply for jobs, but blindly doing so may cost you more time down the line.
    Find out about their salary ranges, share your expectations, and determine whether
    they are in line. Ask about benefits, culture, remote work, and other forms of
    compensation, such as bonuses, equity, or stock.

  zh: 做好研究，提出相关问题，并阅读职位描述，确保你知道自己在签约什么。互联网让申请工作比以往任何时候都更加容易，但盲目申请可能会在之后浪费你更多时间。了解他们的薪资范围，分享你的期望，并确认它们是否一致。询问福利、企业文化、远程工作以及其他形式的补偿，如奖金、股权或股票。
- en: Be mindful of cost-of-living differences and realize that a dollar in San Francisco
    is worth less than a dollar in Boise. Ask companies about their relocation packages,
    salary adjustments, and ability to work remotely. Moving for a new job could prove
    to be a great career move, but you certainly don't want to do it at the expense
    of a lower quality of life.

- en: As far as recruiters are concerned, be frank, be direct, and try to not waste
    their time or yours. If an opportunity seems like a terrible job, don't interview
    just for the sake of it. Sure, getting interview practice is valuable, but it's
    better to do it with jobs you are genuinely interested in.

- en: Connect with recruiters who you enjoy working with, and feel free to network
    with people you meet in the interview process, including hiring managers. Some
    may not accept a request at that point because they are still in the interview
    process, but you may reach out after the fact and state you would like to connect
    regardless.
