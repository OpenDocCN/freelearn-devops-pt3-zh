    to product-centric models, transforming how organizations deliver value and respond
    to market demands. Mik Kersten’s book *Project to Product* drew significant attention
    to this change, offering a structured framework and practical guidance that solidified
    the concept.1 Building upon discussions within the Agile and DevOps communities,

    delaying projects and allowing coding errors and defects to accumulate, making

    a value stream across our organizational structures to better appreciate how work
    flows. But how do we define the value stream in the first place? Discovering a
    value stream involves a reverse journey from the customer outcome, inquiring about
    the processes and decisions that lead to the realization of that outcome. This
    backward journey often leads to the source of the process, which could be a customer
    request, a stakeholder’s need, or an output from another value stream.

    ensures that we stay aligned with their needs throughout the process. As we map
    the journey backward customer delivery upstream across our value stream flow to
    the initial order, we continuously inquire about the information and other product
    or service components that must be delivered at each stage of our value stream.
    This iterative approach guides us step by step, eventually leading us all the
    way back to the point of the initial customer order or request. It serves as a
