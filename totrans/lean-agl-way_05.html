			<p class="author-quote">Adopting V<a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>alue Stream Management is not just a step, but a journey towards continuous improvement to create an ever-evolving insights-driven culture.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Adapted from the VSM Consortium</p>
			<p>Previously, in <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, we introduced VSM as a methodology for prioritizing opportunities <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>using a Lean approach. This chapter explores the <strong class="bold">VSM Implementation Roadmap </strong>from the <strong class="bold">Value Stream Management Consortium </strong>(<strong class="bold">VSMC</strong>)<span class="superscript">1</span>. The VSMC promotes value stream methods and tools for <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>Lean-Agile enterprises, particularly in organizations heavily invested in digital technologies. They facilitate optimizing strategic investments and end-to-end operations, avoiding siloed decision-making. This road map enables the widespread deployment of the VSM methodology throughout your organization, leveraging both Lean and Agile concepts while aligning the technology departments to support the organization’s value stream <span class="No-Break">improvement activities.</span></p>
			<p>The VSM Implementation Roadmap comprises the following steps: <strong class="bold">start</strong>, <strong class="bold">assess</strong>, <strong class="bold">vision</strong>, <strong class="bold">identify</strong>, <strong class="bold">organize</strong>, <strong class="bold">map</strong>, <strong class="bold">connect</strong>, <strong class="bold">inspect</strong>, and <strong class="bold">adapt</strong>. It combines Lean and Agile practices, aligned with the fundamental principles of our book — <em class="italic">The </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Lean-Agile Way</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The VSM implementation roadmap goes across industry boundaries, ensuring holistic, end-to- end value stream assessments essential for achieving significant flow improvements <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>and avoiding <strong class="bold">local optimizations</strong>, common when systems thinking <span class="No-Break">is ignored.</span></p>
			<p>Mastery of the VSM implementation roadmap enables your organization to optimize value streams systematically, understand their complexities, and implement transformative change within <span class="No-Break">your enterprise.</span></p>
			<p>The following topics are covered in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introducing the VSM <span class="No-Break">implementation roadmap</span></li>
				<li>Exploring the nine steps of the VSM <span class="No-Break">implementation roadmap</span></li>

			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>Unveiling the VSM implementation roadmap</h1>
			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>explaining the purpose and the essential steps of the VSM implementation roadmap, it’s helpful to understand VSM’s history, which has paved the way for this modern approach <span class="No-Break">to implementation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor307"/>Learning from history</h2>
			<p>The concept of value streams has a substantial historical background, with numerous contributors <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>influencing its development. While we have come a long way, this history remains relevant as it helps us understand the necessity of today’s VSM implementation roadmap. So, before we go on, let’s take a look at some of the most impactful historical events in the evolution of Lean thinking <span class="No-Break">and practices.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Toyota’s</strong> <strong class="bold">early</strong> <strong class="bold">use</strong>: Toyota is credited with the early implementation of value stream concepts, using visual displays of production processes, known as <strong class="bold">material and information flow diagrams</strong>. However, controversy exists about when these concepts and tools were initially used at Toyota (<span class="No-Break">Baudin 2013).</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">2</span></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Womack and Jones</strong>: James Womack and Daniel Jones introduced the term “value stream” in the ‘<em class="italic">From Lean Production to the Lean Enterprise</em>’ Harvard Business Review article.<span class="superscript">3</span> It emphasized that value streams define the Lean enterprise and encompass all activities needed to deliver maximum <span class="No-Break">customer value.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">James Martin’s insight</strong>: James Martin, a highly respected figure in the computer industry, defined value streams in the context of a holistic practice he called ‘<em class="italic">Enterprise Engineering</em>’ (Martin 1994).<span class="superscript">4</span> Martin advocated against automating poorly designed business processes mapped to hierarchical management structures, which invariably cause siloes and inefficiencies across functional and <span class="No-Break">organizational workstreams.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Emergence of VSM books</strong>: In the early 2000s, books on VSM began to appear, with ‘<em class="italic">Value Stream Management: Strategy and Excellence in the Supply Chain</em>’ (Hines et al. 2000) as one of the earliest.<span class="superscript">5</span> This book described VSM as practices that enhance customer experiences and listed seven value stream <span class="No-Break">mapping tools.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Refining</strong> <strong class="bold">versus</strong> <strong class="bold">mapping</strong>: Subsequent books, including ‘<em class="italic">Learning to See</em>’ by Mike Rother and John Shook and ‘<em class="italic">Seeing the Whole Value Stream</em>’ by David Brunt, Jim Womack, Dan Jones, and Matthew Lovejoy, played a significant role in refining <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>value stream mapping techniques. <span class="superscript">6,7</span> These publications began incorporating Lean metrics to facilitate the discovery of constraints and waste affecting an organization’s end-to-end value <span class="No-Break">stream flows.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">VSM</strong> <strong class="bold">as</strong> <strong class="bold">a</strong> <strong class="bold">methodology</strong>: Books by Don Tapping and his co-authors further refined VSM as a methodology for continuous improvement using Lean principles and value <span class="No-Break">stream mapping.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">8</span></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Widespread</strong> <strong class="bold">adoption</strong>: Over time, the application of value stream improvement concepts expanded to various industries. Karen Martin and Mike Osterling’s book, ‘Value Stream Mapping: How to Visualize Work and Align Leadership for Organizational Transformation’ (Martin, Osterling 2013) significantly popularized <span class="No-Break">these ideas.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">9</span></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scope and internal value streams</strong>: Martin and Osterling further emphasized setting boundaries and limitations in value stream mapping to enable organizations to stay focused and promoted the idea of support-oriented value streams to map processes for internal activities such as HR, IT, Finance, <span class="No-Break">and Sales.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Several other important contributors have or are continuing to evolve modern VSM practices. However, this historical perspective offers a sufficient background to understand why modern VSM practices must incorporate Lean-Agile concepts and the primary reason for creating the VSM Implementation Roadmap. Also, the  Scaled Agile Framework has been a significant contributor to popularizing value stream concepts outside of the manufacturing domain and within <span class="No-Break">agile frameworks.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor308"/>Examining the need for a VSM roadmap</h2>
			<p>What we have learned so far is that value streams embody a Lean concept that has evolved <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>to address issues associated with the conventional practice of managing business processes within isolated silos designed to accommodate hierarchical organizational structures. Too often, these hierarchies have resulted in gross inefficiencies, political infighting for people, funding, and other resources, lack of focus on customer-centricity, and an inability to evaluate investments holistically, let alone from a customer-centric point <span class="No-Break">of view.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, value streams are centered on comprehending how organizations generate value from their customers’ perspectives, transcending organizational boundaries and self-interests. In essence, value streams define a seamless flow of work, materials, information, and resources that efficiently deliver value without being confined by organizational boundaries. The aim of value streams is to eliminate waste and constraints that often lead to product delays, increased costs, and <span class="No-Break">decreased quality.</span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, we explored how VSM emerged as a methodology designed to assist organizations in assessing their most critical improvements to value flow. As a methodology, VSM follows this <span class="No-Break">generalized pattern:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Teaching <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile concepts</span></li>
				<li>Identifying and prioritizing <span class="No-Break">value streams</span></li>
				<li>Defining an idealized value state <span class="No-Break">for benchmarking</span></li>
				<li>Utilizing current state value stream mapping through Gemba walks to uncover waste <span class="No-Break">and constraints</span></li>
				<li>Visualizing proposed value stream improvements through future state <span class="No-Break">value streams</span></li>
				<li>Developing Kaizen improvement plans that document recommended changes, including assessments of the current state , desired future state, gap analysis, ROI justifications, prioritization, and <span class="No-Break">alternative recommendations.</span></li>
				<li>Executing the Kaizen plan to achieve defined goals <span class="No-Break">and metrics</span></li>
				<li>Establishing a culture of continuous improvement <span class="No-Break">and transformation</span></li>
				<li>Stopping the continuous improvement process for a product or service when it reaches the end of its economically viable <span class="No-Break">life cycle</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This comprehensive approach ensures that organizations identify improvement opportunities <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>and execute and sustain these improvements as an integral part of their transformative business culture. However, with the advent of Agile methodologies, it becomes essential to rethink how the VSM methodology should integrate Lean and Agile practices. That is the subject of the <span class="No-Break">following section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>Exploring the VSM Implementation Roadmap</h2>
			<p>Embracing the Lean-Agile mindset, the VSMC’s approach to VSM is designed to enhance value <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>delivery through continuous improvement and <span class="No-Break">customer focus.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> illustrates the VSM implementation roadmap, which is a series of high-level steps guiding an organization adopting VSM ways of working. Each step establishes a foundation for the next, contributing to the evolution of an organization that practices VSM-led approaches, continually optimizing the customer experience, and illustrates the VSMC implementation roadmap, which is integral to the VSM methodology. While identifying and prioritizing continuous improvement, the VSM roadmap integrates <strong class="bold">inspect </strong>and <strong class="bold">adapt </strong>concepts from Agile. Inspecting and adapting enables continuous progress review and adaptation strategies based on new learning and market shifts. Each step of the roadmap brings us toward excellence in customer value delivery and satisfaction. It consists of the <span class="No-Break">following steps:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer053">
					<img alt="Figure 5.1 – VSM Implementation Roadmap graphic" src="image/B21818_05_1.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1 – VSM Implementation Roadmap graphic</p>
			<p>Although the roadmap presents the implementation steps as a linear flow, in reality, each step may occur iteratively based on feedback  and learning. The list that follows identifies the purpose of <span class="No-Break">each step.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start</strong>: Initiate VSM by setting the step for change and commitment, aligning the mission with <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile principles.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assess</strong>: Evaluate the current operational landscape (culture, capability, and context), baseline current performance, and establish a business case <span class="No-Break">for improvement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Vision</strong>: A compelling vision for the future inspires and motivates people to act, establishing a clear and strategic direction for value creation and visualizing the outcomes that will <span class="No-Break">drive success.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identify</strong>: Select a value stream to improve. Focus on customer value to identify the organization’s value streams. This can be challenging for project-centric organizations, as long-lived products, unlike short-lived projects, reveal value streams, with anything delivering a product <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>or service constituting a <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span><p class="list-inset">The first value stream to target for improvement is often the one that lies at the intersection of four criteria: strong leadership support, highly visible value stream, existing Agile teams, and a significant challenge <span class="No-Break">or opportunity.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organize</strong>: Systematically organize people, resources, and workflows around a product or service to optimize the flow of value for a product or service across functional departments, and the <span class="No-Break">entire system.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map</strong>: Assemble the VSM team, to identify and understand the current steps and activities involved in delivering value to the customer. Mapping helps identify bottlenecks, delays, and areas for improvement in the <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Connect</strong>: Integrate and connect people, processes, and tools within value streams that foster communication and teamwork. When work items can be traced throughout the entire value stream, delays, rework, and waste become visible. These insights drive improvements, and feedback <span class="No-Break">informs decision-making.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspect</strong>: Monitor performance by analyzing data, setting improvement goals, defining critical metrics, and leveraging automated data collection systems for accurate tracking. Continuous inspection, management, and improvement of flow and value realization are feasible only by making data and insights available from the digital <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adapt</strong>: Once you have data and insights to inform action, it’s time to implement changes. Encourage continuous, iterative refinements to adapt to change and proactively strive <span class="No-Break">for excellence.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>By adhering <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>to its structured approach, the VSMC roadmap streamlines operations and persistently aligns them with the overarching goal of delivering superior value to our customers. Each step offers a commitment to the Lean-Agile mindset, ensuring enterprises stay Agile, responsive, and customer- centric in our journey toward <span class="No-Break">operational excellence.</span></p>
			<p>We will further explore each <span class="No-Break">roadmap step.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Implementing Value Stream Management</h1>
			<p>According <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>to the VSMC, implementing VSM goes beyond operational improvements. It embodies efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic foresight. Consequently, this perspective is foundational for appreciating the nuances of their VSM implementation roadmap. The following sections provide a detailed overview of the nine <span class="No-Break">roadmap steps.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>1. Start – initiating value stream management</h2>
			<p>Your VSM <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>implementation journey begins with your current state, regardless of the maturity of your digital processes. At the core of each business are value streams and networks of value streams designed to fulfill customer needs or serve citizens (in government contexts). Organizations continuously innovate, develop, and deliver products or services regardless of their <span class="No-Break">profit orientation.</span></p>
			<p>Whenever there is a spark of innovation or a proposed change, it goes through design, development, and delivery before the customer can realize its value. Many organizations have long since adopted Agile methodologies, DevOps practices, or Lean principles. Others might be navigating through structural changes such as reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions. These factors do not prevent enterprises from adopting and driving the use of VSM methodologies and tools. Instead they strengthen the business case for change. However, leaders must be wary of the fatigue that comes with constant change. Clearly articulate the purpose and vision of the VSM implementation <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>and help knowledge workers understand how their work contributes to the organization’s overall goals and objectives.  A good purpose offers the why behind the change and motivates people to come along on the journey and to be actively engaged in <span class="No-Break">its success.</span></p>
			<p>The typical obstacles to adopting VSM are the absence of senior leadership endorsement and limited resources. Forward-thinking individuals should proceed with the intent to course-correct rather than wait for permission, bringing leaders along in the process. Proactive individuals recognize that perceived resource limitations are often alleviated when inefficiencies are eliminated, unlocking capacity within the system. Still, this proactive stance does not abdicate executives from their duties in transforming <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p>Jumping in front of a parade does not make you a leader. True leadership involves more than just being at the forefront. It requires vision, empathy, and the ability to inspire and guide others toward a common goal. A true leader listens, collaborates, and leads by example rather than merely seeking <span class="No-Break">the spotlight.</span></p>
			<p>Leaders earn the credibility and authority to steer the company forward through a hands-on approach and intimate knowledge of the organization’s inner workings. This involvement goes beyond leading change to being an integral part of the transformation, ensuring that the implementation of VSM is a <span class="No-Break">shared journey.</span></p>
			<p>While emphasizing the importance of leadership involvement, we do not advocate for a scenario where leaders direct all tasks or make every decision single-handedly. Such centralization can lead to detrimental outcomes, including decision-making bottlenecks, uninformed choices, and biases that contradict the actual dynamics of <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p>Effective leaders understand the value of delegation and place trust in their teams to handle the tactical, day-to-day decisions. Handing off decision-making is easier when the organization makes visible activities and critical metrics that define progress against goals and plans. This approach empowers employees, fosters a culture of accountability, and ensures that the organization’s direction is shaped by diverse insights and expertise, leading to a more robust and resilient <span class="No-Break">VSM implementation.</span></p>
			<p>The “<strong class="bold">Start</strong>” step of the VSM Implementation Roadmap involves the following primary activities, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.2</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer054">
					<img alt="Figure 5.2 – VSM starting activities" src="image/B21818_05_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2 – VSM starting activities</p>
			<p>These key <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>activities lay the foundation and set the direction for effective <span class="No-Break">VSM implementation:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assemble</strong> <strong class="bold">core teams</strong>: Creating a foundational team for VSM should bring together individuals with a wide range of expertise. Two types of teams <span class="No-Break">are recommended:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">VSM</strong> <strong class="bold">SME team</strong> – A small, specialized group of VSM <strong class="bold">subject</strong> <strong class="bold">matter</strong> <strong class="bold">experts</strong> (<strong class="bold">SMEs</strong>) who <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>facilitate, educate, and mentor throughout the organization’s various VSM initiatives. They are responsible for driving the VSM methodology and overseeing the implementation of VSMC <span class="No-Break">roadmap activities.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Value stream improvements team </strong>(<strong class="bold">VSIT</strong>) – This team has individuals actively <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>involved in enhancing the targeted value streams. They possess critical domain knowledge and play a vital role in implementing the concepts later outlined in <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Defining a Business Agility System for the Enterprise </em>(<em class="italic">BASE</em>), including establishing a rhythm to support the objectives of the <strong class="bold">minimum valuable increment </strong>(<strong class="bold">MVI</strong>). The composition of the VSIT is dynamic and may vary with <span class="No-Break">each MVI.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assess</strong> <strong class="bold">the</strong> <strong class="bold">current</strong> <strong class="bold">situation</strong>: This step requires an initial assessment of the current landscape. Immediate executive support is ideal, but if that’s not available, the goal is to generate momentum and gather the support and resources needed for the <span class="No-Break">VSM journey.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Set strategic direction</strong>: The focus here is to outline the strategic goals and objectives of the VSM initiative. This means considering how it supports the company’s broader strategic goals, enhances customer value, improves operational efficiency, and boosts overall <span class="No-Break">business performance.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These three ‘<strong class="bold">start</strong>’ activities offer several benefits to organizations. First, they establish the core resources necessary to kickstart a successful VSM initiative by forming specialized teams. Secondly, they provide a rapid assessment of the organization’s current status, bridging the gap between its existing state and the strategic goals required <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>to achieve the broader business strategies. Another benefit it provides is the alignment and direction needed to enable decentralized decision-making and execution, tapping into the collective intelligence <span class="No-Break">of teams.</span></p>
			<p>With these three critical activities completed, the VSM and VSIT teams embark upon the second VSM <span class="No-Break">step, ‘</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">assess</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.’</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor312"/>2. Assess – evaluating and baselining current performance</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Assess</strong>, the second <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>step in the VSM implementation roadmap, builds upon the ‘<strong class="bold">start</strong>’ step, and involves a comprehensive evaluation of existing VSM capabilities to establish baseline performance metrics and identify areas <span class="No-Break">for improvement.</span></p>
			<p>The VSMC developed a VSM assessment that is aligned with the implementation roadmap steps. It is designed to baseline the current state and for ongoing reassessment during your VSM implementation journey. This assessment phase emerged from collaborative efforts within the VSMC, underscoring the importance of benchmarking the current state at the beginning of the VSM journey and maintaining continuous <span class="No-Break">progress monitoring.</span></p>
			<p>The VSMC’s assessment tool utilizes a <strong class="bold">Likert</strong> scale questionnaire, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>, prompting respondents to rate their current state on a scale ranging from <strong class="bold">Strongly agree </strong>to <strong class="bold">Strongly disagree </strong>and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Not</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">applicable</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer055">
					<img alt="Figure 5.3 – Likert scale assessment" src="image/B21818_05_3.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.3 – Likert scale assessment</p>
			<p>Tailored for use by consultants and enterprise practitioners, this assessment tool is valuable for identifying focus areas, establishing a baseline for future measurement, and comparing performance against <span class="No-Break">industry benchmarks.</span></p>
			<p>Available <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>online as a self-service tool, the assessment <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>invites teams to respond to standardized questions – <strong class="bold">VSM</strong> <strong class="bold">Assessment</strong> (<a href="https://www.vsmconsortium.org/">vsmconsortium.org/vsm-assessment</a>). This tool aids in internal benchmarking and allows for a comparison with other teams and organizations. It starts with evaluating the organization’s vision and leadership support – key drivers of successful <span class="No-Break">VSM adoption.</span></p>
			<p>By leveraging this tool, teams can systematically uncover strengths and weaknesses in their approach, providing a clear, quantifiable measure of their VSM journey and identifying a path forward to elevate their value stream practices to <span class="No-Break">world-class standards.</span></p>
			<p>Having completed the thorough ‘<strong class="bold">assess</strong>’ phase, where current processes are evaluated, we now transition to the ‘<strong class="bold">vision</strong>’ step. Here, we shift our focus from understanding the current state of our value stream to defining our desired future <span class="No-Break">state vision.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>3. Vision – creating a unified vision and goals</h2>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">vision </strong>step, organizations must define and articulate a long-term vision and objectives that guide their transformation journey. This vision must be well understood and broadly <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>shared across the organization, becoming the new norm. Put simply, this is the way we do things around here. It’s not merely about fighting through existing systems, but evolving the organizational mindset and instilling new habits. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.4 </em>depicts the essential elements of the <span class="No-Break">vision step:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer056">
					<img alt="Figure 5.4 – Developing a shared vision" src="image/B21818_05_4.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4 – Developing a shared vision</p>
			<p>The vision reinforces an organization’s dedication to defining the seamless flow of valuable customer outcomes. It is a process where the organization envisions a future free from waste and unnecessary constraints, gains a deep understanding of customer experiences, and promptly acts on them, with each insight driving <span class="No-Break">tangible improvements.</span></p>
			<p>The goals associated with this vision are inherently united with enhancing organizational effectiveness, especially <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>critical in the <strong class="bold">digital for-profit sphere</strong>. These goals encompass high responsiveness to customer needs, transparency of work in process, empowering value stream autonomy, and achieving a competitive edge in the market. Measured improvement forms the foundation for these objectives, enabling tracking and optimizing delivery speed, customer impact, cost efficiency, and <span class="No-Break">market leadership.</span></p>
			<p>The goals of the vision step are designed to elevate organizational effectiveness by emphasizing agility, transparency, and adaptability to market dynamics. The objective is to promptly address customer needs, ensure clear and effective processes, and enable value streams to directly influence financial success. Goals must be aspirational and measurable using leading indicators. The SMART criteria discussed in <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><em class="italic"> </em>offer a structured approach for tracking business objectives <span class="No-Break">and metrics.</span></p>
			<p>Leading indicators enable tracking an organization’s proficiency in enacting changes swiftly, efficiently meeting customer demands, managing costs effectively, and sustaining competitive advantage within <span class="No-Break">its market.</span></p>
			<p>Executive leaders must embrace their role of setting the strategic course and empowering teams with strategic insight to actively engage in the transformation. It is a collaborative effort where goals are set, such as improving customer experience, reducing process waste, shortening feedback loops, and aligning with financial models. In <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Defining a Business Agility System for the Enterprise (BASE)</em>, we’ll discuss the use of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to help executives set <span class="No-Break">clear expectations.</span></p>
			<p>Each objective <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>is associated with quantifiable outcomes such as increased customer engagement, faster delivery of value, improved decision-making, and positive financial returns. By breaking down the vision into measurable targets, teams can pursue incremental progress, making the vision a tangible and <span class="No-Break">achievable reality.</span></p>
			<p>Having a clear vision lays the groundwork for transforming aspirations into measurable outcomes, propelling the organization forward on its VSM journey with a <span class="No-Break">shared direction.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>4. Identify – surfacing value streams</h2>
			<p>The goal of the <strong class="bold">identify</strong> step is to define and describe the value streams within an organization. Seeing value streams in a landscape often dominated by hierarchal organizational <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>structures and project-based thinking can present challenges. Unlike projects, which are temporary and finite, value streams represent the life cycle of a product or service, from inception to delivery and beyond. They are the sequences of activities required to transform an idea into a valuable outcome for <span class="No-Break">the customer.</span></p>
			<p>To illustrate, in the context of an e-commerce system for selling products, core value streams include the activities most critical to the mission of the organization, while supportive value streams include the platforms and CI/CD pipelines facilitating core value stream activities. We go further into classification methods for types of streams in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Part 3</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The identification process involves recognizing various products, services, platforms, and their respective internal or external customers. Each value stream has a starting point where an idea is generated and an endpoint where value is delivered to the customer. It is essential to map these value streams, understand where they intersect and support one another, and <span class="No-Break">identify dependencies.</span></p>
			<p>The goal is to take incremental steps toward improvement. Organizations can systematically unravel the complexities of their value streams by beginning with small-scale experiments and learning from them. The primary focus is on identifying and naming value-adding steps, identifying the customers they serve, and mapping out the entire journey from start to finish. Adopting this approach allows even the most intricate <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>systems to be effectively navigated and optimized <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<p>You may notice that the VSM implementation roadmap has Lean and Agile elements. In this context, we <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>utilize the <strong class="bold">iterative and incremental development </strong> process from Agile to identify opportunities for Lean-oriented improvements within the organization. During the ‘<strong class="bold">inspect</strong>’ and ‘<strong class="bold">adapt</strong>’ phases, we’ll revisit the concepts of iteration and incremental improvement. However, we still have more ground to cover as we move on to the next step – ‘<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">organize</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.’</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>5. Organize – streamlining cross-functional collaboration</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">organize </strong>step <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>acknowledges the shift from traditional siloed structures to a more integrated approach where technology teams are intrinsically aligned with the business. The evo<a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>lution from DevOps to a broader <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>inclusion of departments such as Finance, HR, Sales, Marketing, Product Management, and <strong class="bold">Governance, Risk and Compliance</strong> (<strong class="bold">GRC</strong>) highlights <span class="No-Break">this shift.</span></p>
			<p>The problems inherent in silos are significant. Handoffs between teams present risks of errors, delays, or lost opportunities. Moreover, organizational layers and disconnects can lead to misalignment with business intentions, resulting in slower delivery and reduced <span class="No-Break">customer satisfaction.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, core value streams must be seen as spanning the entire journey from concept to customer realization without artificially separating business and technology. Certain roles, such as portfolio managers, may not be dedicated to single value streams due to their overarching nature. Similarly, specialized roles such as release and cloud engineers may operate across multiple streams, possibly within a platform or <span class="No-Break">enabling teams.</span></p>
			<p>Many people, both internal and external to the organization, may care about the products and services we deliver. However, the ultimate stakeholder is the customer, and value streams should operate autonomously to <span class="No-Break">serve them.</span></p>
			<p>Although <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>roles are situated at specific points within the value chain, all roles should focus on the flow and realization of value within their respective streams rather than their mere contribution to <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></p>
			<p>The following considerations are vital to the ‘<span class="No-Break">organize’ step:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identification of VSM and cross-functional teams</strong>: Recognize the necessary roles and form teams that can operate across functional boundaries to improve the <span class="No-Break">value stream</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Definition of roles and responsibilities</strong>: Delineate what each team and its members are accountable for, ensuring that every role is geared toward enhancing the value provided to <span class="No-Break">the customer</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communication</strong>: Establish robust communication that facilitates seamless interaction and information sharing across <span class="No-Break">all teams</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Training</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">support</strong>: Provide comprehensive training and resources to teams, enabling them to fulfill their VSM <span class="No-Break">roles effectively</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">adjustment</strong>: Continuously monitor the performance of the value stream, ready to adjust team organization and dynamics to ensure optimal functioning and <span class="No-Break">value delivery</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By embracing these principles, organizations can create a cohesive environment that promotes efficiency, alignment, and customer-centricity, moving away from siloed operations toward a fully integrated digital <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<p>We are poised to move forward with the VSM teams in place to facilitate training, coaching, and mentoring of the cross-functional VSIT teams assembled. <em class="italic">Step 6</em>, ‘<strong class="bold">map</strong>,’ will examine the value stream mapping process, which equips teams to pinpoint areas <span class="No-Break">for enhancement.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>6. Map – visualizing process efficiency and opportunities</h2>
			<p>Building a <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>value stream <strong class="bold">map</strong> is a key step that offers a structured approach to analyzing and improving the flow of value. The process typically consists of the <span class="No-Break">following steps:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assemble your mapping team</strong>: This initial step involves gathering a cross-functional team whose members were identified earlier during the Organize step. This team will work collaboratively to create the value stream map, bringing together their diverse expertise <span class="No-Break">and perspectives.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define</strong> <strong class="bold">the</strong> <strong class="bold">scope</strong>: The scope of the mapping exercise must be clearly defined, establishing the boundaries of the value stream to be mapped. This includes setting the starting and ending points, typically from the initial customer request to the final <span class="No-Break">product delivery.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create the current state map</strong>: Working backward from value delivery to the initial customer request, the team visually represents the value stream’s current state, composed of each distinct process in the flow. This map serves as a baseline for identifying waste, bottlenecks, and areas for <span class="No-Break">potential improvement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gather</strong> <strong class="bold">process</strong> <strong class="bold">data</strong>: In this phase, the team collects relevant data for each process within the value stream. Important metrics include cycle times, value-added time to the initial customer request, work in process, wait times, and other metrics to understand the flow <span class="No-Break">and delays.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Analyze the map</strong>: The final step thoroughly analyzes the current state map. Team members are encouraged to share insights and perspectives on potential changes or optimizations. This collaborative review is designed to generate a shared understanding of the value stream and foster consensus on the next steps <span class="No-Break">for improvement.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Through these steps, the mapping process captures the current state of the value stream and serves as a springboard for continuous improvement. By involving a cross-functional team, the mapping exercise ensures consideration of all perspectives, leading to a more comprehensive and effective approach <span class="No-Break">to improvement.</span></p>
			<p>The VSMC’s approach to value stream mapping is consistent with modern Lean practices, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.5</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – Sample value stream map</p>
			<p>After <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>mapping the value stream, we’ll discuss the next phase, ‘<strong class="bold">connect</strong>.’ That is where we integrate people, processes, and tools within our value streams, enhancing effective communication, enabling collaboration, and anchoring decisions from <span class="No-Break">data-driven insights.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>7. Connect – orchestrating people, processes, and tools</h2>
			<p>Given our imperative to compete in the digital era, <strong class="bold">connect </strong>is pivotal for integrating the DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>toolchain into the value stream. The toolchain spans the entire life cycle of an idea, beginning with portfolio management <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>and progressing through the product backlog, <strong class="bold">continuous integration/ continuous deployment </strong>(<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>), release and environment management, and finally, the service desk. This comprehensive suite of tools is integral for tracking an idea from its origin to the realized value as perceived by the customer, allowing for a deep analysis of the <span class="No-Break">customer experience.</span></p>
			<p>Modern DevOps, CI/CD, and VSM tooling and platforms can be expensive. However, definable benefits can be substantial, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.6</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.6 – Capabilities delivered via VSM tool and platform connections</p>
			<p>The ‘<strong class="bold">connect</strong>’ activities are designed to create a seamless and efficient workflow by integrating <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>communication, technology, and feedback. Modern VSM tools and platforms provide the integration, visualization, and analysis capabilities to support the <span class="No-Break">connect phase.</span></p>
			<p>The following provides a brief overview of the <span class="No-Break">connect activities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define communication protocols</strong>: This activity involves establishing clear guidelines on how team members exchange information, ensuring that communication is consistent and effective across all value <span class="No-Break">stream levels.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrate technology and tools</strong>: This step combines various technology solutions and tools into a cohesive system that supports the value stream, enhancing the team’s ability to work cohesively <span class="No-Break">and efficiently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automate data collection</strong>: This activity aims to reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and provide a consistent and reliable data flow for analysis <span class="No-Break">and decision-making.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enable real-time visibility</strong>: This involves setting up systems that provide immediate insight into the value stream’s performance, allowing for prompt identification of issues and opportunities <span class="No-Break">for improvement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Establish feedback loops</strong>: Creating feedback loops supports continuous learning and improvement, enabling the value stream to adapt and evolve based on the insights gathered from the team’s experiences and the <span class="No-Break">data collected.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of these <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>activities plays a vital role in connecting the various elements of the digital value stream, ensuring that the process is as efficient and responsive <span class="No-Break">as possible.</span></p>
			<p>Tracing work items throughout the entire value stream is a powerful capability provided by the tools shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em>. They illuminate delays, rework, and any waste that occurs along the way. The insights gathered can inform improvements by making these elements visible, while the feedback drives <span class="No-Break">informed decision-making.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, connecting people, processes, and tools creates a cohesive, transparent workflow where every action and outcome can be traced back to its source. It ensures the team is aligned, learning from real-time data, and continuously adapting to optimize the value stream. This connection phase is not just a step but an ongoing practice that underpins a culture of efficiency and <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>8. Inspect – using the Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycle to improve value streams</h2>
			<p>Value streams <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>originated with Lean, but W. Edwards Deming’s Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) guidance provided a significant foundation. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>we recommend using the <strong class="bold">PDSA cycle</strong> he popularized to improve our understanding of <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>PDSA goes beyond simple “inspect and adapt.” It uses evidence-based decision-making, which avoids speculation in favor of empiricism while using validated theory. This process takes us ahead of preconceived notions found in <span class="No-Break">traditional methods.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Plan</strong>: Before we do something, we need a hypothesis and a plan. The timeframe for planning can vary from minutes to days. The plan sets an expectation of what we think will happen. This tests our understanding of the situation and how well it works. It provides a baseline to see how well we understood the <span class="No-Break">current situation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Do</strong>: This is where we execute the plan’s activities. However, if evidence proves things are not going as expected, we refine the plan to reflect on our new understanding of the situation. The Deming PDSA cycle applies continuous learning for a <span class="No-Break">planned timebox.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Study</strong>: We use fast feedback to determine whether what is happening (or “Do”) matches what we expected (our “Plan”). This feedback loop can be continuous or conducted at the end of the planned increment. Looking at the disparity <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>between plan and do, we can pivot and challenge our understanding. In other words, we study to ensure we are building the right product in the right way while making sure we are also <span class="No-Break">thinking correctly.</span><p class="list-inset">This <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>process is called <strong class="bold">double-loop learning</strong>. <strong class="bold">Single-loop learning </strong>is about getting better at what you are doing. Double loop <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>learning challenges the “what you are doing” to see whether there is a better way to work and whether what you’re working on is correct. Any process that doesn’t allow you to change its practices effectively limits <span class="No-Break">double-loop learning.</span></p><p class="list-inset"><strong class="bold">Triple-loop learning </strong>is about <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>learning how to learn. Triple-loop learning teaches us how to challenge our assumptions. The article on double-loop learning by Chris Argyris at <a href="https://infed.org/mobi/chris-argyris-theories-of-action-double-loop-learning-and-organizational-learning/">https://infed.org/mobi/chris-argyris-theories-of-action-double-loop-learning-and-organizational-learning/</a> offers greater detail on <span class="No-Break">this topic.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Act:</strong> After the “Study” phase, our focus turns to producing what we are building by following our plan while improving our understanding of the model we used to develop <span class="No-Break">the plan.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The VSMC advocates for inspecting value along two <span class="No-Break">principal dimensions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flow</strong>: Ensuring the work travels smoothly from conception to delivery, representing a consistent delivery of value <span class="No-Break">to customers</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value</strong>: Actualization of the desired business outcomes, where customers experience the <span class="No-Break">intended value</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These dimensions <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>help the organization assess the health of the value stream and the customer experience to assess efficiency <span class="No-Break">and effectiveness.</span></p>
			<p>The ‘<strong class="bold">inspect</strong>’ phase allows <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>us to focus on analyzing and enhancing the performance of value streams. This involves a series of strategic actions aimed at understanding and improving the various facets of the value stream processes. Here are <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>the key activities that drive <span class="No-Break">this phase:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define</strong> <strong class="bold">relevant</strong> <strong class="bold">metrics</strong>: Define essential performance indicators for your value streams, such as lead time, cycle time, throughput, ongoing work, and <span class="No-Break">defect rates.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leverage automated data collection</strong>: Use real-time data from DevOps tools to analyze performance and understand the true progress of work. For example, developers mark work as ‘<strong class="bold">Done</strong>’ in a Kanban system, but the completed work from the story may sit in another team’s release queue for months. DevOps tools and data present a more accurate view, basing metrics on the <span class="No-Break">end-to-end process.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitor performance</strong>: Keep a constant watch on your value stream’s performance by analyzing real-time data and insights from DevOps tools to prevent service disruptions. Teams must continuously monitor system attributes such as security, reliability, performance, scalability, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Analyze</strong> <strong class="bold">the</strong> <strong class="bold">data</strong>: Examine the data collected to assess how well your processes work and spot areas needing refinement, including business outcomes for products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Set</strong> <strong class="bold">experimental</strong> <strong class="bold">improvement</strong> <strong class="bold">goals</strong>: Craft targeted goals for experimental improvements to boost your value stream performance based on thorough <span class="No-Break">data analysis.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Maintaining a smooth flow of work and achieving desired business outcomes necessitates a vigilant and proactive approach to management and refinement. The wealth of data and insights in the digital value stream provides the mechanisms that teams need to sustain a perpetual cycle of inspection <span class="No-Break">and adaptation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>9. Adapt – communicate, scope, and plan interventions</h2>
			<p>The Adapt <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>phase represents the culmination of the VSMC’s VSM implementation roadmap, where insights and data converge to prompt actionable change. Here, the focus shifts to implementing and iterating on changes that emerge from the <strong class="bold">Inspect</strong> phase. This phase is characterized by seven key actions, each aimed at evolving and refining the <span class="No-Break">value stream:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Embrace continuous improvement</strong>: Commit to relentless improvement, always seeking ways to enhance the <span class="No-Break">value stream</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Eliminate</strong> <strong class="bold">waste</strong>: Identify and remove inefficiencies to streamline processes and <span class="No-Break">maximize value</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Measure</strong> <strong class="bold">results and</strong> <strong class="bold">iterate</strong>: Evaluate the outcomes of changes and make iterative adjustments to ensure <span class="No-Break">continuous progress</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fine-tune processes</strong>: Adjust and optimize existing procedures for greater effectiveness <span class="No-Break">and efficiency</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automate workflows</strong>: Implement automation to reduce manual effort and increase consistency <span class="No-Break">and speed</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Share</strong> <strong class="bold">good</strong> <strong class="bold">practices</strong>: Cultivate and apply successful patterns and techniques across the enterprise’s <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Foster a culture of adaptation</strong>: Nurture an environment where flexibility and change are embraced across the organization to <span class="No-Break">drive improvement</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These adapt activities are not isolated efforts. They represent a cohesive approach to adaptation that is integral to the VSM life cycle. The inspect and adapt steps are intrinsically connected, feeding into each other in a continuous loop that reflects the Agile principles of iterative and incremental development. Through this agile-based approach, collaborating teams ensure the value streams are optimized, resilient, and responsive <span class="No-Break">to change.</span></p>
			<p>The ‘<strong class="bold">adapt</strong>’ stage is also about leveraging your value stream map as a communication tool to outline, scope, and coordinate the necessary changes. It is a strategic phase where you formulate and document hypotheses on the potential impact of changes and develop a clear, structured roadmap detailing immediate actions, next steps, and <span class="No-Break">future considerations.</span></p>
			<p>It is essential <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>to acknowledge that each change in the value chain carries the potential for unintended consequences. A value stream does not operate in isolation; a systems-thinking approach is indispensable for a comprehensive understanding and <span class="No-Break">effective management.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.7 </em>illustrates a structured approach to developing and refining hypotheses for adaptation, ensuring alignment with the intended vision while celebrating the milestones achieved along <span class="No-Break">the way:</span></p>

			<p>As change occurs, the value stream map becomes a living document, highlighting enhancements and redefining the current state. This is where the iterative nature of Agile adaptation shines, providing continuous improvement and a perpetual cycle of development <span class="No-Break">and enhancement.</span></p>
			<p>In our digital era, the VSM inspect step helps VSIT teams find opportunities to use digital advancements to improve areas that challenge the organization’s usual methods. Once insights and data are gathered, it is crucial to implement changes, which is the main focus of the VSM <span class="No-Break">adapt step.</span></p>
			<p>Value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>mapping can draw attention to improvements and redefine the current state. It is essential to recognize that once actions are taken, the map should evolve to avoid future misunderstandings <span class="No-Break">and misalignment.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Comparing VSM methodology and the VSM implementation roadmap</h1>
			<p>At first glance, the E9 VSM methodology and the VSMC’s implementation roadmap appear <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>to have similar processes, goals, and objectives. They both have nine steps, and some have similar names. But their areas of focus differ. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.8</em> and <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em> compares the two and illustrates the critical differences <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>we will explore in <span class="No-Break">this section:</span></p>
			<p>The VSM methodology has a history of over twenty years, and in our E9 VSM model, comprises a structured set of nine steps, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.8</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.9 – VSMC implementation roadmap</p>
			<p>While both roadmaps share similarities in processes, goals, and objectives, critical differences exist. The VSM Methodology is a proven Lean-oriented approach to drive improvements in productivity, efficiencies, and quality in any type of value stream. In contrast, the design of the VSMC implementation roadmap modernizes the VSM approach to support competitiveness and provide value-added services in the digital age. Moreover, the VSMC’s roadmap instills Agile’s iterative concepts for inspection <span class="No-Break">and adaptation.</span></p>
			<p>It is <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>not a matter of choosing <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>one approach over the other. Both serve the purpose of enhancing value streams, but they have <span class="No-Break">distinct roles:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">VSM methodology </strong>assists organizations in identifying and prioritizing value <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>stream improvements that span organizational boundaries. Specifically, it enables collaborating teams to assess and evaluate cross-functional and cross- departmental change opportunities, ensuring that improvements deliver the most impactful customer-centric value with the <span class="No-Break">available resources.</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">VSM implementation roadmap </strong>incorporates Agile’s inspect and adapt steps <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>to improve agility. This roadmap also aligns the activities of the IT organization, driving digital enhancements across the organization’s products and processes. It focuses on creating IT infrastructure to support digital improvements and <span class="No-Break">enhance competitiveness.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Together, these approaches complement each other, ensuring that the value stream improvement teams effectively address the broader organizational improvements and the IT-specific <span class="No-Break">digital enhancements.</span></p>
			<p>While IT organizations can improve their development and delivery services in isolation, they must align with the broader organization’s improvement needs. The VSM roadmap assists in identifying areas where digital enhancements are vital, ensuring that IT effectively supports the organization’s end-to-end value streams for core products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>

				<li>The primary objective of step 3, “<strong class="bold">Vision</strong>” step is to define a long-term vision and objectives that evolve the organizational mindset, ingraining new habits and aligning with measurable goals to enhance effectiveness and competitive edge in the digital, <span class="No-Break">for-profit sphere.</span></li>
				<li>In the context of step 4, “<strong class="bold">Identify</strong>” Core value streams directly deliver an organization’s core products and services, while supportive value streams enable and support these core functions, such as development platforms or customer relationship <span class="No-Break">management systems.</span></li>
				<li>Effective implementation of VSM step 5, “<strong class="bold">Organize</strong>” requires identifying VSM and cross- functional teams, defining roles and responsibilities, establishing communication pathways, providing training and support, and continuousl<a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>y monitoring and adjusting for optimal value stream functioning <span class="No-Break">and delivery.</span></li>
				<li>In step 6, “<strong class="bold">Map</strong>,” the five steps involved in the value stream mapping process are assembling the mapping team, defining the scope, gathering process data, creating the current state map, and analyzing the map to identify <span class="No-Break">improvement opportunities.</span></li>
				<li>The primary activities of step 7, “<strong class="bold">Connect</strong>,” include defining communication protocols, integrating technology and tools, automating data collection, enabling real-time visibility, and establishing feedback loops to create a seamless, efficient, and responsive digital value <span class="No-Break">stream workflow.</span></li>
				<li>The three pillars of empiricism in step 8, “<strong class="bold">Inspect</strong>” are transparency, inspection, and adaptation, contributing to value stream performance enhancement by promoting trust, encouraging continuous feedback, and guiding iterative improvements based on factual and <span class="No-Break">evidence-based decision-making.</span></li>
				<li>The seven key actions of step 9, “<strong class="bold">Adapt</strong>” are measuring results and iterating, embracing continuous improvement, eliminating waste, fine-tuning processes, automating workflows, sharing good practices, and fostering a culture of adaptation to evolve and refine the <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></li>
				<li>The key differences between the VSM methodology and the VSMC’s Implementation Roadmap are the modernized approach of the latter to enhance competitiveness in the digital age. The VSMC’s roadmap incorporates Lean and Agile concepts, and focuses on IT infrastructure and digital enhancements. The VSM methodology remains valuable for broad, organizational <a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>improvements and <span class="No-Break">cross-departmental changes.</span></li>
