    demand for the role of DevOps engineer has blossomed. This way of thinking focuses
    on shrinking the bottlenecks between IT operations and software development, having
    its origins in lean manufacturing concepts.

- en: By embracing DevOps release management, software development teams benefit from
    incorporating quality checks and shifting left, by moving testing, automation,
    and QA procedures much earlier into the software development life cycle. However,
    release management still requires monitoring applications and infrastructure components,
    in addition to managing change orders and schedules.

    release management is, how it is unique, and basic strategies to implement it.
    You will be shown how CI/CD pipelines enforce good DevOps release management and
    learn techniques to optimize them. Lastly, you will learn how to create a culture
    of cross-functional product development that reduces waste and increases value
    to the customer. Because of its usefulness in removing silos that isolate team
    members, DevOps release management is emerging as the most popular strategy currently
    being adopted.

    Life Cycle** (**SDLC**) and why it is so important. Then, we’ll briefly introduce
    you to Release Management and the common Release Management Life Cycle phases.
    Next, we’ll dive in to discover how various SDLC Release Management models work.
    Although this book is concerned with DevOps Release Management, it is crucial
    to understand the SDLC first, how it relates to Release Management, and where
    both fit into the overall project management landscape.
