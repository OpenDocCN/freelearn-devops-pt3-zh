			<p>20 years ago, on June 1, 2001, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said the following in an interview with the Chicago Sunday Times:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">"<em class="italic">Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</em>"<em class="italic"> </em></p>
			<p class="author-quote"><em class="italic">(Greene T. C. (2001))</em></p>
			<p>His concern was not only <strong class="bold">Linux</strong> but <strong class="bold">open source</strong> licenses in general. Now, 20 years later, Microsoft is the single largest contributor to open source in the world, beating Facebook, Google, Red Hat, and SUSE. Not only do they have many open source products, such as PowerShell, Visual Studio Code, and .NET, they also ship a complete Linux kernel with Windows 10 so that you can run any distribution on it. Microsoft president Brad Smith admits that "<em class="italic">Microsoft was on the wrong side of history when open source exploded at the beginning of the century</em>" (<em class="italic">Warren T. (2020)</em>).</p>
			<p>If you look at the top 10 companies that contribute to open source, you will find all the big tech companies that make commercial software:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>History of free and open source software</h1>
			<p>To understand open source, we must go back to the early days of computer science.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Public domain software</h2>
			<p>During the 1950s and 1960s, the price of software was low compared to the necessary hardware. Any<a id="_idIndexMarker332"/> software that was produced was mainly produced by academics and corporate research teams. It was normal for the source code to be distributed with the software – normally as <strong class="bold">public domain software</strong>. This means that the software is freely available without ownership, copyright, trademark, or patent. These principles of openness and cooperation had a great influence on <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>the <strong class="bold">hacker culture</strong> at that time.</p>
			<p>In the late 1960s, the rise of operating systems and compilers increased the costs of software. This was driven by a growing software industry that competed with hardware vendors that bundled their software together with their hardware.</p>
			<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, it became common to sell licenses for the use of software and in 1983, IBM stopped distributing their source code together with purchased software. Other software vendors followed their example.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Free software</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Richard Stallman</em> was<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> convinced that this is ethically wrong, and he founded the <strong class="bold">GNU Project</strong> in 1983 and, shortly later, the <strong class="bold">free software movement</strong>. The<a id="_idIndexMarker335"/> free software movement believes that software is considered free if the receiver of the software is allowed to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Run the program for any purpose.</li>
				<li>Study the software and change it in any way.</li>
				<li>Redistribute the program and make copies of it.</li>
				<li>Improve the software and release the improvements.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Richard founded <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>the <strong class="bold">Free Software Foundation</strong> (<strong class="bold">FSF</strong>) in 1985. The FSF is famous for the following saying:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">"<em class="italic">Free as in free speech – not free as in free beer.</em>"</p>
			<p>This means that the word <em class="italic">free</em> means freedom to distribute and not freedom from cost (<em class="italic">Gratis versus libre</em>). Since much of the free software already was free of charge, such gratis software (Freeware) became associated with free software and zero cost.</p>
			<p>The free software movement created a concept <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>called <strong class="bold">copyleft</strong>. This grants users the right to use and modify the software, but it preserves the free status of the software. Examples<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> of these licenses<a id="_idIndexMarker339"/> include the GNU <strong class="bold">General Public License</strong> (<strong class="bold">GPL</strong>), the Apache License, and the <strong class="bold">Mozilla Public License</strong> (<strong class="bold">MPL</strong>).</p>
			<p>Most of the great software that still runs today on<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> millions of devices has been distributed with those copyleft licenses; for example, the <strong class="bold">Linux kernel</strong> (published 1992 by <em class="italic">Linus Torvalds</em>), BSD, MySQL, and Apache.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Open source software</h2>
			<p>In May 1997, at the<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> Linux congress in Würzburg, Germany, <em class="italic">Eric Raymond</em> introduced his paper <em class="italic">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em> (<em class="italic">Raymond, E. S. 1999</em>). He reflected on free software principles and the hacker culture and the benefits for software development. The paper received a lot of attention and motivated Netscape to release its browser, <strong class="bold">Netscape Communicator</strong>, as free software.</p>
			<p>Raymond and others wanted to bring free software principles to more commercial software vendors, but the term <em class="italic">free software</em> had a negative connotation for commercial software companies.</p>
			<p>On February 3, 1998, in Palo Alto, many important people from the free software movement met for a strategy session to discuss the future of free software. Among the participants were <em class="italic">Eric Raymond</em>, <em class="italic">Michael Tiemann</em>, and <em class="italic">Christine Peterson</em>, who are credited with proposing the term <strong class="bold">open source</strong> in favor of free software.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Open Source Initiative</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSI</strong>) was<a id="_idIndexMarker342"/> founded by <em class="italic">Eric Raymond</em> and <em class="italic">Bruce Perens</em> in late February 1998, with Raymond as the first president (<em class="italic">OSI 2018</em>).</p>
			<p>In 1998, at publisher <em class="italic">Tim O'Reilly's</em> historical <em class="italic">Freeware Summit</em> – later named <em class="italic">Open Source Summit</em> – the term was swiftly adopted by early supports such as <em class="italic">Linus Torvalds</em>, <em class="italic">Larry Wall</em> (creator of Perl), <em class="italic">Brian Behlendorf</em> (Apache), <em class="italic">Eric Allman</em> (Sendmail), <em class="italic">Guido van Rossum</em> (Python), and <em class="italic">Phil Zimmerman</em> (PGP) (<em class="italic">O'Reilly</em><em class="italic"> 1998</em>).</p>
			<p>But <em class="italic">Richard Stallman</em> and the FSF rejected the new term <em class="italic">open source</em> (<em class="italic">Richard S. 2021</em>). That's why<a id="_idIndexMarker343"/> the <strong class="bold">Free Open Source Software</strong> (<strong class="bold">FOSS</strong>) movement is divided and still uses different terminology today.</p>
			<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, in the dotcom bubble, the terms <strong class="bold">open source</strong> and <strong class="bold">open source software</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSS</strong>) were widely adopted by the public media and ended up as the more popular terms.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>The rise of open source software</h2>
			<p>In the last two <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>decades, open source has continuously increased in popularity. Software such as Linux and Apache drives most of the internet. In the beginning, it was hard to commercialize OSS. The first idea was to provide enterprise-scale support services around the open source products. The companies that had success with this were Red Hat and MySQL. But it was much harder and didn't have the scale that commercial licensing provided. So, the open source companies that invested heavily in building OSS started to create <strong class="bold">open core</strong> products: a free, open source core product, as well as commercial add-ons, that could be bought by their customers.</p>
			<p>The transition of the software business model from classical licenses to <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) subscriptions <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>helped the open source companies commercialize their OSS. This motivated traditional software vendors to release their software – at least the core – as open source to engage with the community.</p>
			<p>Not only did the big software companies such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Amazon become big open source companies. Pure open source companies such as Red Hat and MuleSoft have also gained a lot of worth and market recognition. Red Hat, for example, was acquired by IBM in 2018 for 32 billion US dollars. MuleSoft was acquired in the same year by Salesforce for $6.5 billion.</p>
			<p>So, open source today is not from the revolutionary minds that create alternative, free software. Most of the top-notch software that fuels the software and platform services of the cloud providers is open source software (<em class="italic">Volpi M. 2019</em>).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>The difference between open source and open development</h1>
			<p>So, OSS refers to computer programs is released under a license that grants users the rights to use, study, modify, and share the software and its source code.</p>
			<p>But putting <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>your source code in the public under a copyleft license is just the first step. If a company wants to have all the benefits of open source, it must adopt the open source values, which leads to something that is called <strong class="bold">open development</strong> or <strong class="bold">development in the open</strong>. This means that you do not just give access to the source code. Instead, you must make the entire development and product management transparent. This includes the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Requirements</li>
				<li>Architecture and research</li>
				<li>Meetings</li>
				<li>Standards</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The .NET team is a good example of a team that hosts their community standup on Twitch and YouTube (see <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/live/community-standup">https://dotnet.microsoft.com/live/community-standup</a>).</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Open development</strong> also means creating an open and inclusive environment in which everyone feels safe to propose changes. This includes a strong code of ethics and a clean code base with a high degree of automation that allows everyone to quickly and easily contribute.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Benefits of embracing open source for companies</h1>
			<p>So, how is <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>open source connected to better development performance and how can your company benefit from a good open source strategy?</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Deliver faster with open source software</h2>
			<p>Depending on the sources, new products already consist of 70% to 90% open source code. This means that you will write 70% to 90% less code yourself, which can increase your time to <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>market significantly.</p>
			<p>Besides reusing open source code in your product, a lot of platform tooling is available as open source. Reusable GitHub Actions, test tooling, or container orchestration… the most efficient and robust tooling you can use to deliver software faster is, in most cases, open source software.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Build better products by engaging the community</h2>
			<p>If you develop some parts of your products in the open, you can leverage the hive mind of the community to build better and more secure software. It also helps you get early feedback on what you are doing from great engineers around the world.</p>
			<p>Especially for complicated, critical, and security-relevant software, engaging with the community often results in better solutions:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">"<em class="italic">The bigger the problem, the more open source developers are drawn, like magnets, to work on it.</em>"<em class="italic"> </em></p>
			<p class="author-quote"><em class="italic">(Ahlawat P., Boyne J., Herz D., Schmieg F., &amp; Stephan M. (2021))</em></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Use tools with a lower risk of obsolescence</h2>
			<p>Using open source can reduce the risk that a tool becomes obsolete. If you build tools yourself, you must maintain them yourself – which is not your priority. Using tools from small vendors or having them built by partners introduces the risk that the tools do not get maintained or the partner goes out of the market. Investing in open source tools instead can significantly reduce these risks. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Attract talent</h2>
			<p>Giving your engineers the ability to leverage open source in their work and contribute to open source projects during their work hours can have a significant impact on your hiring abilities. Being engaged in the community and playing a part in open source will help you attract talent.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Influence emerging technologies and standards</h2>
			<p>Many emerging technologies and standards are developed in the open. Contributing to these initiatives <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>gives your company the ability to influence these technologies and be a part of bleeding-edge development.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Improve your process by learning from open source projects</h2>
			<p>And, of course, if you embrace open source, your company can learn about collaborative development and apply these principles to improve the cross-team collaboration inside your<a id="_idIndexMarker350"/> company (called <strong class="bold">inner source</strong>).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Implementing an open source strategy</h1>
			<p>But with all <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>the benefits of embracing open source, there also are some risks you must address. You must be careful and be license-compliant when you use open source software in your products and toolchains. You must also take on the liability yourself if the open source component causes damage as you don't have a vendor you can sue. Also, there are risks involved if you take on too many dependencies – direct or indirect – and one of them breaks.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In <a href="B17827_14_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Securing Your Code</em>, you'll learn how 11 lines of code in a package and a conflict about a name caused severe damage and took off big parts of the internet.</p>
			<p>That's why your company should set up an <strong class="bold">open source strategy</strong>. This strategy should define what types of open source software developers can use for what purpose. There might be different rules for different purposes. If you want to include open source in your products, you will need some kind of governance to manage the associated risks.</p>
			<p>The strategy should also define whether developers are allowed to contribute to open source during work time and what the conditions are for that.</p>
			<p>I will not dig deeper into the details of the strategy. It depends a lot on how you plan to use open source and how you develop and release your products. Just make sure your company has a document for your open source strategy – even if it is small. It will evolve as the maturity and experience of open source will grow.</p>
			<p>One<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> recommendation is to implement a center or a community of excellence that helps you develop a strategy that developers can turn to if they have questions or are unsure of whether an open source component is compliant (<em class="italic">Ahlawat P., Boyne J., Herz D., Schmieg F., &amp; Stephan M. 2021</em>).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Open and inner source</h1>
			<p>The success of open source lies in its open and collaborative culture. Getting the right people to voluntarily collaborate over a big distance asynchronously can help solve a problem in the best way possible. The<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> principles are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Open collaboration</li>
				<li>Open communication</li>
				<li>Code reviews</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Applying these <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>principles to proprietary software within an organization is called <strong class="bold">inner source</strong>. This term is credited to Tim O'Reilly from 2000. Inner source can be a great way to break down silos and foster strong collaboration across teams and products.</p>
			<p>But like <strong class="bold">open source</strong> and <strong class="bold">open development</strong>, just making your code available is not sufficient to create an inner source culture. Many <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>success factors influence whether the inner source approach can succeed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Modular product architecture</strong>: If you have a big, monolithic architecture, this will keep people from contributing. Also, the quality of the code, the documentation, and how fast you can understand the code and contribute have a big influence on how inner source is adopted.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Standardized tools and processes</strong>: If every team has a toolchain and workflows, it will also exclude other engineers from contributing. Having a common engineering system and similar approaches for branching and CI/CD will help others focus on the problems and not be hindered by having to learn other tools and workflows first.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Autonomy and self-organization</strong>: So long as your organization pushes requirements to your teams and the engineers are busy keeping to their deadlines, contributions to other teams will not happen. Only if the teams can prioritize autonomously and work in a self-organized fashion will they have the freedom to participate in other communities – both open and inner source.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Inner source can <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>help break down silos and increase your engineering velocity. But it is also related to a high level of DevOps maturity. Inner source is something that evolves together with your increased DevOps capabilities and open source maturity. So, treat it as an output rather than an input to your acceleration.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Technically, inner source is normally done by activating forking in your enterprise. This goes hand in hand with your branching workflows, which we'll cover in <a href="B17827_11_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor249"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Trunk-Based Development</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>The importance of insourcing</h1>
			<p>Many companies do not see software development as their core business, so they tend to outsource it. <strong class="bold">Outsourcing</strong> means <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>one company hiring another company or freelancer to perform a specific function. Outsourcing is usually not a bad idea: you have another company that is specialized in one thing do the work for you so that you can put your people and investments in your core products. The specialized company normally does things cheaper and better – and building up these skills yourself can take a lot of time and money.</p>
			<p>But now, software<a id="_idIndexMarker358"/> is the key differentiator for basically all products. Not only the digital customer experience but also smart manufacturing or supply chain management can give you a competitive advantage. Custom software is becoming part of your core business. Due to this, many companies already have an <strong class="bold">insourcing</strong> strategy for software development – that is, recruiting and employing software developers and DevOps engineers in-house.</p>
			<p>The problem is that the market for software developers and DevOps engineers is highly competitive (the so-called <strong class="bold">war for talent</strong>). This<a id="_idIndexMarker359"/> often leads to a scattered landscape where partners work on core products and the developers maintain tooling.</p>
			<p>A good insourcing strategy is to ask yourself whether the software is core to your business – that is, whether it gives you a<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> competitive advantage:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Core software</strong> should<a id="_idIndexMarker361"/> be developed by internal developers. If you can't hire enough skilled developers, you can <strong class="bold">co-source</strong> and augment your staff with the engineers of one of your trusted partners. But the goal should always be to replace these developers with your engineers later.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Supplementary software</strong> can <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>be outsourced. In the best case, you can use an already existing product for it. If there is no such product, you can have a partner build it. And here is where <strong class="bold">open source</strong> comes into play: you can leverage existing open source solutions or have your partner build the solution in the open. This reduces the risk of you being the only customer and the solution becoming obsolete. Since the software is only supplementary to your business, you don't care if other companies also use it. The contrary is that the more your software is used, the smaller the risk of the software becoming obsolete. Also, the quality is reliable if the software is developed in the open.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Paying other companies or individuals to develop special open source software for you or adding features to existing open source solutions is not very common. But with more and more companies having an insourcing strategy and the continuing war for talent, this will significantly increase over the next few years.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>GitHub Sponsors</h1>
			<p>An <strong class="bold">open source strategy</strong> seems <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>to conflict with an <strong class="bold">insourcing strategy</strong> at first. But the matter is more complex. It might be more useful to the core software to contribute a small feature to an open source project than to implement a workaround yourself. But in many companies, the <strong class="bold">make-or-buy decision</strong> at a team level is always decided in favor of making because the process of buying or funding something with money is too complex. A good insourcing strategy should always include a lightweight and fast process with some budget to invest in tools and the software supply chain. If your company is low on in-house developers, buying software or sponsoring open source contributors should be no problem.</p>
			<p>A good way <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>to give your teams the ability to invest in open source projects is by utilizing a feature called <strong class="bold">GitHub Sponsors</strong>. It allows you to invest in the projects your product <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>depends on (your <strong class="bold">software supply chain</strong>) and keeps those projects alive. It can also give the maintainers freedom to write <strong class="bold">newly requested features</strong> instead of you having to implement them yourself.</p>
			<p>A positive side effect is the sponsorship becoming <strong class="bold">visible</strong> to the open source community. This is good marketing and gives your company credibility and can help you <strong class="bold">attract new talent</strong>.</p>
			<p>You can sponsor individual developers or organizations when they are part of the <em class="italic">GitHub Sponsors</em> program. You can also sponsor them on behalf of your organization. This sponsorship can be a one-time or monthly payment and is visible in your profile or the profile of your organization (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.1</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer090" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – Enabled organization profile in GitHub Sponsors</p>
			<p>GitHub Sponsors does not charge any fees for sponsorships from user accounts, so 100% of these sponsorships go to the sponsored developer or organization.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Sponsor tiers</h2>
			<p>Sponsors <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>can set up different tiers for sponsoring. This can be done for one-time sponsorships as well as for recurring monthly payments (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.2</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer091" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_05_002.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – Monthly or One-time tier options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – Monthly or One-time tier options</p>
			<p>The owner can set up to 10 tiers monthly and up to 10 tiers for one-time payments. This lets them link customized rewards <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>to the different tiers. For example, the rewards could be as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Visibility</strong>: Sponsors can be mentioned on the website or social media. There may also be badges (such as Silver, Gold, and Platinum Sponsors) that are used to distinguish different levels of sponsorship.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Access</strong>: Sponsors can get access to private repositories or early versions.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prioritization</strong>: Bugs or feature requests from sponsors can be prioritized.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Support</strong>: Some sponsors also offer support (to a certain degree) for the solution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at sponsorship goals next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Sponsorship goals</h2>
			<p>Sponsored accounts <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>can set a funding goal. The goal can be based on the number of sponsors or the sponsorship in dollars per month and is displayed on the sponsorship page (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.3</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer092" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_05_003.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – Python's sponsorship goal of getting $12,000 per month&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – Python's sponsorship goal of getting $12,000 per month</p>
			<p>Sponsorship goals can be linked to certain milestones. For example, the maintainer can set a certain amount when they quit their day job and start working full-time on the project. The org can also set the amount required to hire a new developer to help maintain the project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned about the <strong class="bold">history</strong>, <strong class="bold">values</strong>, and <strong class="bold">principles</strong> of <strong class="bold">free and open source software</strong> and the impact it can have on your software delivery performance. A good <strong class="bold">open source strategy</strong>, combined with a good <strong class="bold">insourcing strategy</strong> and the ability for your teams to sponsor and fund open source projects, can help you shorten your time to market significantly and have your engineers work on the features that matter for your company. Applying the principles to your company as <strong class="bold">inner source</strong> can help you build a collaborative culture and achieve better cross-team collaboration.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn about automation with GitHub Actions.</p>
