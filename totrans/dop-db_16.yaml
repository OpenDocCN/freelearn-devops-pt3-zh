- en: Relational databases have been the backbone of data storage for many years.
    Traditional relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle have been
    known for their reliability, robustness, and adherence to **Atomicity, Consistency,
    Isolation, Durability** (**ACID**) principles. However, in recent years, with
    the advent of big data and real-time processing needs, there have been growing
    demands for more scalability and versatility from these systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the foreseeable future, we anticipate advancements that will transform the
    relational database landscape. Firstly, enhanced scalability will become a standard
    feature, driven by the ever-increasing volumes of data generated daily. Techniques
    such as database sharding and the use of distributed database systems will become
    more common, enabling relational databases to handle larger datasets efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, improved support for unstructured data is anticipated. Traditional
    relational databases primarily cater to structured data. However, as the variety
    of data types and sources continues to expand, we expect advancements that will
    enable these databases to store and process unstructured data more effectively.
    This could involve integrating capabilities of NoSQL databases, leading to hybrid
    systems that offer the benefits of both structured and unstructured data handling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In-memory databases such as Redis and Memcached offer superior performance for
    data-intensive applications by storing data in memory rather than on disk. As
    RAM prices continue to decrease and the need for real-time processing grows, we
    can expect the adoption of in-memory databases to increase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Future advancements in this field are likely to involve increased durability
    and persistence. Traditionally, in-memory databases have been vulnerable to data
    loss in the event of a power failure or system crash. To mitigate this risk, we
    can expect advancements in technology that increase the durability of in-memory
    databases, possibly through improved data replication strategies or integration
    with persistent storage solutions.
