			<h1 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>An overview of Copado</h1>
			<p>Copado provides an end-to-end platform for<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> developing in <strong class="bold">Salesforce</strong> using <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> principles and practices. As a native<a id="_idIndexMarker550"/> app built on the Salesforce platform, Copado aims to address gaps in the core Salesforce product that inhibit effective <strong class="bold">continuous integration and delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>). This overview will detail Copado’s underlying data <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>model, key technical capabilities, and administration based on its publicly <span class="No-Break">available documentation.</span></p>
			<p>Copado allows teams to implement DevOps workflows entirely within Salesforce without the extensive use of external tools. It integrates version control, build automation, testing, and deployment while retaining native reporting and process visibility. The platform centers around a core abstraction layer that handles much of the complexity of tasks, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>branch <span class="No-Break">management, automatically.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/>Platform</h2>
			<p>Copado utilizes a <strong class="bold">user-story-centered data model</strong>, that is to say, a deployment model centered around user stories, to associate any <a id="_idIndexMarker553"/>requirements with specific metadata changes. The user <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/>story entity relates code to its business purpose and scopes for work for incremental delivery. Stories flow through predefined pipelines that span the lower development environments up through to production, as is the case with other configuration management databases. The following screenshot shows a <span class="No-Break">sample pipeline:</span></p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.1 – An example of a Copado pipeline</p>
			<p>The Copado platform layers abstraction on top of complex <strong class="bold">Git</strong> branching and merging operations through the use of a semantic conflict resolution engine. This prevents developers from needing to handle merge conflicts and Git commands manually. Instead, the platform handles branching in a declarative way by using the pipelines flowing from the lower to <span class="No-Break">higher environments.</span></p>
			<p>All user actions within Copado integrate with native Salesforce objects for centralized reporting and process monitoring. This retains auditability and visibility within the comfortable Salesforce interface that administrators already understand. No external dashboards or reports are needed to monitor the <span class="No-Break">DevOps processes.</span></p>
			<p>Copado’s capabilities cover the entire DevOps lifecycle, from the initial requirements through to <span class="No-Break">production </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker555"/></span><span class="No-Break">deployment:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Requirement management for <span class="No-Break">user stories</span></li>
				<li>Automated <span class="No-Break">version control</span></li>
				<li>Continuous integration, triggering <span class="No-Break">quality gates</span></li>
				<li>Co-ordinated promotion through <span class="No-Break">the environments</span></li>
				<li>Deployment <span class="No-Break">pipeline configuration</span></li>
				<li>Org syncing through <span class="No-Break">back promotion</span></li>
				<li>Built-in visibility <span class="No-Break">and reporting</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Together, these aim to provide a comprehensive system for development teams to implement agile, iterative DevOps patterns <span class="No-Break">within Salesforce.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"/>Version control</h2>
			<p>Copado integrates Git version control by automatically creating feature branches for each user story’s committed <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>metadata components. The exact branch structure mirrors the progression of user stories flowing between different Salesforce sandboxes and environments defined in <span class="No-Break">the pipelines.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows integration with <span class="No-Break">version control:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer044">
					<img alt="Figure 13.2 – Copado Git integration" src="image/B19436_13_02.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.2 – Copado Git integration</p>
			<p>Bi-directional deployment and the merging of branches keep all environments and sandboxes in sync as changes flow upstream and downstream through testing and production. No manual Git <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>operations are required on the part of the developers <span class="No-Break">or administrators.</span></p>
			<p>Copado’s conflict detection utilizes semantic analysis for metadata rather than just syntactic code reconciliation. This allows it to detect logical conflicts between components that may not be mergeable, such as conflicting field-level security rules. The platform alerts users to these conflicts early to avoid <span class="No-Break">deployment failures.</span></p>
			<p>An administrator can define an organization’s branching strategy and environment topology through the pipelines in Copado without needing to know Git internals. The complexity is hidden below the <span class="No-Break">abstraction layer.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>Build integration</h2>
			<p>Continuous integration is a key capability of <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>Copado. Upon each code check-in or commit action, the platform can automatically trigger configured tests, validations, and other quality gates. These may include Apex tests, linting, static analysis, or any other <span class="No-Break">custom steps.</span></p>
			<p>The output of tests and validations is recorded directly onto related user stories within Salesforce for traceability. Developers can see the results immediately without a separate CI server. You can retain compliance on code quality through <span class="No-Break">native reporting.</span></p>
			<p>Third-party tools, such as <strong class="bold">Jira</strong> and <strong class="bold">Azure DevOps</strong>, can integrate <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>with Copado’s CI pipeline via built-in webhooks<a id="_idIndexMarker560"/> or custom <strong class="bold">Apex</strong> adapters. Custom plugins allow admins to modify and customize Copado’s standard CI/CD process to insert custom quality gates. For instance, you could configure a webhook to call out to your preferred security scanning tool via its API just <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>before your code is deployed to your UAT or <span class="No-Break">production environments.</span></p>
			<p>Copado aims to promote shift-left testing and quality assurance by baking it into the commit process automatically. The mandatory gates keep all code checked in at a minimum quality bar through consistent, <span class="No-Break">automated enforcement.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>Deployment</h2>
			<p>Within deployment, Copado introduces<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> the concept of promotions for moving user stories between environments in the pipelines. Promotions pull metadata changes downstream using the pipelines defined through the declarative <span class="No-Break">Copado interface.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows a sample <span class="No-Break">user story:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer045">
					<img alt="Figure 13.3 – A sample Copado user story" src="image/B19436_13_03.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.3 – A sample Copado user story</p>
			<p>Permission schemes grant the approvals required for progression between pipeline stages. Mandatory manual approval gates can ensure that any changes are authorized. Copado’s selective rollback <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>capability can also redeploy previous metadata commitments (as needed) to rapidly <span class="No-Break">revert production.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">“Stages” are categorized as collections of environments fulfilling similar business roles, such as development, testing, production, etc. They provide release managers with the ability to organize their pipelines and environments<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> visually and systematically. Additionally, stages facilitate the configuration and execution of various functionalities when actions are carried out within them. For instance, in scenarios involving quality gate rules or automation rules or when using Copado’s <strong class="bold">Continuous Delivery</strong> and <strong class="bold">Deployment</strong> steps, one can choose particular stages at which to apply <span class="No-Break">these processes.</span></p>
			<p>Connection behaviors configure additional actions, such as automated email notifications, that execute on a per-stage basis in the pipelines. For example, you may want all production deployments to email a security auditor. Behaviors standardize <span class="No-Break">these processes.</span></p>
			<p>Promotions couple code <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>movement with approval and notification policies to avoid <em class="italic">shadow IT</em>, the performance of IT tasks by non-IT staff, and implement compliance. Rollback mitigates risk by allowing unsafe changes to be removed from the environment automatically if they are found to <span class="No-Break">cause issues.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>Environments</h2>
			<p>Copado keeps Salesforce sandboxes in<a id="_idIndexMarker566"/> strict transactional sync without repetitive and manual refresh operations. Refreshing between lower environments creates significant friction in <span class="No-Break">development workflows.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Back promotion</strong> is a process designed to transfer <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>user stories from higher to lower environments, serving three main purposes: it ensures synchronization across environments by maintaining consistent changes, facilitates the propagation of hotfixes from production to the lower environments, and helps reduce merge conflicts by recommending the back promotion of changes for <span class="No-Break">streamlined integration.</span></p>
			<p>Instead, back promotions (see callout) automatically merge upstream code changes into lower environments on demand. The platform continuously monitors the state of each organization for deployment readiness before executing <span class="No-Break">downstream distributions.</span></p>
			<p>Limited canary releases introduce a subset of new metadata to a sandbox before complete distribution for incremental rollout. This limits risk and allows testing smaller <span class="No-Break">change batches.</span></p>
			<p>Together, these capabilities allow developers to access the latest shared changes without refreshing, even as updates continually flow to production. It provides a tight inner <span class="No-Break">development loop.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>Change management</h2>
			<p>Change management, in this context, refers<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> to the ability to control any changes to user permissions and access; this poses challenges in Salesforce because permissions and access controls sit across interconnected <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>metadata entities such as profiles, permission sets, and field-level <span class="No-Break">security rules.</span></p>
			<p>Full profile deployment in Copado encapsulates all associated metadata to deploy profiles as a single atomic unit. This avoids permissions drifting out of sync as changes spread. Similarly, permission sets maintain consistent field-level access <span class="No-Break">between environments.</span></p>
			<p>The platform tracks all modifications, attributing them to specific developers, user stories, and commitments for complete auditability. You can produce detailed reports on modifications to sensitive configurations or attributes, such as the <span class="No-Break">record owner.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, change tracking preserves security compliance and configuration integrity as changes flow bi-directionally between lower and higher levels. Dependent metadata is deployed in a single package, avoiding the fragmentation that can come from <span class="No-Break">multiple deployments.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor293"/>Administration</h2>
			<p>A key goal of Copado is enabling implementation without extensive training or specialization. All configurations leverage <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>declarative, point-and-click customization similar to the core Salesforce interface. Users already familiar with Salesforce will find the <span class="No-Break">tool intuitive.</span></p>
			<p>Reporting integrates with Salesforce core objects, such as user stories and promotions, to generate process metrics and dashboards for visibility. Prebuilt templates ship out of <span class="No-Break">the box.</span></p>
			<p>Admins oversee access control, usage policies, and other platform governance by using the same tools as the core of Salesforce. Change sets can push policies between environments and profiles <span class="No-Break">control access.</span></p>
			<p>Ultimately, the declarative nature of Copado administration keeps the learning curve low. Organizations can iteratively refine roles and permissions as practices mature <span class="No-Break">without disruption.</span></p>
			<p>Copado provides an extensible platform for implementing the continuous deployment of Salesforce applications using practices such as immutable infrastructure and infrastructure as code. Its core value comes from the native integration and automated handling of deployment complexities inherent to the <span class="No-Break">Salesforce platform.</span></p>
			<p>Overall, Copado aims to eliminate many of the repetitive tasks and barriers to implementing modern DevOps<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> practices within Salesforce development. By providing version control, CI/CD, and environment management, it allows teams to scale agile and iterative development. The consolidation within Salesforce UIs <span class="No-Break">simplifies adoption.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor294"/>Robotic testing</h2>
			<p>Designed to dramatically reduce the time and effort required for developing and deploying test cases, <strong class="bold">Copado robotic testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRT</strong>) offers<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> detailed analyses of test cases, enhancing the effectiveness of testing processes. As a primarily cloud-based solution, it can be accessed via www.robotic.copado.com, and it also has the flexibility of being available as an on-premise service. To cater to a diverse user base, CRT offers a limited free version, which serves as an excellent resource for learning and understanding <span class="No-Break">the framework.</span></p>
			<p>One of the standout features of CRT is its versatility in writing test cases for a broad spectrum of applications. This<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> includes web-based applications, mobile applications, Salesforce Apps, ServiceNow apps, SAP systems, simple websites, and REST APIs. Its dual nature as a low-code and pro-code platform makes it particularly accessible; users without extensive knowledge of test scripting languages or frameworks can still develop test cases efficiently, thanks to its keyword-driven <span class="No-Break">development feature.</span></p>
			<p>CRT further streamlines the testing process with its capability to live test and video-stream test case executions. This feature significantly expedites the debugging process, allowing for real-time issue identification and resolution. Additionally, the framework provides the flexibility to schedule test case executions in alignment with <span class="No-Break">organizational policies.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, Copado robotic testing stands out as a comprehensive, flexible, and efficient test automation framework suitable for a wide range of applications and user expertise levels. Its combination of live testing capabilities, integration options, and a structured approach to testing infrastructure makes it a valuable tool in the landscape of software development and <span class="No-Break">quality assurance.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>Understanding the strengths of Copado</h1>
			<p>Founded in 2013, Copado has emerged as a leading end-to-end DevOps platform tailored for Salesforce development and release <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>management. With substantial growth capital from Salesforce Ventures and other investors, Copado offers a comprehensive suite of capabilities to support and accelerate <span class="No-Break">Salesforce deployments.</span></p>
			<p>A key strength of Copado is its deep native integration with the Salesforce platform. Copado was originally constructed to solve a big need in the market right now: to help underpin the Salesforce <span class="No-Break">DevOps lifecycle.</span></p>
			<p>By building natively on Salesforce, Copado inherits the security, authentication, and other advantages of the platform while maintaining tight integration between development and operations. This contrasts with other tools that operate outside of Salesforce, leading to potential <span class="No-Break">integration challenges.</span></p>
			<p>Relatedly, Copado’s metadata intelligence gives it an edge in understanding dependencies, detecting conflicts, and merging changes within Salesforce environments. Copado’s secret sauce is its ability to build (on your behalf) a feature-specific branch by converting the one-to-one relationship between your user story in that <span class="No-Break">feature-specific branch.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">A merge conflict happens when two changes <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>are made in separate environments to the same metadata components in a way that can’t be <span class="No-Break">reconciled automatically.</span></p>
			<p>Rather than operating on files, Copado works at the metadata API layer, giving it an advantage in merging and deploying changes. This helps address the merge conflicts that users commonly encounter with <span class="No-Break">Salesforce metadata.</span></p>
			<p>Copado also shines in providing end-to-end application lifecycle management, not just deployment. Its issue tracking, user stories, pipelines, and workflows support development teams in planning, co-ordinating, and tracking work from idea through to release. Jira tickets, for instance, become Copado user stories, connecting development work to downstream release processes. This can accelerate development by linking business requirements to <span class="No-Break">developer efforts.</span></p>
			<p>For larger development teams, Copado is difficult to match in terms of functionality and integration. It combines the advantages of Salesforce’s platform with Heroku’s scalable infrastructure for computationally<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> intensive tasks, such as metadata processing. The Heroku architecture eases security audits while providing necessary performance. This allows Copado to<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> offer <strong class="bold">application lifecycle management</strong> (<strong class="bold">ALM</strong>), testing, compliance, and other tools not found in most <span class="No-Break">deployment-focused solutions.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor296"/>Exploring the weaknesses of Copado</h1>
			<p>Copado has emerged as a robust solution, offering a comprehensive suite of features that support all aspects of the Salesforce <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>development lifecycle. However, as with any tool, it has its limitations and challenges. This section explores these potential weaknesses, providing a balanced view of the platform’s capabilities <span class="No-Break">and limitations.</span></p>
			<p>One of the key challenges often mentioned in relation to Copado is its complexity. The tool offers a wide range of features and capabilities, which can be overwhelming for new users. The learning curve associated with effectively leveraging all of the tool’s features can be steep, potentially slowing down implementation <span class="No-Break">and adoption.</span></p>
			<p>A related issue is the potential difficulty of integrating Copado into existing Salesforce and CI/CD ecosystems, particularly those with complex tech stacks. Compatibility and seamless integration with various tools may require additional configuration and effort, which can be a challenge for teams with <span class="No-Break">limited resources.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, Copado requires ongoing maintenance to keep it aligned with changes in Salesforce, your CI/CD pipeline, and your organization’s evolving needs. Managing these continuous changes can be time-consuming and may strain resources, especially for <span class="No-Break">smaller teams.</span></p>
			<p>Another potential weakness of Copado is the way it handles backend processing. Although the use of Heroku for backend processing allows Copado to leverage Heroku’s power and speed for metadata retrieval, processing, and deployments, it also has a startup cost. If Heroku is being used to deploy metadata from a code repository, it has to clone that metadata first, leading to some performance cost for <span class="No-Break">each job.</span></p>
			<p>However, it is worth noting that Copado claims to have optimized this process, fetching only the minimal amount of history to enable the merge. But even with this optimization, the startup cost can still be a potential bottleneck, especially for <span class="No-Break">larger deployments.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, while Copado’s use of Salesforce as its user interface and for data storage offers some benefits, it also presents some challenges. For instance, all logs and other files are stored as attachments in the Salesforce package, which can make them difficult to read. Moreover, the UI, being built on Salesforce, can look slightly awkward to some users and may not always provide<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> the most intuitive <span class="No-Break">user experience.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, Copado’s notifications about job results are not always obvious, which can lead to confusion or missed notifications. This can be particularly problematic in a DevOps environment, where timely notifications about deployments, tests, and other processes are crucial. See, for instance, the following screenshot of a notification that hasn’t been updated properly and, therefore, is marked as done but is neither finished  <span class="No-Break">nor successful:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer046">

			<p>Ultimately, while Copado is undoubtedly a powerful and comprehensive DevOps tool for Salesforce, it is not without its challenges. Understanding these potential weaknesses is crucial for organizations considering Copado implementation, as it allows them to plan for these challenges and ensure <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>they have the necessary resources and strategies in place to <span class="No-Break">overcome them.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, Copado offers a robust and comprehensive suite of DevOps tools specifically designed for Salesforce. By offering deep, native integration with Salesforce, it effectively addresses gaps in the platform, automating complex tasks such as version control, CI/CD, and <span class="No-Break">environment management.</span></p>
