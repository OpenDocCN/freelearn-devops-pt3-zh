<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">The world of technology has various terms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">At times, such terms can be abstract, and people tend to apply various interpretations to a specific framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">DevOps is no exception. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.4">Additionally, when referring to DevOps, considering perspectives from an individual, team, and the entire organization can sometimes make it unclear how various components interact with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">each other.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">We will review the basics of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1"> DevOps, clear up misconceptions, and touch on some of its typical practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Now, before we dive into what DevOps is, let’s talk about how things used to be in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">the past.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Background on DevOps</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Back in the day, software </span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">was essentially something you installed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">So, for a product development team, all you needed were engineers who could develop and test it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">Speaking of testing, it was all about squashing bugs before the release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.4">Just imagine it for a moment; it was</span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1"> similar to the release of early video games, much like the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Nintendo Entertainment System</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">NES</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">) era. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Once a game was shipped on a cartridge, there was no opportunity for updates or adding new features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">Bugs that shipped with the game remained with the consumer forever. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.4">However, with the emergence of the Apache HTTP Server and the shift toward network communication, the need arose for IT Operations to manage this </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">new paradigm.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">In many cases, the IT Operations team specialized in IT operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Their tools, culture, and even their objectives were different from those of the development team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">The development team wanted to add features, while the IT team considered system stability their top priority. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">This was </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">a contradiction.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Moreover, in the divided world of these two teams, when it came to deployment, it felt like tossing code over the wall. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">Developers would toss a perfectly deployable artifact to the IT Operations team on the other side of the wall. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">However, for some reason, the IT Operations team would receive something incomplete and non-functional for the production environment, leading to exhaustion as they struggled to deploy and maintain </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">it somehow:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">In recent years, there has been remarkable technological advancement, and its influence has permeated well beyond the realm of software, touching virtually every industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Why is this the case? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">This is because software development plays a pivotal role in the strategies of organizations, regardless of their size, in modern business management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">Companies affected by this technological wave find themselves in a competitive landscape where the focus is on delivering swift, cutting-edge, and reliable products to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">their customers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Despite the possibility of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">significant changes in market conditions and customer needs in less than a year, releasing software only a few times annually is not sufficient. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">We cannot afford delays in software releases due to friction between internal silos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">A </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">silo</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> denotes</span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1"> an isolated system, process, or department that lacks integration or communication with other parts, potentially causing inefficiencies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">We must find a way to streamline the process from product development to operation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">This is where a completely new development methodology, organizational structure, and culture come </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">into play.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">DevOps emerges as a methodology born from this very scenario. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">It represents a fusion of development and operations, where development and operations teams collaborate as a unified entity to instill a shared culture, refine processes, and deploy tools, all in the pursuit of expediting releases, enhancing overall product quality, gathering customer feedback, and ultimately providing better and faster service to customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">This, in turn, leads to more effective </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">market performance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">What </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">is DevOps?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">The term </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">DevOps</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1"> is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">a blend of the words </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Development</span></strong> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">and </span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Operations</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">So, is DevOps simply about fostering collaboration between the development and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">operations teams?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">While that’s part of the story, the reality is often more complex. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">There’s usually a disconnect between these two teams, each having their unique priorities and objectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">Merely bringing them together may enhance their relationship and mutual understanding to a degree, but that’s often insufficient for effective collaboration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.4">In essence, DevOps transcends just integrating roles or teams; it represents a broader cultural shift within the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.5">It is about aligning priorities, streamlining workflows, and, ultimately, breaking down silos that hinder effective communication </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">and progress.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">In brief, DevOps is the union of people, process, and tools to continually provide value to end users and is fundamentally a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">cultural shift:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Many people think they understand it here and move on to implementing an automation pipeline for DevOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">But wait. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">Simply replacing these elements alone will not ensure the success of a DevOps initiative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">For DevOps to be successful, you need to know more about what it is, what it is not, and why </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">it is.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">In reality, the definition of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">DevOps is quite broad. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Consequently, the concept of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Dev*Ops</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">, an extended form of DevOps, has been rapidly expanding recently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Various derivative approaches such as DevSecOps and BizDevOps have been proposed, leading to a multitude of perspectives on what </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">DevOps encompasses.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted, precise definition of DevOps, and how to do something called DevOps is answered differently by different people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">Consequently, misconceptions and inaccurate interpretations about DevOps are common, often leading to disputes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">And sometimes, people do not want to talk about it when it comes time to talk about doing DevOps, even though it is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">so important!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Often, when defining what DevOps is, it might be easier to indicate what is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">NOT</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1"> DevOps rather than trying to specify what DevOps truly is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Let’s clear up a typical </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">misunderstanding</span></span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1"> here.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">DevOps is NOT just about a tool, technology, or product</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">There are numerous tools available in the market that can be applied to DevOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">Many cloud and tool vendors promote them by saying, “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">With this tool, you can build a DevOps workflow</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">,” or “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">This tool is essential for a </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">DevOps team.</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">When</span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1"> many people hear the term </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">DevOps</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">, some of them think of cloud technologies such as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">Amazon Web Services</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">AWS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">), Azure, and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">Google Cloud Platform</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">GCP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">), or </span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">Furthermore, Kubernetes’ ecosystem also includes many components such as Istio, Flux, Helm, Envoy, and Prometheus. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">There are several platforms, including GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Jenkins, that facilitate continuous, fast, and frequent releases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.4">The world of monitoring tools is equally diverse. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.5">If you are not yet acquainted with these names, it might take some time to understand their nuances </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">and benefits.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">However, even if you master these tools and follow well-known architectures or success stories, that does not mean you have achieved DevOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Because people and process always exist behind the tool, and just changing tools will not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">change them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">In reality, it is not uncommon to see waterfall-style development even while using tools branded with the name </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">DevOps</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Respecting existing complex company rules by inserting multi-step approval processes into automated workflows, restricting customer releases to once every 3 months to avoid changing accounting or security checks, or having the infrastructure team manage containers created by the app team using a platform built with the modern orchestration system, Kubernetes—doing all these things will only increase the operational burden and confusion rather than creating </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">business value.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Ultimately, achieving significant business goals and transformations requires changes in people, organizations, and processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">Then, is DevOps about transforming individuals </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">and organizations?</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">DevOps is NOT just specific individuals, teams, or roles</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">DevOps is a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">reality, but the term itself is somewhat of a buzzword. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">Companies hire engineers for these new activities with titles such as DevOps Engineer or DevOps Architect, and they even refer to their teams as DevOps teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">People who think they cannot do DevOps themselves may even make the mistake of trying to outsource DevOps to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">DevOps partners.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">When you look at this situation, it might seem like DevOps refers to specific individuals, teams, or roles, but that’s not the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">In many instances, these terms simply refer to roles such as super infrastructure engineers, super developers, or just </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">cloud engineers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">Companies do this because, in order to respond quickly to evolving business needs and achieve rapid releases, they require new technologies and automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">Moreover, they often have to manage complex platforms that include both existing and new components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.3">This includes making the most use of GitHub Actions, which is covered in this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.4">Areas that used to involve manual installation in the infrastructure domain, configuration through screens, or CLI operations now require to be under version control with Git and the configuration and management of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">automated workflows.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">However, in practice, DevOps deals with even more complex matters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">It is not just about mastering these tools and technologies or configuring roles for them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.3">In reality, it requires strong leaders who can lead transformation within existing systems and organizations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.4">Often, they engage in actions that go beyond the broad framework of DevOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.5">Many of the individuals I have seen who have truly achieved DevOps are pursuing larger goals rather than just the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">implementation </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">of DevOps</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">DevOps is essentially a journey to transform organizations that deal with a variety of complex technologies and products, and it is not about simply adding people with new skills to existing teams or changing team or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">job definitions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">So, if DevOps is not merely a tool nor solely about people and organization, does a process specifically termed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">DevOps exist?</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">DevOps is NOT just a process</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">DevOps teams often engage in iterative development over short cycles of 2-3 weeks, commonly</span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1"> called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">sprints</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">, and hold stand-up meetings every morning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">This is true, and by adopting DevOps, you may incorporate processes that adhere to Agile process and Scrum best practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">These are methodologies in software development that divide each functionality into smaller parts and drive development through numerous </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">short cycles.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">So, is DevOps</span><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1"> an evolved concept of Agile or Scrum, or does it encompass them? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">The answer to this question is both </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">yes</span></em> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">and </span></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">no</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">DevOps broadens the scope to not just focus on software development like Agile, but also extends to the release of software, gathering feedback, and improvements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">These principles and philosophies apply throughout</span><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1"> the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">Software Development Life Cycle</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">SDLC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">Teams focus on the entire life cycle of the product, not just on developing new features or designing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">web components:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">However, the ultimate goal of DevOps is not to introduce a new </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">process itself.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">DevOps has a wide range of practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">Specific practices will be elaborated on from </span><a href="B21203_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">Chapter 5</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1"> onward, but not all these practices can be equally applied to every team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">For example, an environment that needs to deploy applications to numerous servers such as Microsoft is different from a situation where a small application is deployed to an EC2 instance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">The practices to be applied also differ between a service with a user base of 1 million and a service with a user base </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">of 1,000.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">Let’s consider Agile, quoting from Andy </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">Hunt’s blog:</span></span></p>
<p class="author-quote"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">Agile methods ask practitioners to think, and frankly, that’s a hard sell. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">It is far more comfortable to simply follow what rules are given and claim you are “doing it by the book.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">It is easy, it is safe from ridicule or recrimination; you will not get fired for it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.4">While we might publicly decry the narrow confines of a set of rules, there is safety and comfort there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.5">But of course, to be agile or effective is not about comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">This idea applies to DevOps as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">In order to frequently and swiftly release customer-centric developments, offer a reliable service, and ultimately make a significant impact on the business, you need to tackle problems from a broader perspective than just tools, people, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">and process.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">DevOps is culture</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">So, DevOps is more than </span><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">just a fusion of development and operations, specific roles, processes, tools, technology, or products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">But, people often simplify it as people, process, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">and tools.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">So, what is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">DevOps, really?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">Let’s turn to the words of Patrick Debois, a prominent figure in the DevOps community, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">for clarity:</span></span></p>
<p class="author-quote"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">My current definition of Dev*Ops: everything you do to overcome the friction created by silos ... </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">All the rest is plain engineering.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">In today’s era of cloud technology, both cutting-edge companies and traditional enterprises, along with start-ups, can readily access the same environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">Even AI-powered tools are available at an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">affordable cost.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">Ultimately, what hinders your team and business progress is friction, and this friction often arises within silos that encompass people, process, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">and tools.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">DevOps, at its core, represents a cultural shift and an approach designed to eliminate friction among the silos within an organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">It entails a shift in mindset, habits, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">and culture.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">So, what exactly constitutes a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">DevOps culture? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">Let’s delve into the core principles of DevOps to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what this culture </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">truly entails.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">Customer-centric</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">Every action in every process should aim to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">provide value to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">the customer.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">Focusing on the customer while building and maintaining software enables quicker and more relevant feature delivery. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">Short feedback loops contribute to fine-tuning the product in alignment with user needs, reducing risks, and maximizing value at the lowest possible cost. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.3">By focusing on the customer’s needs, the ultimate goal becomes efficiently solving real-world problems, making it easier to prioritize tasks, manage backlogs, and streamline resource allocation, making operations efficient and cost-effective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.4">Ultimately, this sets the stage for long-term business success by better meeting market demands</span><a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1"> and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">user expectations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">In DevOps, being customer-centric is not just a catchphrase; it is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">a necessity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">Creating with the end </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">in mind</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">Understanding</span><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1"> customer needs and addressing real-world problems should take precedence over operating on mere assumptions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">This advocates for a holistic strategy where teams synchronize both developmental and operational tasks to satisfy customer requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.3">This includes a grasp of the product’s entire life cycle, from its inception and development through to its deployment and ongoing support, making certain that the final deliverable genuinely benefits the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">end users.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">Neglecting customer needs from the beginning can result in a technically impeccable product that, nonetheless, misses the mark in terms of user satisfaction and problem-solving capability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">This principle acts as a constant cue to align all technological endeavors with business goals and user expectations, ensuring that the final product is not only functional but also valuable and relevant to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">the audience.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">Cross-functional autonomous teams</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">At the core of successful DevOps</span><a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1"> implementation is the indispensable strategy of forming autonomous, cross-functional teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">Unlike traditional engineering setups, where developers, operations, and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">Quality Assurance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">QA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">) specialists</span><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1"> operate in distinct compartments, DevOps champions the dissolution of these barriers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">The key takeaway here is not just the formation of diverse teams but making these teams autonomous—capable of overseeing a product or feature from inception </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">to delivery.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">Why is this essential? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">answer lies in agility and efficiency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">When a team possesses a range of skills, from coding and testing to deployment and design—and even a nuanced understanding of the business—the speed of decision-making accelerates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.3">This replaces the sluggish and cumbersome chain of command inherent in hierarchical systems with a culture of prompt, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">accountable action.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">The elimination of these organizational bottlenecks not only speeds up the workflow but also cultivates a culture of ownership and accountability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">The team does not have to wait for external departments or higher-ups to make decisions; they have the collective skill set and the empowerment to address </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">challenges head-on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">By dissolving silos that often cause friction within organizations, autonomous, cross-functional teams serve as the linchpin for smooth DevOps operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.2">The result is a streamlined process that facilitates quick responses to changes and fosters a culture of collaboration and responsibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.3">This is not just a nice-to-have feature of modern engineering; it is a foundational strategy for any enterprise aiming to successfully </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">implement DevOps.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">Continuous improvement</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">Continuous improvement</span><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1"> serves as the bedrock of DevOps, offering both technical and cultural advantages that are indispensable for modern software development and operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">On the technical side, it enables qualities such as reliability, adaptability, and efficiency of software delivery processes through ongoing analysis of performance metrics and utilization of automated workflows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.3">These features not only make the end product robust but also contribute to resource optimization and quicker feature delivery. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.4">Culturally, continuous improvement fosters a collaborative environment, ensuring accountability, encouraging a learning culture, and ultimately aiding in the breakdown of organizational silos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.5">It also aligns strategically with improved </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">developer experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">The importance of continuous improvement becomes even clearer when viewed through the lens of feedback loops, which act as the nervous system of the DevOps life cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">These loops enable real-time monitoring and provide actionable metrics that feed directly into continuous improvement initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.3">By regularly assessing system performance, user engagement, and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1"> other </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">Key Performance Indicators</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">KPIs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">), organizations can quickly adjust their strategies and ensure long-term success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">This dynamic, data-driven approach is essential in today’s fast-paced technology landscape, making continuous improvement not just a best practice but a fundamental requirement for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">competitive survival.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">Automation</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">In </span><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">traditional development models, development and operations have often been two separate silos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">The developers focused on writing code and building applications, while operations focused on deployment and maintenance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.3">This disjointed approach often led to delays, inefficiencies, and friction between the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">two teams.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">CI/CD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">) emerged </span><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">as the crucial bridge to connect these two worlds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.2">With CI, code changes from multiple contributors are frequently merged into a shared repository, where automated tests are run to detect errors and inconsistencies as swiftly as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.3">This encourages a more collaborative environment by making it easier to identify issues early in the development cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.4">CD ensures the code is always ready for deployment, eliminating lengthy </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">freeze periods</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1"> where no new features could be added because a release </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">was pending.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">Manual processes are not only prone to errors but also act as a significant drag on speed and efficiency, the very issues DevOps aims to resolve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">Before automation was broadly adopted, system admins would manually configure servers, a cumbersome and error-prone process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.3">Also, developers would often find it challenging to replicate the ops environment for testing, leading to the notorious “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">It works on my </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">machine</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">” syndrome.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">Automation, in this context, is not a luxury but a necessity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.2">Automated scripts handle tasks from code testing to deployment, ensuring that the process is as standardized as possible, thereby eliminating many of the errors and delays associated with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">manual intervention.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">DevSecOps</span><a id="_idIndexMarker027"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1"> is an approach that integrates security elements into the DevOps framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">In this methodology, security is considered a crucial aspect from the initial stages of development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.3">The aim is to deliver software that is both efficient and secure in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">timely manner.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">Traditionally, security was often handled by separate specialized teams and was generally addressed in the final stages of the development cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">Many instances occurred where vulnerabilities were identified post-development, causing delays in software releases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.3">By adopting a shift-left approach to security, it is possible to significantly reduce the cost of corrections. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.4">In the DevSecOps </span><a id="_idIndexMarker028"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">context, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">shift-left</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1"> refers to the practice of integrating security measures earlier in the SDLC, ideally during the design and development phases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.2">By addressing security concerns from the outset, teams aim to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities more efficiently, reducing the costs and risks associated with late-stage fixes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.3">The shift-left approach emphasizes proactive security rather than reactive, ensuring that applications are secure by design. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.4">The remediation costs for security issues that emerge during the operational phase can be prohibitively high. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.5">Moreover, this late-stage focus puts customer data at risk and can harm a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">company’s reputation.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">The adoption of IaC alleviates these challenges significantly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.2">In an IaC environment, the state of the infrastructure is defined in code, which is then automatically applied by configuration management tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.3">This eliminates the need for tedious manual work and ensures high levels of reproducibility and consistency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.4">Furthermore, since these tools handle the automated building and operation of the infrastructure, the processes become far more efficient and can be automated, allowing for more reliable and scalable </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">system management.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">Observability</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">Observability serves as a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker034"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">crucial component in managing modern software systems, especially within a DevOps framework that seeks to eliminate friction and enhance communication across organizational silos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.2">Observability is often perceived as an evolved form of monitoring, but each serves its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">unique purpose.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">In traditional monitoring, the focal point is to observe predefined elements of a system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.2">Essentially, monitoring is rule-based. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.3">It involves setting predetermined metrics and benchmarks that, when breached, generate alerts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.4">Monitoring is about keeping an eye on known issues—it is an approach that asks, “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">Is my system working as expected?</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">” However, the scope of monitoring is typically limited to spotting where the problem has arisen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.2">Not why it happened. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.3">This may only show the tip of the iceberg. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.4">It is going to take a long time to get the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">whole overview:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">Now, these are just examples, but to keep DevOps at its best and to grow it further, an organization needs to think about its developers over the long term. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.2">No matter if you are an individual contributor or a manager, you are also responsible for making sure that your team members feel good about their work so that you can have the best team possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.3">If you embody a good development experience, your team members will give you a good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">experience too.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">Today’s developers juggle a plethora of responsibilities: coding, code reviews, architectural planning, and, occasionally, infrastructure deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.2">Some of these tasks occur at an organizational or team level, while others are individual endeavors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.3">DevOps clearly emphasizes collaborative efforts, but it is crucial to also focus on amplifying individual performance—a dynamic that needs careful monitoring. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.4">The developer experience also covers </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">this part.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">Numerous businesses are currently struggling due to a lack of skilled engineers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.2">However, consider this: in a 100-developer organization, if every developer could conserve 10 minutes each day, that would amount to nearly 17 extra hours. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.3">It is almost like adding two </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">additional members.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">However, measuring an individual engineer’s productivity poses a challenging endeavor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.2">Although quantifiable metrics such as the number of lines of code written or commits made may seem like reliable indicators, they often fail to provide a comprehensive view. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.3">Sometimes, a single well-thought-out line of code can be more valuable than 10 hastily composed ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.4">Tasks such as research and architectural design typically go unmeasured, further complicating the assessment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.5">Relying exclusively on these narrow metrics could unintentionally cultivate a culture of micromanagement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.6">When these metrics become evaluative benchmarks, there is a risk of promoting behaviors that emphasize noise over actual value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.7">These metrics are covered in </span><a href="B21203_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor125"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">Chapter 6</span></em></span></a><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">Now, what is the difference between developer productivity and developer impact? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.2">For productivity, the measure of success would be to do more work in less time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.3">On the other hand, it is very difficult to understand how to measure impact and what should be measured. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.4">Also, different teams have different definitions </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">of impact.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">The easiest thing to identify is something that can be quantified as a contribution to the eventual value of the product. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.2">For example, if a team is developing a new feature, the impact would be the number of users onboarded and the revenue generated from the new feature. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.3">Other examples can include</span><a id="_idIndexMarker045"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1"> downloads, requests, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">Service-Level Agreements</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">SLAs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">), and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">so on.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">While at the broader organizational level, in the context of overall optimization, it is necessary to ensure that the environment is broadly prepared to increase the productivity of all developers, at the narrower organizational level, it is necessary to develop strategies to increase developer productivity according to team, role, and experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.2">This includes minimizing lead times through DevOps practices that alleviate team bottlenecks while</span><a id="_idIndexMarker048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1"> providing individual developers with the tools they need to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">perform optimally.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">Collaboration</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">When it comes to fortifying developer experience for DevOps success, collaboration is the linchpin. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.2">It is not just about integrating the development team and infrastructure team and sharing some responsibility; it is about creating an environment where developers can thrive, contribute, and feel a sense of ownership and engagement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.3">The ideal is a state of transparent collaboration</span><a id="_idIndexMarker049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1"> where organizational silos are not just reduced but entirely eliminated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.2">This free flow of ideas, best practices, and constructive criticism leads to a work environment that fuels </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">developer experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">For example, it is said that DevOps is not just about tools and practices; it is a culture, a philosophy, and a concept aimed at business and organizational success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.2">In this context, Git and GitHub are often marginalized as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">just tools</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1"> or </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">means of communication</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.2">Such a viewpoint is sometimes true but often short-sighted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.3">Adopting this perspective may limit your understanding to only individual aspects such as how to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD or how to use Git and Git branching strategies when you intend to learn Git and GitHub </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">for DevOps.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">When working in an organization or as a team, the team consists of individual contributors such as developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.2">Especially when developers work in a team or an organization, communication becomes extremely complex. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.3">The success of this dialogue is ultimately the key to enhancing the productivity of the team or individual. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.4">Git and GitHub are not just tools but platforms to share code, get feedback, integrate, and grow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.5">The ability to communicate well in such environments is crucial to the success </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">of DevOps.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">One of the most powerful paradigms to facilitate this kind of collaboration is InnerSource. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.2">Borrowing from the open source collaboration model, InnerSource empowers developers within an organization to contribute to other teams’ projects that they are not formally a part of. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.3">Just like in open source development, InnerSource encourages open communication, code sharing, and collective problem-solving, effectively reducing silos that often </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">plague organizations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">The open source </span><a id="_idIndexMarker050"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">collaboration model itself serves as a testament to what can be achieved when barriers are broken down. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.2">By opening up a code base to the public, open source projects tap into a global community of developers, each bringing their unique perspective and expertise to the table. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.3">There’s a mutualistic relationship between individual growth and collective progress, a symbiosis that DevOps teams should strive for internally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.4">This open model brings with it the core tenets of transparent documentation, peer reviews, and a democratic approach to problem-solving, enriching the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">developer experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">Transparency is key to this collaboration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.2">When everyone from junior developers to team leads can access discussions, view code bases, and partake in decision-making, the walls between roles and departments start to crumble. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.3">This absence of silos naturally leads to quicker identification of issues, more efficient problem-solving, and a more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">unified vision.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.727.1">Security</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.1">GitHub is widely </span><a id="_idIndexMarker088"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.1">used as a platform for software development, but it also offers advanced experience in the realm of security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.2">With the increasing importance of maintaining high-level security for applications, GitHub features become even </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.730.1">more crucial.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.731.1">For instance, the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.1">Advanced Security</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.733.1"> feature automatically detects vulnerabilities in the code, making it easier for companies and developers to reduce risks by addressing these </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.1">issues promptly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.735.1">The platform also provides seamless management of security issues related to a project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.735.2">Specifically, the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.1">Security Overview</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.737.1"> dashboard allows you to easily review all security warnings and settings, centralizing the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.738.1">management process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.739.1">In addition, GitHub’s </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.740.1">secret scanning</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.1"> feature </span><a id="_idIndexMarker089"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.742.1">automatically scans for any secrets or API keys mistakenly</span><a id="_idIndexMarker090"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.1"> uploaded to GitHub, issuing warnings for them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.2">For supported platforms, GitHub goes a step further by automatically revoking keys that are mistakenly uploaded to public repositories, and it can validate the activity status of a key. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.3">Simply detecting secrets often falls short of comprehensive DevSecOps requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.4">This proactive approach not only identifies potential issues early but also significantly mitigates risks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.5">Additionally, the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.744.1">push protection</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.1"> feature</span><a id="_idIndexMarker091"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.1"> acts as a safeguard, preventing the accidental upload of sensitive information </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.1">to GitHub.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.748.1">The process of security policy creation and enforcement is also straightforward on GitHub. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.748.2">By setting up security policies and enforcing GitHub </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.749.1">Advanced Security</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.750.1"> across repositories, it becomes easier for developers to maintain a secure coding environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.750.2">This leads to a more consistent set of security measures being applied throughout the organization </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.751.1">or enterprise.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.1">Lastly, let’s talk about the supply chain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.2">Nowadays, virtually every company is utilizing open source technology in some form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.3">Many projects have hundreds of open source dependencies, which can potentially introduce security risks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.4">What happens if a vulnerability is discovered in one of these dependencies? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.5">This is where Dependabot comes into play. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.6">It automatically identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies and proposes updates, helping to reduce security risks in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.753.1">supply chain.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.754.1">Overall, GitHub covers </span><a id="_idIndexMarker092"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.755.1">multiple aspects of security, offering developers and companies useful tools for creating and managing safer code in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.756.1">shorter timeframe.</span></span></p>
