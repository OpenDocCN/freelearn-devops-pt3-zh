- en: In the last two chapters, you’ll learn all about monitoring, observability,
    and security. You’ll dive into the theory behind monitoring and observability,
    along with the hands-on portions of each so you can get a true understanding of
    how to implement different tools. Next, you’ll dive into security, which is typically
    overlooked in general but especially overlooked in Kubernetes.
