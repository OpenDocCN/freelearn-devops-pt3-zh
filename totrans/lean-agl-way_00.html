			<p>“<em class="italic">The Lean-Agile Way: Unleashing Enterprise Potential with Value Stream Management</em>” emerged from the collaborative efforts of lead author Cecil ‘Gary’ Rupp and esteemed colleagues Richard Knaster, Steve Pereira, and Al Shalloway. Together, they aimed to provide a comprehensive guide on modern Lean-Agile and value stream management practices tailored for IT specialists, business professionals, and domain experts across diverse industries <span class="No-Break">and organizations.</span></p>
			<p>Their journey began when Packt Publishing approached Gary to write a new book on modern Lean-Agile practices. Gary was drawn to this topic because of his long-term interest in it, which was fueled by his past practitioner and consulting experiences. Additionally, recent training engagements, including the delivery of an extensive online course to 600 IT specialists for a multinational client, reinforced his enthusiasm for exploring this area. Gary then approached his three colleagues to <span class="No-Break">join him.</span></p>
			<p>The collaborative effort of the authoring team ensures a rich and diverse perspective throughout this book, enriching the discourse and broadening its scope and relevance. It’s worth noting that the authors are not academics in the formal sense; rather, they are professionals who work closely with their clients in real-world scenarios, tackling challenges head-on to facilitate effective <span class="No-Break">work processes.</span></p>
			<p>The primary objective of this book is to introduce the integration of Lean and Agile principles and practices, recognizing the evolution of Lean from manufacturing industries and Agile from the software industry. Lean principles focus on eliminating waste and streamlining processes to deliver value more efficiently with higher quality. At the same time, Agile methodologies prioritize iterative development and constant feedback to enhance responsiveness to <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<p>The integration of Lean and Agile concepts, often referred to as ‘<em class="italic">Lean-Agile</em>,’ leverages the strengths of both approaches. It ensures high-quality, efficient deliveries and the ability to adapt to evolving market dynamics, thereby driving sustained <span class="No-Break">competitive advantage.</span></p>
			<p>At its core lies the fundamental premise that organizations must embrace Lean-Agile principles and practices holistically across the enterprise. This involves optimizing productivity, throughput, and efficiency while remaining sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing business requirements, market dynamics, and <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<p>Central to this approach is the concept of value stream management (VSM), advocated by the authors for driving continuous improvements across organizational value streams. Value streams organize the end-to-end business processes within organizations, serving as a more effective framework for delivering value to customers. The VSM concept helps organizations break down the cross-functional and departmental barriers that often impede efficient deliveries. By focusing on product-oriented activities and processes, value streams emphasize the importance of delivering value through the development and delivery of customer-centric products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<p>Aligned with their belief that methods must precede tools, the authors present a nine-step VSM methodology designed to assist organizations in identifying and prioritizing value stream improvements efficiently. At the core of this methodology lies value stream mapping, a critical technique for visualizing and analyzing business processes to pinpoint opportunities for enhancing efficiency and <span class="No-Break">reducing waste.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, the authors introduce advanced concepts focused on evaluating value stream improvements across a spectrum, ranging from early-stage development to maturity, characterized by standardized activities, high throughput, quality, and efficient flows. Additionally, they present the Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams (BLAST) framework, designed to integrate the work of multiple teams collaboratively using both Lean flow and Agile iterative and incremental development practices. This book also introduces the Business Agility System for the Enterprise (BASE) concepts, which integrates work across an enterprise to produce customer-centric increments of new product-oriented value continuously and <span class="No-Break">on cadence.</span></p>
			<p>In an era dominated by digital technologies, effective information use has revolutionized organizational competitiveness. The authors introduce the Business-Role-Information-Action (BRIA) process as a means to find the information needed to make informed and timely decisions. Beyond theory, BRIA offers practical strategies for harnessing digital advancements to improve business processes, systems, products, <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<p>This book is structured into four parts, progressing systematically from foundational concepts to advanced strategies for organizational transformation. Each section offers actionable insights and guidance to facilitate seamless adoption and sustained practice. However, those who are time-limited and need to cut to the chase should read <em class="italic">Part 4</em> (<em class="italic">Chapters 10, 11, and 12</em>) first, as these summary-level chapters discuss data and information management, Lean-Agile and VSM implementation, and <span class="No-Break">cross-cutting themes.</span></p>
			<p>As you embark on this learning journey, bear in mind the significance of collaboration and collective wisdom in driving meaningful change. The authors’ goal is not only to disseminate information but also to empower individuals and organizations to embrace Lean-Agile principles with confidence <span class="No-Break">and competence.</span></p>
			<p>While intentionally remaining neutral among the plethora of methodologies and frameworks promoting Lean-Agile and Value Stream Management concepts, the authors focus on advocating foundational principles and practices essential for driving enterprise change toward continuous, customer-centric, and <span class="No-Break">value-based improvements.</span></p>
			<p>Most importantly, the methods, tools,  and frameworks presented in this book are designed to simplify and sustain Lean-Agile adoptions, even within organizations already invested in other Lean-Agile frameworks. The authors cut through the clutter, distilling concepts for practical implementation and <span class="No-Break">enduring success.</span></p>
			<p>You are invited to join the authors on this odyssey of discovery—a journey towards Lean-Agile mastery and value stream management, where the quest for excellence and innovation knows no bounds.
