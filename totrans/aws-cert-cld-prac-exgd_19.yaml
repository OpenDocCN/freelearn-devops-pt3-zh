- en: Many companies looking to move to the cloud have heard of the cost benefits
    associated with shifting from a CAPEX model of investment in IT to an OPEX model.
    CAPEX refers to capital expenditure for the procurement of long-term assets such
    as infrastructure equipment, vehicles, and buildings. A company that purchases
    such assets will own those assets, but this tends to tie up capital that could
    otherwise have been spent on other resources that directly benefit the business.
    Consider a company having access to spare capital to invest in research and development
    of their products and services, as opposed to simply purchasing IT infrastructure
    equipment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OPEX refers to operating expenditure and is an ongoing cost for running a product,
    business, or system. In the context of cloud computing, OPEX is the ongoing cost
    of leasing resources from the cloud provider, such as running a fleet of web servers,
    where the business is charged on a pay-as-you-go model. The idea that you do not
    need to tie up vast amounts of capital in expensive hardware equipment (which
    depreciates rapidly), or expensive software licenses for your on-premises infrastructure,
    is a critical factor for your company's financies.

    The solutions you design to host your applications in the cloud need to be cost-optimized
    and architected to ensure you get the best value for your dollar. The good news
    is that with a cloud provider such as AWS, the solutions you design can be highly
    cost-effective. For one thing, you can ensure that you only pay for services when
    you consume them. In addition, each service offering has various options to minimize
    costs that you can configure, based on your access patterns and core business
    requirements.

    *storage*, and *outbound data transfers* you perform. There are some deviations
    to this, but these are the primary cost drivers. With compute, this could represent
    the number of hours that your **On-Demand Instance** is in the running state or
    the number of Lambda executions you perform. With storage, you are charged per

- en: '**Choose the right pricing model**: You can use On-Demand Instances when you
    know that you only need the compute resources for a limited amount of time and
    for a specific short-term project. From a reliability point of view, you need
    to ensure that there are no interruptions to the service, but you are not going
    to be using the resources 24/7, 365 days a year. In this case, an on-demand pricing
    model works well. Alternatively, you can invest in **reserved capacity**, which
    can save up to 72% over equivalent on-demand capacity price, but only if you need
    the resources 24/7, and for a much longer duration, for example, a year. You can
    also consider using **Spot EC2 instances** for applications that are fault-tolerant,
    scalable, or flexible, and where your application can tolerate interruptions.
    Spot instances can save you up to a 90% discount off on-demand prices and there
    is no upfront commitment. Finally, consider opting for the **compute Savings Plans**
    to reduce EC2, Fargate, and Lambda costs. EC2 Savings Plans can deliver savings
    of up to 72% on your AWS compute usage. Here, you make a commitment to a certain
    amount of compute usage, and you are automatically charged at the discounted savings
    plan prices.'

    stopping the instances during periods when they are not in use. You can use **AWS
    Instance Scheduler**, which is a CloudFormation template offered by AWS that can
    help reduce costs by configuring start and stop schedules for your Amazon EC2

- en: Businesses across the globe of all sizes can benefit from moving their applications
    and workloads to the cloud and gain a competitive advantage from the vast array
    of services on offer by AWS. AWS enables customers to build highly available,
    fault-tolerant, scalable, and resilient cloud solutions. AWS offers some of the
    latest and greatest cutting-edge technologies to help you design and build robust
    application solutions. Without AWS, the cost of provisioning the vast pool of
    services and resources alone would make it impossible for many companies, including
    start-ups, to innovate.

- en: One of the prime drivers of cloud adoption is the fact that companies can save
    on capital expenses and opt for a variable expense model for all their IT investments.
    This allows businesses to channel more of the previous capital into improving
    their products and services. However, careful planning and monitoring are required.
    It is all too easy to spin the instances and other resources and incur unnecessary
    costs, especially where you may have overprovisioned the infrastructure required
    to support your applications. This clearly defeats one of the primary reasons
    for moving to the cloud.

- en: In this chapter, you learned about the principles of cost optimization, and
    the approaches you can take to ensure you consume the right services at the right
    price. You learned how to provision resources when you need them most and not
    have idle resources simply sitting around gathering dust. Different pricing options
    for different workload types enable you to make sensible decisions about your
    investment. In addition, AWS offers a number of different management and monitoring
    tools to help you stay well informed about your spending. Using Cost Explorer,
    cost and usage reports, and AWS Budgets, you can run a tight ship if you implement
    best practices and plan your solutions carefully.

    the investment required for implementing solutions on AWS and how migrating your
