- en: This final chapter before the conclusion will deal with anti-patterns centered
    around the way you communicate architecture to different audiences, incorporating
    insights from the new change management section. The first part describes an anti-pattern
    related to information control. Then, we look at a few anti-patterns that relate
    to the clarity of your communication. Third, we examine an anti-pattern specifically
    concerning the way you create architectural artifacts. Finally, we will look at
    how to avoid underestimating the challenge posed by change management. As we’ve
    been doing all along, we will end the chapter by summarizing our key takeaways.
