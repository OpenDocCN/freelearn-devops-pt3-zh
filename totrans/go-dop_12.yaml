    kind of work reduces our teams' development velocity and, just as critically,
    grinds away the morale of the DevOps or **Site-Reliability Engineering** (**SRE**)
    team over time. Toilsome tasks are manual, and by their nature, manual tasks are
    error-prone. If we don't try to replace these tasks with appropriate automation,
    more will accumulate, worsening the situation.

    workflows and is free for any open source project. GitHub Actions pairs a robust,
    customizable workflow engine with an equally powerful event model to trigger automation.
    The patterns and practices used in this chapter will leverage GitHub Actions but
    are transferable to many other developer workflow automation tools such as Jenkins
    and GitLab CI. The choice to use GitHub Actions is driven by the ubiquitous access
    for open source developers and the access to a wide community of contributed actions
    that amplify productivity.

    An event like a pull request can trigger a set of tasks to be executed. An example
    is a pull request triggering a set of tasks to clone the Git repository and execute
    `go test` to run Go tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GitHub Actions is extremely flexible, enabling developers to author a wide variety
    of automations, even some that you might not normally associate with a traditional
    continuous integration/release pipeline. Actions are also composable, enabling
    groups of tasks to be packaged together as a published action and used in workflows
    together with other actions.

- en: A workflow is an automation file written in YAML that lives in a GitHub repository
    in the `./github/workflows/` folder. A workflow consists of one or more jobs and
    can be scheduled or triggered by an event. A workflow is the highest-level component
    of a GitHub Action.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Workflows require a developer to specify the events that will trigger automation
    via the `on` key and the jobs that automation will execute when it is triggered
    by the `jobs` key. Often, a name is also specified by the `name` keyword. Otherwise,
    the workflow will take the short name of the file that contains the workflow YAML.
    For example, the workflow defined in `./github/workflows/foo.yaml` will have the
    default name of `foo`.

    in a variety of flavors: webhook events, scheduled events, and manually dispatched
    events.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Webhook events can originate from an activity within the repository. Examples
    of triggering activities are pushing a commit, creating a pull request, or creating
    a new issue. Events raised from repository interactions are the most common triggers
    for workflows. Webhook events can also be created through external systems and
    relayed to GitHub through the repository dispatch Webhook.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a defined schedule. Schedule events are a way to automate repetitive tasks, such
    as performing issue maintenance on older issues in GitHub or running a nightly
    reporting job.
  prefs: []

    manually. For example, a project may have a Twitter account associated with it,

    and conditionals to provide expressiveness in your workflows. This will not be
    an exhaustive study of all of these items, but we will highlight the most critical
    items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Context variables
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Context variables provide a way to access information about workflow runs, environment,
    steps, secrets, and so on. The most common context variables are `github`, `env`,
    `secrets`, and `matrix`. These variables are treated as maps and can be indexed
    using variable names and property names. For example, `env['foo']` resolves to
    the value of the `foo` environment key.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `github` context variable provides information about the workflow run and
    contains information such as the `ref` that the workflow is executing on. This
    is useful if you would like to use that information to inject a version into an
    application at build time. You can access this information by indexing the `github`
    variable with `github['ref']` or `github.ref`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `env` context variable contains environment variables specified for the
    workflow run. The values can be accessed by using the index syntax.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `secrets` context variable contains the secrets available for the workflow
    run. These values can also be accessed by the index syntax. Note that these values
    will be redacted in the logs, so the secret values will not be exposed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `matrix` context variable contains information about the matrix parameters
    you configure for the current job. For example, if you want to run a build on
    multiple operating systems with multiple versions of Go, the matrix variable allows
    you to specify the list of each one, which can be used to execute a set of concurrent
    job executions using each combination of operating system and Go version. We will
    go into more detail about this when we talk about jobs.

    context variable and verify that one of the labels on the pull request is named
    `safe to test`. This is useful if you want to ensure that a workflow only executes
    after a repository maintainer has had an opportunity to verify that the pull request
    is safe.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A job is a collection of steps that run on an individual compute instance, or
    runner. You can think of a runner as a virtual machine for running your job. Jobs,
    by default, execute concurrently, so if a workflow defines multiple jobs, they
    will execute concurrently if enough runners are available. Jobs have the concept
    of dependency where a job can be dependent on another job, which will ensure the
    jobs execute sequentially rather than concurrently.
  prefs: []

- en: Jobs require a developer to specify an ID of the job, the type of runner the
    job will execute on using the `runs-on:` key, and a sequence of steps the job
    will execute using the `steps:` key. The `runs-on:` key is particularly interesting
    to us, as it is useful for executing a job on different **operating system** (**OS**)
    platforms such as multiple versions of Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the `runs-on:` key, a job is able to run on a specified platform, but that
    does not allow us to make a matrix of jobs to run on multiple platforms concurrently.
    To enable a job to execute in a matrix of configurations, one must use the `strategy:`
    key and expressions. By configuring the strategy, we can build a matrix of jobs
    executing the same job configuration. You will find an example of this configuration
    in the following example.

    of the job's associated runner. Steps can consist of a shell command or an action.
    Since steps execute in the same runner, they can share data between each of the
    steps. For example, if you create a file on the filesystem of the runner in a
    previous step, subsequent steps will be able to access that file. You can think
    of a step running within its own process and that any changes to environment variables
    will not carry over to the next step.

    the environment variables using the `env:` key and the working directory using
    the `working-directory:` key, and also to change the name that appears in the
    GitHub user interface for the step by using the `name` key. There are a wide variety
    of other options to customize the execution of steps, but we will not go into

    Container-based actions use a Dockerfile or a container image reference as the
    entry point, the starting point of execution for the action, and are useful if
    you want to author an action in anything but JavaScript or existing actions. Container-based
    actions offer flexibility in customizing the execution environment of an action,
    but it comes at the cost of start up time. If a container-based action depends
    on a large container image or a slow-building Dockerfile, then the action start
    up time will be adversely affected. JavaScript actions can run directly on the
    runner machine and are the native expression of an action. JavaScript actions
    start up quickly and can leverage the GitHub Actions Toolkit, a set of JavaScript
    packages to make creating actions easier. Composite actions are a collection of
    steps within a wrapper action. They enable an author to combine a set of disparate
    steps into a higher-order behavior.'

    the preceding sample, we used `devopsforgo/sample-action@v1` to specify that we
    wanted to use the action at the Git tag of `v1`. By specifying that version, we
    are telling the workflow to use the action at the Git reference pointed to by
    that tag. By convention, the `v1` tag of an action can point to any Git reference
    that is tagged in the semantic version range of `v1.x.x`. That means that the
    `v1` tag is a floating tag and not static, and will advance as new releases in
    the `v1.x.x` range are released. Recall from the description of semantic versions
    earlier in this chapter that increments of the major version indicate breaking
    changes. The author of the action is making a promise to users that anything tagged
    with `v1` will not include breaking changes.

    workflow, which will tag the action with the major version and announce through
    Twitter that the action release is available.

    action to the GitHub Marketplace. The first publication of your GitHub Action
    is a manual process and can be accomplished by following the guide here: [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace).
    After taking this first set of manual steps, they will not need to be repeated
    for future releases.'

- en: GitHub Actions is a powerful system for project maintainers to automate toilsome
    processes, enabling greater developer satisfaction and increased project velocity.
    We targeted Go in this chapter as the language of choice for GitHub Actions due
    to its type safety, low memory overhead, and speed. We believe that it is the
    best choice for writing GitHub Actions. However, many of the skills taught here
    are transferable to other languages. Each of the patterns, continuous integration,
    release pipelines, semantic versioning, and action creation can be applied to
    any project that you come into contact with.

    in the GitHub Marketplace. By using, building, and contributing to the marketplace,
    an engineer can make their automation more composable and empower community members
    to solve more complex problems through the contributions of the community.

    enable us to be functional quickly. With these basic skills, we were able to build
    a continuous integration automation workflow to clone, build, lint, and test the
    tweeter project. We extended the continuous integration automation to create a
    release pipeline trigger from Git tags. The release pipeline transformed manual
    tasks such as authoring release notes and made them an automated part of the release
    workflow. Finally, we created and published a custom Go GitHub Action that can
    be used by the entire community.

    create automation to eliminate toilsome tasks that burdened your team's day. Remember
    that if you can automate a task that happens once a week and takes an hour, you
    are saving a full week of work from one of your team members! That is time that
    is likely better spent adding value to your business.
