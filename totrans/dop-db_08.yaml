- en: In the field of DevOps, **zero-touch operations** refers to a concept or approach
    where operations and processes related to managing and maintaining *any objects
    or services* (such as databases) are automated to the extent that they require
    little to no manual intervention or human interaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of zero-touch operations is to minimize human involvement and reduce
    the risk of errors or inconsistencies that can occur due to manual processes.
    It involves implementing automation techniques, tools, and workflows that streamline
    and simplify various tasks associated with database management, deployment, monitoring,
    scaling, and recovery.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With zero-touch operations, routine and repetitive tasks such as provisioning
    new database instances, applying patches and updates, monitoring performance,
    optimizing configurations, and managing backups can be performed automatically
    through scripts, configuration management tools, or **Infrastructure as Code**
    (**IaC**) solutions. This allows for faster and more efficient operations, reduces
    the chances of human error, and enables teams to focus on higher-value activities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By leveraging automation, zero-touch operations can help improve reliability,
    scalability, and consistency across database environments. It also enables teams
    to adopt **continuous integration and continuous deployment** (**CI/CD**) practices,
    where changes to databases can be automatically tested, validated, and deployed
    without manual intervention.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, it’s important to note that achieving a fully **zero-touch** state
    may not always be feasible or practical in all scenarios. Certain exceptional
    cases or critical situations may still require human intervention or decision-making.
    Nonetheless, the aim is to minimize manual effort and maximize automation wherever
    possible to streamline database operations.
