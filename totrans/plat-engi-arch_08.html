			<p><st c="1506">Cost management</st><a id="_idIndexMarker837"/><st c="1522"> in platform engineering begins with a good understanding of cost drivers</st><a id="_idIndexMarker838"/><st c="1595"> within your infrastructure and how some platform components might influence those. </st><st c="1679">Cost drivers are also elements that directly impact the total cost of your operations. </st><st c="1766">Understanding and later identifying these can help in making informed decisions to provide cost-oriented and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1875">optimized platforms</st><a id="_idTextAnchor433"/><st c="1894">.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor434"/><st c="1895">To cloud or not to cloud – that’s the question</st></h2>
			<p><st c="1942">For the past few years, there has been almost no way around a cloud adoption strategy. </st><st c="2030">During those years, the movement has faced counterweights from companies that have successfully de-migrated, claiming that their on-premise setup is cheaper, better, and all they need. </st><em class="italic"><st c="2215">Repatriation</st></em><st c="2227"> is what this is called. </st><st c="2252">The numbers of those doing this are not very clear and strongly depend on what is considered part of it. </st><st c="2357">It became very famous as </st><em class="italic"><st c="2382">HEY/Basecamp/37signals</st></em><st c="2404">, and their CTO David Heinemeier Hansson stated that </st><em class="italic"><st c="2457">they will save over $7m over the next 5 years</st></em><st c="2502"> if they do not run on the cloud. </st><st c="2536">A dead stupid side-by-side comparison of their purchased servers that cost them half a million dollars versus their insane yearly cloud spend of $1.9 million makes the math </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2709">complete </st></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="2718">[1]</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="2721">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="2722">Sure—Basecamp or HEY is not comparable with an enterprise, is it? </st><st c="2789">From my own experience, I can tell that running even larger companies’ hardware in their own data center is cheaper than going to the cloud. </st><st c="2930">A key factor is the amount of data and how dynamic and scalable the infrastructure has to be for it. </st><st c="3031">Calculating data in petabytes will quickly turn the cloud into a money sink without an end. </st><st c="3123">A relatively static workload will also drastically reduce the benefits that are included, and it has many other drawbacks. </st><st c="3246">On the other hand, the cloud market is growing continuously every year, with no end in sight. </st><st c="3340">So, to come to a decision on what is the right way to go, you have to consider many moving parts, from a simple cost comparison to available skills and the actual demand of your business. </st><st c="3528">Doing a full assessment of whether the cloud makes sense for you can be a project in itself. </st><st c="3621">But we wanted to give you some ideas on criteria to consider if you are at </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3696">this point:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3707">Cost</st></strong><st c="3712">: Evaluate initial CapEx or one-time costs for on-premise versus OpEx or continuous, subscription-like costs for cloud services, considering long-term financial impact but also that you will save the most money on cloud computing if you pay for 1 or 3 years upfront. </st><st c="3980">This is almost like buying </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4007">the hardware.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4020">Scalability</st></strong><st c="4032">: Assess your demand to scale resources dynamically in response to fast changes. </st><st c="4114">A hint here: if the spikes are too fast, a static server might be better for the user experience than waiting for minutes until new </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4246">instances start.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4262">Reliability</st></strong><st c="4274">: Evaluate uptime guarantees, redundancy, and failover capabilities to maintain continuous operations. </st><st c="4378">Have a look at the history of outages. </st><st c="4417">Some cloud providers frequently </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4449">have issues.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4461">Compliance</st></strong><st c="4472">: Ensure adherence to legal and regulatory requirements, focusing on data residency and sovereignty. </st><st c="4574">You have to sharpen your point of view on sovereignty before you can decide. </st><st c="4651">Unfortunately, this term has more of a spectrum than a clear list </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4717">of requirements.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4733">Integration</st></strong><st c="4745">: Ensure compatibility with existing systems and software, and availability of APIs and integration tools. </st><st c="4853">The provider should support </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4881">infrastructure as code</st></strong><st c="4903"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="4905">IaC</st></strong><st c="4908">), especially</st><a id="_idIndexMarker839"/><st c="4922"> to programmatically create accounts, users, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4967">and permissions.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4983">Support</st></strong><st c="4991">: Assess the availability and </st><a id="_idIndexMarker840"/><st c="5022">quality of technical support, along with </st><strong class="bold"><st c="5063">service-level agreements</st></strong><st c="5087"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="5089">SLAs</st></strong><st c="5093">). </st><st c="5097">Conduct research on other users’ satisfaction with the given support; just because you have a contract that someone keeps your system up and helps you doesn’t mean that the service is </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5281">also good.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5291">Development of new services</st></strong><st c="5319">: Evaluate the speed and number of new features the provider gives you. </st><st c="5392">Consider that there can also be too many updates per month but also that there are barely any </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5486">new features.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5499">Geographic considerations</st></strong><st c="5525">: Consider the proximity of data centers to end users and the regional availability of services. </st><st c="5623">If your company develops globally</st><a id="_idIndexMarker841"/><st c="5656"> available </st><strong class="bold"><st c="5667">software as a service</st></strong><st c="5688"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="5690">SaaS</st></strong><st c="5694">), it might be easier to build on a public cloud than to integrate several </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5770">regional providers.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5789">Skill and expertise</st></strong><st c="5809">: Evaluate the availability of skilled personnel and training requirements for managing the infrastructure. </st><st c="5918">Consider that you still require practically anyone from any IT subject who can do that. </st><st c="6006">What does a short-term plan look like? </st><st c="6045">What is needed in the long run? </st><st c="6077">Forget about cloud computing being easy; most enterprises struggle because they don’t get their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6173">teams educated.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="6188">Environmental impact and sustainability</st></strong><st c="6228">: Consider the provider’s energy consumption, carbon footprint, and sustainability practices. </st><st c="6323">How do they manage their wastewater? </st><st c="6360">If they buy carbon offsets, keep in mind that you have to pay for them, as they theoretically increase </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6463">electricity costs.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="6481">Cloud has often one very strong point: almost nothing hinders you from just starting right away. </st><st c="6579">You can find tons of templates, blueprints, and examples. </st><st c="6637">And within a short time, you are up and running, having your first environment available as </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6729">a platf</st><a id="_idTextAnchor435"/><st c="6736">orm.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor436"/><st c="6741">When we opt for the cloud – we have to consider its hidden costs</st></h2>
			<p><st c="6806">As we focus primarily </st><a id="_idIndexMarker842"/><st c="6829">on the cloud in this book, we will assume for now that those who go the bare-metal way have by nature a higher cost awareness </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6955">and sensitivity.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6971">Cloud providers give us services</st><a id="_idIndexMarker843"/><st c="7004"> on hand with a lot of </st><em class="italic"><st c="7027">batteries included</st></em><st c="7045">. They often come with backup solutions, scalability, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="7099">high availability</st></strong><st c="7116"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="7118">HA</st></strong><st c="7120">), and a centrally managed service. </st><st c="7157">When planning the cloud infrastructure, most of the time, we will find hard facts and best guesses. </st><st c="7257">Hard facts are information such as how many CPUs or servers are needed, which database should be used, whether it is a single node or HA, and so on. </st><st c="7406">However, you should be aware that almost every option you take with a public cloud provider will have some </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7513">cost impacts.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7526">Big cost drivers</st><a id="_idIndexMarker844"/><st c="7543"> that commonly appear include </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7573">the following:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="7587">Load balancer</st></strong><st c="7601">: They are</st><a id="_idIndexMarker845"/><st c="7612"> required in almost every architecture, and the same goes for you. </st><st c="7679">As explained earlier, we have possibilities to extend the app services from the Kubernetes namespace to the cloud and even control the network – a major </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7832">cost trap.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="7842">API gateway</st></strong><st c="7854">: The even </st><a id="_idIndexMarker846"/><st c="7866">more evil twin of the load balancer, applied as best practice, becomes very costly, especially for chatty systems and routing </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7992">heavy communication.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8012">Data</st></strong><st c="8017">: In rest or in transit, data</st><a id="_idIndexMarker847"/><st c="8047"> quickly becomes the biggest cost block in a cloud bill. </st><st c="8104">While everything can be scaled up and down, your data has to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8165">live somewhere.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8180">Backups and snapshots</st></strong><st c="8202">: They are </st><a id="_idIndexMarker848"/><st c="8214">very much needed for a mature platform; you are required to have a very</st><a id="_idIndexMarker849"/><st c="8285"> good backup strategy that is lean </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8320">but reliable.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8333">Scalable</st></strong><strong class="bold"><st c="8342"> managed services</st></strong><st c="8359">: If you’re</st><a id="_idIndexMarker850"/><st c="8371"> using serverless, message streaming, or pre-trained AI models—anything that can scale infinitely—it’s crucial to set limits to avoid incurring </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8515">unexpected costs.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="8532">Ideal cloud projects—and we have to emphasize here that we are talking about things with a deadline—are strictly opinionated, following the best practices of the cloud provider. </st><st c="8711">Almost every cloud project is not ideal, causing friction in the migration by custom implementations that are needed to somehow make the old world and the cloud provider able to work with each other. </st><st c="8911">These hidden costs accrue through missing skills, because where should the required skills suddenly come from? </st><st c="9022">Getting help from external skill providers would mean they have to understand you first before they can actually help you. </st><st c="9145">However, most cloud projects would be called dead way earlier without </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9215">external support.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9232">In short, we can say that most services can turn against you cost-wise. </st><st c="9305">As platform engineers, we have to be able to control these elements and create guardrails and limitations. </st><st c="9412">To enable this, we need transparency</st><a id="_idTextAnchor437"/> <span class="No-Break"><st c="9448">about costs.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor438"/><st c="9461">Where to find transparency</st></h2>
			<p><st c="9488">Meanwhile, we have a zoo of possibilities for retrieving information about where we spend money and whether this is considered a waste based on metrics such as utilization. </st><st c="9662">All cloud providers offer the possibility of exploring (and exploding) costs, but due to the focus on the infrastructure, details are missing, especially on the application layer. </st><st c="9842">Looking at the following </st><a id="_idIndexMarker851"/><st c="9867">screenshot from AWS Cost Explorer, we get a consumption graph of different service types. </st><st c="9957">We now would need to apply filters to gain more insights and analyze the roots of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10039">the costs:</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="13370">In recent years, FinOps has gained some </st><a id="_idIndexMarker855"/><st c="13411">popularity and is trying to differentiate itself from classic cost management. </st><st c="13490">Cost management is often outlined as a short-term, siloed, single-purpose activity that should yield fast cost savings. </st><st c="13610">When you, as a platform team, act cost-aware and actively manage your costs, this will also be a sustainable and long-lasting solution. </st><st c="13746">But where FinOps succeeds is in its holistic approach, which includes procurement departments, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="13841">business units</st></strong><st c="13855"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="13857">BUs</st></strong><st c="13860">), and </st><a id="_idIndexMarker856"/><st c="13868">finance departments, clearly targeting implementing an organizational understanding of cloud costs and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13971">their dynamics.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="16331">Tags</st><a id="_idIndexMarker858"/><st c="16336"> and labels</st><a id="_idIndexMarker859"/><st c="16347"> will most likely be nothing new to you as they are used in a wide range of tools, public cloud, and Kubernetes. </st><st c="16460">We will use the word </st><em class="italic"><st c="16481">tag</st></em><st c="16484"> also to represent labels, but when using the word </st><em class="italic"><st c="16535">labels</st></em><st c="16541">, we actually exclusively write about </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="16579">Kubernetes labels.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="16597">Applying and using tags can become an art in itself. </st><st c="16651">If there are too many tags, it can become unclear what information they should attach to the service. </st><st c="16753">Also, having no tags is obviously not helpful. </st><st c="16800">In organizations with many different BUs and departments involved and complex release mechanisms, tags can become overloaded or just a collection of abbreviations. </st><st c="16964">The point is that we need tags to gain transparency on services to whom they belong, maybe indicating different service levels or security classes and becoming in the end an anchor to match those services to cost structures and resource utilizations. </st><st c="17215">So, tags allow a more precise analysis of cost-related resources </st><a id="_idTextAnchor443"/><st c="17280">and the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="17288">cost cause.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor444"/><st c="17299">Using tags for a purpose</st></h2>
			<p><st c="17324">Tags</st><a id="_idIndexMarker860"/><st c="17329"> can target different target groups and users. </st><st c="17376">Depending on which subdomain you are asking about, they should include organizational, operational, security, or even architectural information. </st><st c="17521">We can also think about potentially helpful tags for us as </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="17580">platform engineers.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="17599">Tags for organizational information can define which department, role, or team is responsible for the service, whether it is an internal- or external-facing solution, and whether there are any country, compliance, or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="17817">governance restrictions.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="18116">For domain-specific areas such as security or a platform team, we can think of tags and labels as defining a required isolation or data protection, or else like a typical scaling pattern, top and bottom spikes, or identification for a microservice architecture and its belonging to certain components and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="18422">a structure.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="22260">Besides that, you will find other limitations such as the maximum number of tags per account </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="22354">or subscription</st><a id="_idTextAnchor447"/><st c="22369">.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor448"/><st c="22370">Defining a tagging strategy</st></h2>
			<p><st c="22398">As </st><a id="_idIndexMarker869"/><st c="22402">explained earlier, tags can have many different purposes; primarily, we have to balance between technical tags and business tags. </st><st c="22532">Business tags can be categorized into organizational and cost tags. </st><st c="22600">In the end, many tags tend to have overlapping information. </st><st c="22660">Therefore, to find the right approach, it often makes sense to set some basic rules and boundaries for the definition. </st><st c="22779">In the second step, you have to coordinate between operations, platform, and development to find the right set of needed tags from the technical side before moving on to set organizational tags. </st><st c="22974">This direction makes sense because, often, required tags for operation also contain information about </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23076">the organization.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="23093">Let’s start with some common </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23123">ground rules:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="23136">Tag names and values </st><em class="italic"><st c="23158">must</st></em><st c="23162"> be shorter than </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23179">63 characters.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="23193">Tags can be </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23206">only alphanumeric.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="23224">Tags can only have </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="23244">-</st></strong> <span class="No-Break"><st c="23245">and </st></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline"><st c="23249">_</st></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="23250">.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="23251">Focus on tag value and its content as you usually filter and search </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23320">for this.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="23329">Tag names are more relevant for sorting </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23370">and grouping.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="23383">Don’t write </st><strong class="bold"><st c="23396">personally identifiable information</st></strong><st c="23431"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="23433">PII</st></strong><st c="23436">) into</st><a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> <span class="No-Break"><st c="23443">a tag.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="23450">Establish one case style. </st><st c="23477">Businesses might prefer the Pascal style, while in tech, the kebab style is </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23553">more common.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="23565">It is better to use more tags than less, but try to keep 10%-20% of available </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23644">tags free.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="23654">Based on those rules, we can create the next relevant elements. </st><st c="23719">First, we need to think about tagging categories for these to become more fine-grained than those we have discussed so far. </st><st c="23843">A good practice is to think of the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23878">following categories:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="23899">Ownership—departments, teams, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23930">organizations, streams.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="23953">Environment—whatever your staging </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23988">environments are.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="24005">Project or product—project or product cluster to identify which components </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="24081">belong together.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="24097">Cost center—who is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker871"/><st c="24116"> accountable for it? </st><st c="24137">Are there any shared costs that come </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="24174">on top?</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="24181">Compliance—regulatory restrictions and requirements, policies, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="24249">compliance rules.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="24266">Operational—life cycles, backups, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="24301">maintenance windows.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="24321">From here, we have to work on a naming convention. </st><st c="24373">As mentioned earlier, it’s important not to overload a single tag. </st><st c="24440">Respecting the given rules and limitations and including the nature of many software and system components, a tag convention could look </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="24576">like this:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline"><st c="24586">department=public-relations-content-management</st></strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline"><st c="24633">owner=department-public-relations</st></strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline"><st c="24667">data-classification=personal-identifiable-information</st></strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="24721">In some languages, it is preferred to follow a Pascal (</st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="24777">Hello-My-Name-Is-Pascal</st></strong><st c="24801">) or camel style (</st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="24820">i-Am-A-Camel</st></strong><st c="24833">). </st><st c="24837">The style of writing everything in small letters is called the kebab style. </st><st c="24913">You will have to define those patterns in a very clear way. </st><st c="24973">How many characters should the name have and how many words? </st><st c="25034">Is it more descriptive or just matching what’s been identified? </st><st c="25098">The same counts for the value. </st><st c="25129">Ensure that those conventions are documented, communicated, and included in the onboarding or training for </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="25236">your engineers.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="25251">Now, the last step is to start building up a </st><em class="italic"><st c="25297">tag catalog with these ground rules</st></em><st c="25332">. It is recommended to create those catalogs so that you have a space to describe the meaning, purpose, and addressed group of the tag. </st><st c="25468">This also helps you to keep tags short, as you will not need to add more description to the tags’ value. </st><st c="25573">The following table is a simple example of a tag catalog. </st><st c="25631">It can be extended by the unique demands of the organization. </st><st c="25693">It is important to offload into the catalog any information that you </st><a id="_idIndexMarker872"/><st c="25762">might also need to include in the tag but that makes it artificially long </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="25836">and unreadable:</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="36310">If you are not bound to a region, some regions are cheaper than others; even so, it has no large effect. </st><st c="36416">A strong option at the moment is the utilization of ARM servers. </st><st c="36481">If you are not able to run your own or users’ workload on it, at least introduce it for managed services such as databases. </st><st c="36605">This can cut 20-30% or more </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="36633">of costs.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="42330">However, scaling based on CPU or memory is not always the best option. </st><st c="42402">It’s also not the only one we have, even though most scaling frameworks initially started with just scaling based on CPU and memory as those are the two key limits one can set on Pods </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="42586">or namespaces.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="42600">For services that are optimized for a certain throughput, it would, for instance, make more sense to scale on concurrent incoming requests. </st><st c="42741">Also, for the CPU, instead of scaling based on average CPU utilization, it could be better to scale your system when K8s starts to throttle the CPU for a Pod. </st><st c="42900">In our previous chapter, we mentioned tools such as</st><a id="_idIndexMarker893"/><st c="42951"> KEDA as well as the </st><strong class="bold"><st c="42972">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</st></strong><st c="43005"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="43007">CNCF</st></strong><st c="43011">) Keptn project, which can provide any type of metric from various observability sources (Prometheus, Dynatrace, Datadog, New Relic) to be used for event-driven autoscaling. </st><st c="43186">To see how this works, check out a full example in the Keptn</st><a id="_idIndexMarker894"/> <span class="No-Break"><st c="43246">documentation: </st></span><a href="https://keptn.sh/stable/docs/use-cases/keda"><span class="No-Break"><st c="43262">https://keptn.sh/stable/docs/use-cases/keda</st></span></a><span class="No-Break"><st c="43305">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="43306">The key takeaway is that not every workload is CPU- or memory-bound, and Kubernetes is not limiting you to just defining your scaling rules based on those two key attributes. </st><st c="43482">Defining scaling rules based on what is really allowing your workload to execute more efficiently will also lead to more efficient resource utilization, which leads to a system that is also</st><a id="_idTextAnchor465"/><st c="43671"> optimized </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="43682">for costs!</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="43692">Predictive versus reactive scaling</st></h3>
			<p><st c="43727">It is often assumed that </st><a id="_idIndexMarker895"/><st c="43753">autoscaling works instantly. </st><st c="43782">But that’s not true! </st><st c="43803">Think about Financial One ACME. </st><st c="43835">If on paycheck day everyone wants to check their new account balance, this might mean a 10x spike in regular traffic within the first couple of hours of that day. </st><st c="43998">The cloud vendor, however, cannot guarantee that all those resources are instantly available as you are competing with many other organizations that are also trying to request cloud resources at the same time. </st><st c="44208">On top of that, the workload itself will not be able to process incoming requests instantly as many of those Pods have a certain startup time until they </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="44361">are ready.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="44371">This problem can be solved through predictive scaling. </st><st c="44427">Compared to reactive scaling – which is scaling when we reach a certain threshold, as explained in the previous section – predictive scaling looks into a potential future situation and reacts to it before reaching a threshold. </st><st c="44654">Predictive doesn’t mean we need a magic glass bowl to tell us the future. </st><st c="44728">It can be as simple as starting the scaling a couple of hours before we anticipate a spike in traffic; for example, just ahead of paycheck day or ahead of a marketing campaign that starts at a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="44921">specific time.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="44935">Other predictions can be </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="44961">more dynamic:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="44974">Seasonality</st></strong><st c="44986">: One could be based on seasonality by looking at historical data. </st><st c="45054">E-commerce is a good example where, throughout the year, you have certain dates that see a spike in load, such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday. </st><st c="45198">It’s easy to </st><em class="italic"><st c="45211">predict</st></em> <span class="No-Break"><st c="45218">those spikes!</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="45232">Related data sources</st></strong><st c="45253">: Another one could be to look into other data sources. </st><st c="45310">Insurance organizations often look into severe weather data. </st><st c="45371">When storms are predicted and there is a certain chance that those storms will cause damage, it makes sense to predictively scale services that those clients will use to submit insurance claims. </st><st c="45566">For this particular scenario, you can even scale in specific regions that are closest to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="45655">the storm.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="45665">System dependencies</st></strong><st c="45685">: In complex systems, it is also an option to scale dependent</st><a id="_idIndexMarker896"/><st c="45747"> components based on the load behavior of other parts of the system. </st><st c="45816">Take hospitality as an example. </st><st c="45848">If we see more people searching for flights as they want to get away on a long weekend, we may also predictively scale backend services that provide recommendations for hotels, cars, or additional events to book in </st><a id="_idTextAnchor466"/><st c="46063">the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="46067">travel destination.</st></span></li>

			<p><st c="46285">Our digital systems are generating more data than ever, and it’s predicted that this trend will continue. </st><st c="46392">Storage – while seemingly available in abundance – is a big cost factor for many organizations. </st><st c="46488">The same is true for our Financial One ACME company, assuming we have to store all the details about every financial transaction our systems handle. </st><st c="46637">As an organization, we need to make sure we can always persist all records, but we also want to make sure that we are not paying for storage space we currently don’t need. </st><st c="46809">So, we want to keep our free disk space as small as possible to avoid having to pay for disks we don’t need. </st><st c="46918">On the other hand, we also need to make sure we have enough disk free space in case a spike in transactions comes in as we cannot afford to be able to lose transactions. </st><st c="47088">Considering that scaling disks at a large scale can’t happen instantly but may take a couple of hours, we can apply predictive storage scaling to fulfill all </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="47246">our requirements!</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="50106">From scaling workloads to clusters</st></h3>

			<p><st c="50334">As we scale our workloads up and </st><a id="_idIndexMarker902"/><st c="50368">down, the underlying Kubernetes cluster also needs to be sized accordingly. </st><st c="50444">This is where cluster autoscaling comes in, which will scale up a cluster’s nodes to ensure that enough resources are available to run all workloads, but which will also scale down nodes in case nodes are underutilized and workloads can be distributed across the remaining set of nodes. </st><st c="50731">This ensures that the underlying cluster node machines are optimized, which in the end </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="50818">saves costs.</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="52723">The only request what you need approach</st></h3>
			<p><st c="52763">In the early days of the cloud, many organizations gave their engineering teams full access to cloud portals. </st><st c="52874">This easy “self-service” boosted productivity as everyone could easily stand up new VMs, create new storage services, or even create Kubernetes clusters. </st><st c="53028">This “wild wild west” approach, however, led to cost explosions for many organizations as users were just creating new services but not thinking about the basics, such as: How large a virtual environment do I really need and for how long do I </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="53271">need it?</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="53279">One of the organizations that the authors have worked with is a financial organization. </st><st c="53368">Instead of giving everyone full access to their cloud portals, they built their own self-service portal allowing engineering teams to create new VMs, databases, clusters, and so on. </st><st c="53550">As part of that self-service portal, the team had to define for </st><em class="italic"><st c="53614">which application</st></em><st c="53631"> they needed the resource and for </st><em class="italic"><st c="53665">which environment</st></em><st c="53682">, as well as </st><em class="italic"><st c="53695">how long</st></em><st c="53703"> this machine was needed; for example, only during business hours. </st><st c="53770">The result was a 60% cost reduction as the provisioned services were automatically shut down when no longer needed. </st><st c="53886">The following screenshot shows how engineers request resources for the time they need them. </st><st c="53978">On the right, you also see the detailed reporting and overall optimization goal this organization </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="54076">is achieving:</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="54732">Lease versus flat-rate resource</st></h3>
			<p><st c="54764">The previous example</st><a id="_idIndexMarker907"/><st c="54785"> is great but requires teams to think upfront about exactly how long and when they need certain resources. </st><st c="54892">A different approach to this would be to use a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="54939">lease model</st></strong><st c="54950">. What does </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="54962">this mean?</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="54972">When dev team A requests a resource – let’s say a Kubernetes cluster that they need for some development work – they can simply request it for a default time period; for example, 1 week. </st><st c="55160">That 1-week timeframe becomes their “initial lease” of that resource. </st><st c="55230">Both timeframe and team ownership will be managed through tags on that created resource. </st><st c="55319">Through automation, 1 day prior to the end of the lease, emails or chat messages can be sent to teams reminding them that their lease is about to expire. </st><st c="55473">The message can also give them the option to </st><em class="italic"><st c="55518">extend the lease</st></em><st c="55534"> for another day or week but also remind them about the cost that this extra time </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="55616">would incur.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="55628">This approach has been implemented in several organizations and ensures that any team can still get the resources they need via self-service. </st><st c="55771">It also ensures that resources that are forgotten about or no longer needed will be shut down without having to specify</st><a id="_idIndexMarker908"/><st c="55890"> upfront exactly how long a resource will </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="55932">be needed.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="55942">Now that we’ve talked about how to have resources running only when they are really needed to save on costs, let’s talk about how engineers can also optimize </st><a id="_idTextAnchor473"/><st c="56101">their code to make a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56122">cost impact!</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="56134">Green engineering – optimizing your code</st></h3>
			<p><st c="56175">Efficient</st><a id="_idIndexMarker909"/><st c="56185"> code typically not only executes faster; it typically also needs less CPU, memory, and potentially less disk storage or network bandwidth. </st><st c="56325">Less of everything also means less costs. </st><st c="56367">So, why doesn’t everyone just produce efficient code from </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56425">the start?</st></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="56851">Requesting too much data</st></strong><st c="56876">: Instead of leveraging query languages to only request data needed for a certain operation, more data is retrieved and then filtered and processed in memory. </st><st c="57036">This leads to more network traffic to transfer the data, more memory usage to store the data, and more CPU to iterate and filter in the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="57172">client code.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="57184">Inefficient use of libraries or algorithms</st></strong><st c="57227">: Many software libraries exist to get certain jobs done; for example, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="57299">Object Relational Mappers</st></strong><st c="57324"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="57326">ORMs</st></strong><st c="57330">) to map data in databases to</st><a id="_idIndexMarker910"/><st c="57360"> objects in a development language. </st><st c="57396">Development teams unfortunately don’t always have the time to properly test or configure those libraries to optimize them for their specific use case. </st><st c="57547">This, therefore, results in inefficient use, which leads to higher CPU, memory, network, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="57640">disk access.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="57652">Excessive logging</st></strong><st c="57670">: Software engineers use logging frameworks to log information as their code executes. </st><st c="57758">Logs are typically needed for analytics, diagnostics, and troubleshooting of failed or problematic code executions. </st><st c="57874">Too often, though, logs are created excessively or duplicated without proper formatting or enough contextual information; for example, no log levels are set. </st><st c="58032">This leads to overhead when logs are created but also overhead when those logs are ingested, transformed, and analyzed by </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="58154">observability platforms.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="58178">There are many more </st><a id="_idIndexMarker911"/><st c="58199">patterns in software engineering that lead to performance or scalability issues. </st><st c="58280">Apart from detecting patterns, architectural reviews for applications can also lead to cost reduction through more efficient architectures or rewritten code. </st><st c="58438">A prominent example is Amazon Prime Video, which dumped its AWS distributed serverless architecture and moved to what is described as a </st><em class="italic"><st c="58574">monolith</st></em><st c="58582"> for its video quality analysis, which reduced infrastructure costs by 90% </st><em class="italic"><st c="58657">[4]</st></em><st c="58660">. Ultimately, those patterns also mean inefficient code execution, which results in higher costs. </st><st c="58758">As platform engineering teams, we have the opportunity to analyze those patterns using modern observability tools and bring this information back to the engineers to remind them not only about the costs they incur with their code but also where they can start optimizing, as shown in the next screenshot. </st><st c="59063">These two charts show how many logs are created per service and also highlight which logs do not have proper configurations; for example, no log </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="59208">levels set:</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="59857">While this may not</st><a id="_idIndexMarker912"/><st c="59876"> stand out as a top role of a platform engineering team, as engineering teams use our platforms to deploy their applications as self-service , we can use that platform to also educate everyone about the cost impact they have when using the platform to get their software </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="60147">services deployed.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="60165">In the previous sections, we already highlighted use cases such as sending cost and usage reports to engineering teams or identifying and highlighting inefficient code patterns. </st><st c="60344">The key enabler to this is proper tagging (for example, who owns which part of the infrastructure and applications), as well as good observability (for example, which systems use how much CPU, memory, network, etc.). </st><st c="60561">Having this information allows platform engineering teams to push this data to teams proactively and, with this, show them continuously what cost impact their applications have. </st><st c="60739">Doing this continuously will also result in an educational effect that will lead to engineers having a better upfront understanding of </st><a id="_idTextAnchor475"/><st c="60874">the cost impact their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="60896">actions have.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor476"/><st c="60909">Summary</st></h1>
			<p><st c="60917">In this chapter, you should have developed a sense of costs and had ideas on how you can address this topic on your platform. </st><st c="61044">Good platforms provide transparency for their user and enable the use of flexible options to adjust their workload for different triggers. </st><st c="61183">At this point, you should be able to combine the learned approaches from previous chapters, such as dynamic resource allocation with GPUs, to create high utilization and optimal </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="61361">cost allocation.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="61377">Remember that the cost perspective alone isn’t enough to reduce overall platform costs, as some reductions in server sizes might increase the demand on multiple small ones due to other limitations that cloud providers have. </st><st c="61602">A tagging strategy builds the core for control and transparency. </st><st c="61667">What sounds easy can end in many organizational discussions. </st><st c="61728">To optimize your costs, you can also leverage other elements such as processes, and agree on long-term commitments to get better </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="61857">pricing deals.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="61871">Finally, we gave you some practical examples and best practices for your platform to include. </st><st c="61966">We caught up on the different approaches of scaling and the difference between predictive and reactive scaling, and shone a light on other scaling factors besides CPU, such as memory </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="62149">and storage.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="62161">To summarize, when you think rationally and treat the money you spend on the platform like it is your own, then you can become very cost-efficient. </st><st c="62310">As a platform engineering team, you could also develop a metric to define how efficient the platform is to be able to agree with your management on using this free budget for further investments and optimizations. </st><st c="62524">Remember that even though the cloud gives us an </st><em class="italic"><st c="62572">unlimited</st></em><st c="62581"> amount of resources, we don’t have to take all of them just because they </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="62655">are there.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="62665">Let us head straight to our final chapter. </st><st c="62709">As we already said earlier, the only consistency is inconstancy. </st><st c="62774">In our last chapter, we will therefore talk about continuous change and how to survive it, considering lightweight architectures motivated by sustainable ideas and the golden path for changes. </st><st c="62967">To close the chapter, we dare to take a look into the crystal ball and cover some technological trends that may or may not be</st><a id="_idTextAnchor477"/><st c="63092">come relevant within the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="63118">next years.</st></span></p>
