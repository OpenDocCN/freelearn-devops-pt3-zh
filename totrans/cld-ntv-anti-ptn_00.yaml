    It can accelerate innovation cycles, improve our time to market, increase resilience,
    improve security posture, and enable observability and flexible integrations for
    data, APIs, and connectivity. Despite all the potential that cloud native brings,
    the authors of this book have seen many things go wrong, were involved in the
    remediation steps across the software development life cycle, and had opportunities
    to start building new capabilities from scratch. A cloud native journey is not
    only about technology and tools. It starts with a cultural transformation, leveraging
    the right ways of working and transforming our company into a learning organization.
    The adoption also requires a shift in governance, security, ownership, and continuous
    improvement of our architecture and skills. With great power comes great responsibility.
    This book provides insights into where cloud initiatives tend to go wrong, how
    to spot those anti-patterns while they are starting to unfold, and how to remediate
    them to drive successful cloud adoption. By reading this book, you will learn
    about the following:'
