			<h1 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Monitoring Component Activity and Metrics Through CheckOps in Compass</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Compass</strong> allows<a id="_idIndexMarker774"/> you and your teams to understand how your software all works together. In a distributed software architecture (microservices), there are many pieces that all come together to build something of value for your customer. Keeping track of all those pieces, and understanding who owns them and how they integrate, can be a challenging task. Compass makes it easy for software teams to catalog their components and be able to visually monitor their components and pull <span class="No-Break">useful metrics.</span></p>
			<p>First, we’ll set up Compass, a separate Atlassian product that integrates with the rest of the Atlassian DevOps tools. Once you have Compass available, you’ll create components, manage your team, create views of your software components, and create metrics to help your team understand how their software components all <span class="No-Break">come together.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter has the <span class="No-Break">following recipes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Configuring Compass</span></li>
				<li>Importing distributed architecture components using a <span class="No-Break">CSV file</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>You will need <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Jira</span></li>
				<li>A Git repository with your <span class="No-Break">team’s components</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Bitbucket Cloud</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Configuring Compass</h1>
			<p>Compass is <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>a standalone Atlassian product that you will need to purchase on its own. Before you can configure Compass, you will want to make sure that your company has a valid subscription to the <span class="No-Break">Compass product.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Getting ready</h2>
			<p>To begin <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>with the recipe, we need to get the setup ready by using the <span class="No-Break">following steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go <span class="No-Break">to (</span><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=compass"><span class="No-Break">https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=compass</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span><p class="list-inset">Once there, you’ll want to sign in using your Google email, work email, or any other email by clicking on <strong class="bold">Sign up </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">with email</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">If you have used any other Atlassian product such as Jira, Confluence, or Bitbucket, you’ll want to use the same account/ID that you use to log in to those products. Ideally, you should be using the same Atlassian ID that you have been using in the <span class="No-Break">previous chapters.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>How to do it…</h2>
			<p>Before Compass can be a useful tool for your team, you need to populate it with components. These components are going to track all the various elements that make up your software stack. Components can be libraries, services, applications, dependencies, or anything that your product needs from a software perspective. Toward the end of this chapter, we have a recipe (<em class="italic">Creating a developer platform with Compass</em>) that covers how Jira and Compass connect to display Compass components within Jira. This is all automated by Atlassian and if your components exist within Compass, they will automatically be displayed <span class="No-Break">in Jira.</span></p>
			<p>There are two different ways to input components into Compass. You can manually create them, which is what we are going to do in this section, or you can import them. We are going to discuss importing components in the next section. For now, let’s create some components the <span class="No-Break">manual way.</span></p>
			<p>Follow these instructions to configure the component catalog <span class="No-Break">within Compass:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>On the navigation bar across the top of Compass, click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button. This is going to give you the option to create a variety of different elements in Compass. For this very first step, we want to <span class="No-Break">select </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Component</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Creating a component can be a bit of an art. You have a variety of types to choose from that are built into Compass. You’ll want to select the type that best describes the component you are trying to create. As discussed in the introduction to this section, a component is a piece of your software picture. Since software is complex, it is composed of many different components. You want to do your due diligence here and capture the components that appropriately describe <span class="No-Break">your software.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Once<a id="_idIndexMarker779"/> you click on <strong class="bold">Component</strong>, you will be prompted to pick the type of component you want to create. Pick from any of the following available options per <span class="No-Break">your choice:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Service</strong> – An independently deployable software unit, usually operated by a person <span class="No-Break">or team</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Library</strong> – A reusable collection of objects, functions, <span class="No-Break">and methods</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Application</strong> – A fully-packaged application, such as a mobile application, desktop application, or a <span class="No-Break">CLI tool</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Capability</strong> – A higher-level product functionality that an end user understands and sees <span class="No-Break">value in</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Cloud resource</strong> – An entity or service provided by a cloud vendor, with consumer-managed configuration <span class="No-Break">and monitoring</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Data pipeline</strong> – A sequence of tools and processes that gets data from a source to a <span class="No-Break">target system</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Machine learning model</strong> – An algorithm that identifies patterns in a set of data and makes predictions <span class="No-Break">over it</span></li><li><strong class="bold">UI element</strong> – Reusable building blocks of a design system that together create patterns and <span class="No-Break">user experiences</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Website</strong> – One or more web pages under a domain, mainly consisting of <span class="No-Break">read-only content</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Other</strong> – A generic software component described <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Other</em></span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">The following<a id="_idIndexMarker780"/> screenshot shows some of the <span class="No-Break">listed options:</span></p></li>

			<p class="callout">As you can see, there is an option for any part of your software. Select the type that most appropriately identifies with the component you are trying to capture. When first starting out, this may be challenging to do, because you might not have all the information captured. This is a good problem to have because part of having a healthy software product requires the team to have a 100% mapping of how all their software comes together. Having gaps in capturing your components can create blindsides that may have detrimental impacts later on in a software product’s <span class="No-Break">life cycle.</span></p>

			<p class="callout">After you have a suitable name, it is time to give someone ownership of the component. One of the most important things about going through this activity is that every component should be owned by someone or some team. This isn’t a required field, but it’s a field that is highly recommended to have populated. Having a team be responsible for a component will give someone ownership of that component. They’ll be responsible for knowing their component inside and out. When bugs start being discovered, you’ll want to know who owns the component. If a component isn’t owned by anyone, that’s okay, you can skip this part, but it is highly recommended that you start assigning owners to <span class="No-Break">your components.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Understanding configuration as code in Compass</h1>
			<p>In the previous two recipes (<em class="italic">Configuring Compass</em> and <em class="italic">Importing distributed architecture components using a CSV file</em>), you learned how to manually create and import components. Both methods require a lot of user input and can be prone to errors. Not <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>only that, but if your component data changes in your repository, someone needs to go into Compass and update the component data there. A better way would be to have the code in your repository update the component information. This can be achieved by utilizing <strong class="bold">configuration as </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">code</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CaC</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>Once you connect your Bitbucket repository with Compass, you’ll be able to use a special YAML file for each of your components. This YAML file exists for each component within your code repository and, best of all, it is version-controlled. Instead of having to update Compass manually or via CSV files, you’ll simply be able to manage all your component data within your code repository and Compass will take care of <span class="No-Break">the rest.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>How to do it…</h2>
			<p>In your code repository, identify the <strong class="source-inline">compass.yml</strong> file. You’ll be providing your component metadata here, which will then make this component(s) a managed component within Compass, which basically means that the data will come from the <strong class="source-inline">.yml</strong> file and not manually <span class="No-Break">from Compass.</span></p>
			<p>The following example will be for a single component that is tracked in your Bitbucket repository using the <strong class="source-inline">compass.yml</strong> file for that component. Each component will need its own <strong class="source-inline">compass.yml</strong> file. Make sure that each unique <strong class="source-inline">compass.yml</strong> file for each unique component is in its own subfolder within your code repository. Let’s use the following steps <span class="No-Break">for it:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Within your code repository, find or create the <strong class="source-inline">compass.yml</strong> file. The following is the sample <strong class="source-inline">compass.yml</strong> file that is created when Bitbucket is connected with Compass. If you have not completed this connection, skip down the <em class="italic">Integrating Compass with Bitbucket </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Cloud</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section.</span></li>

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">You still need to create the component in Compass. Once the component is created, you will be able to retrieve the unique ID for the component, which will then be used by the <strong class="source-inline">compass.yml</strong> file to manage the component’s metadata. Bitbucket will create a component for you when you connect the repository to Compass, but if you want to track/add multiple components, you are either going to need multiple repositories or you’ll want to manually create the components in Compass and then reference them in multiple <strong class="source-inline">compass.yml</strong> files, sprinkled as appropriate in <span class="No-Break">your repository.</span></p>
			<p class="list-inset">In the<a id="_idIndexMarker814"/> following points, we are first going to break down and explain the contents of this file and then we are going to commit it to Bitbucket, which will then push the data to Compass as a <span class="No-Break">managed component.</span></p>

			<p>Now that all your components are in Compass, it is time to start leveraging Compass to ensure your components are up-to-date and in good <span class="No-Break">working condition.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Creating a developer platform with Compass</h1>
			<p>Compass is <a id="_idIndexMarker820"/>designed to help you gain an entirely new appreciation of how all your code is connected. With all the components in <a id="_idIndexMarker821"/>Compass, it is time to build a developer platform. This platform is going to give you a unified view of all your components, libraries, services, applications, and documentation, and the health and status of whatever you track <span class="No-Break">within Compass.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>How to do it…</h2>
			<p>The first thing we want to do is connect components that are related and highlight their dependencies. These dependencies will show what other components a specific component relies on. Having this mapped out in Compass is crucial to understanding how your software architecture works. Understanding these relationships enables your team to have a better understanding of how components rely on each other to make your <span class="No-Break">software work.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s use<a id="_idIndexMarker822"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker823"/>following steps to create <span class="No-Break">these dependencies:</span></p>

			<p class="callout">Compass allows you to view your dependencies in a list or map view. This will allow you to visualize any circular dependencies that may exist within your components.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>There’s more…</h2>
			<p>Compass has<a id="_idIndexMarker826"/> a built-in functionality that allows you to make announcements about any component in your Compass catalog.

			<h3>Connecting with Jira</h3>
			<p>Jira can <a id="_idIndexMarker831"/>also connect with Compass, and you can visualize Compass data within Jira and vice versa. There used to be two different ways to connect Compass <a id="_idIndexMarker832"/>components with Jira. One was introduced in 2022. Users wanting to integrate Compass with Jira needed to enable a custom field within Jira that would pull in the components from Compass. That field and method were deprecated on May 31, 2024. As a result, the following steps are the best way to ensure that your Compass components<a id="_idIndexMarker833"/> can be used <span class="No-Break">within Jira:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to your <a id="_idIndexMarker834"/>Jira project and click on <strong class="bold">Components</strong> (please note that this works in company-managed <span class="No-Break">projects only).</span></li>

			<p>Connecting Jira <a id="_idIndexMarker837"/>with Compass allows your teams to be much more <a id="_idIndexMarker838"/>efficient and the best part is that you do not need to duplicate data. Instead of having to recreate all your components again in Jira, your team can leverage the same Compass components within Jira. If you use the Jira-only components, you will need to recreate those components in Compass. This will allow Jira to have the latest and most up-to-date components that are pulled in <span class="No-Break">from Compass.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Measuring DevOps health with Compass</h1>
			<p>Connecting <a id="_idIndexMarker839"/>your components with Compass and <a id="_idIndexMarker840"/>mapping out their dependencies is great, but even all of that does not give you a full picture of the health and status of your components.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Utilizing templates in Compass</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Templates</strong> in <a id="_idIndexMarker849"/>Compass allow you to create boilerplate pieces of code that help streamline your software development process. These templates become components in Compass and can be reused as appropriate throughout<a id="_idIndexMarker850"/> your software stack. If your team is repeatedly having to create similar code or configurations, templates can really help your team be more efficient. Your team’s code quality can also improve through the use of templates as you’ll always have a solid foundation to get started with. These templates that you’ll learn how to create don’t have to be components; they can be any useful pieces of code that your team depends <span class="No-Break">on frequently.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>How to do it…</h2>
			<p>The first step in utilizing templates is to connect Compass with Bitbucket. Refer to the <em class="italic">Integrating Compass with Bitbucket Cloud</em> recipe if you have not already connected Bitbucket <span class="No-Break">with Compass.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Implementing developer CheckOps in Compass</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">CheckOps</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker857"/>activity that teams that own the various components of their software systems perform to evaluate the health and status of their components. It is<a id="_idIndexMarker858"/> recommended to conduct a CheckOps at least once a week, but it is up to the individual teams to determine what works for them. At the very least, a CheckOps should be performed at the end of <a id="_idIndexMarker859"/>each software development sprint. Conducting a CheckOps allows teams to review scorecards and the overall health of the component(s) that are assigned to them. If a component is failing, then via the weekly CheckOps, the team can figure out a plan to address the failure and bring the component back to a <span class="No-Break">healthy scorecard.</span></p>
			<p>Conducting a regular CheckOps is a good idea because it allows teams to continuously monitor how the components they are responsible for are performing. Far too often, teams add components into Compass but then do not keep up with the components’ health and status. Allowing for a component to fall behind or degrade in service/reliability can lead to significant software troubles later. Conducting the weekly CheckOps allows teams to consistently review key metrics and adjust on demand, as opposed to waiting until something catastrophic happens to their software. Identifying and addressing issues with a component early and often makes it so that software is of higher quality with fewer <span class="No-Break">issues downstream.</span></p>
			<p>Performing a weekly CheckOps is very simple and straightforward. It is all handled within the Compass application and each team can conduct their own CheckOps based on the components that are assigned to them. If components are not assigned to a team, then it is recommended that the component catalog be reviewed and a team assigned to each component <span class="No-Break">as appropriate.</span></p>
			<p>Up next, we’ll walk you through the steps you need to follow in preparation for conducting your very <span class="No-Break">first CheckOps.</span></p>

			<p>Before you <a id="_idIndexMarker862"/>conduct your very first CheckOps, here <a id="_idIndexMarker863"/>are a few things for you <span class="No-Break">to consider:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gain a comprehensive understanding of how your components both impact and are impacted by other elements within your <span class="No-Break">software architecture.</span></li>
				<li>Record any incidents or anomalies that you may have encountered leading up to your very first CheckOps. You’ll want to record these weekly as you prepare to conduct your CheckOps <span class="No-Break">every week.</span></li>
				<li>Understand the service-level objectives for your component. What are the expectations that your stakeholders have for your specific component? You’ll want to review this weekly to ensure that your component is <span class="No-Break">meeting expectations.</span></li>
				<li>Determine a weekly cadence for your team. Every week, at the same time, your team should come together to conduct its weekly CheckOps. This should be treated similarly to any sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint reviews, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that you have selected your team and initiated a CheckOps, it is time to learn how to conduct the weekly <span class="No-Break">CheckOps meeting.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>There’s more…</h2>
			<p>There is a lot more<a id="_idIndexMarker864"/> to cover, and this section will break down how you should handle your weekly <span class="No-Break">CheckOps meeting.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">As your team prepares for its weekly CheckOps, special attention should be paid to any component that has a scorecard indicating that the component needs some attention. Once you have that information and you have done some analysis/investigation into the root cause, it is time to conduct your <span class="No-Break">weekly CheckOps.</span></p>

				<li value="3">Next, there are three different reflection sections that your team will fill out together. These reflection questions are very similar to those from a traditional sprint retrospective. Let’s discuss what kind of information your team should be providing for each section. You will see the <span class="No-Break">following labels:</span><ol><li class="upper-roman"><strong class="bold">What </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">went well?</strong></span><p class="list-inset">Talk about the positive things that went well for your components this past week. Sometimes, this feels like you are bragging a little bit, but it is very important that you capture the victories that your team had. It helps build a reputation and gives your team the positive reinforcement needed to keep moving in the right direction. Highlight any components that are doing extraordinarily well. Talk about all the positive things that went well and what the team/customer gained because of the items that <span class="No-Break">went well.</span></p></li></ol></li>

In this reflection question, your team should focus on identifying items that maybe went well but could be improved. More commonly, you should capture minor problems and setbacks that the team encountered but was able to fix or resolve quickly. This is a good opportunity to find annoyances with the components and figure out ways to eliminate them. No idea is a bad idea and the team should be encouraged to surface its ideas for improvements. This often requires the team to have a high level of trust and a healthy team environment where ideas can be <span class="No-Break">freely discussed.</span></p></li>

This<a id="_idIndexMarker871"/> is similar to the previous reflection point, but this time, think about anything that needs some improvement. The improvements do not have to be technical, either. Maybe the team needs to improve its documentation or dependencies. Your team should be forward-looking, identifying opportunities where it can better support its components, while also finding ways to increase the quality of the components it is <span class="No-Break">responsible for.</span></p></li>

				<li value="4">The final step of the weekly CheckOps process is to capture any action items that the team needs to take within the next week or two. These action items should be <a id="_idIndexMarker872"/>reviewed every week to ensure that the team is actively working toward closing them out. Capture as <a id="_idIndexMarker873"/>many actions as the team discovers during its CheckOps. Unlike in Confluence, where you can assign the action item to an individual, the team will have to be more diligent and responsible when it comes to closing out items. You also cannot add due dates to these action items, as you can in Confluence, and the action items are not connected to <span class="No-Break">Jira either.</span></li>

			<p>Now that you <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>know how to conduct your weekly CheckOps, in the next section, we’ll discuss some best practices to make sure you and <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>your team are getting the most out of your <span class="No-Break">CheckOps sessions.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>See also</h2>
			<p>Performing a weekly CheckOps is an easy thing to do, but there are a few recommendations that will help boost the effectiveness of your weekly CheckOps. These are the <em class="italic">CheckOps best practices</em>. By following these recommendations, you can help your team maximize the value the team and the rest of your company get from the <span class="No-Break">weekly CheckOps.</span></p>
			<h3>Consistency</h3>
			<p>Do not skip <a id="_idIndexMarker878"/>your weekly CheckOps. Sometimes your team might not have much time, or there may be times when the scorecards are all green. Even if everything is going well, build the habit of always running your weekly CheckOps at the same time every week. If there is a holiday, make sure you schedule around the holiday. Building the habit of always running your CheckOps meeting will ensure that your team treats it as a high-priority item. Then, whenever something goes wrong, your team will already have the muscle memory of knowing how to run CheckOps sessions and will be able to focus on the critical issues as opposed to figuring out how to conduct <span class="No-Break">the meeting.</span></p>
			<h3>Scorecard</h3>
			<p>Continuously <a id="_idIndexMarker879"/>review your scorecard and the metrics that make up your scorecard. Your scorecard is one key indicator that influences what items are discussed during the weekly CheckOps. If the scorecard is always showing positive results, but deep down, something is not working at the software level, review the items that feed into your scorecard. Make sure that they are accurate and that they appropriately tell you what is happening at the software level. Make the appropriate adjustments to your metrics that drive your scorecards to ensure that your component health reflects the most accurate data possible. This will help you have the best weekly CheckOps because you’ll have the most accurate and relevant data to help drive discussions, decisions, and any actions that need <span class="No-Break">to happen.</span></p>
			<h3>Follow through</h3>
			<p>The final <a id="_idIndexMarker880"/>recommendation is to ensure that your team always follows through on your actions. Technical debt builds up real fast if you ignore problems. You do not have to act right away, but every action that is captured during your weekly CheckOps sessions should be addressed before your team gets together again for the next CheckOps session. Failure to act is only going to result in bad metrics becoming even worse over time. An added benefit of following through and acting on the actions is that the team will observe that the actions are being resolved. This will encourage them to identify more inefficiencies and problems with the hopes that they too will <span class="No-Break">be addressed.</span></p>
