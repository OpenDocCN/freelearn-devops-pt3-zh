    to work extremely hard to get this job. In a way I did, but not in the way you
    are probably thinking. I did not work hard to prepare for the interviews, as most
    of the interviews happened without me even knowing I was being interviewed. This
    was because I had built a relationship on LinkedIn with the hiring manager. For
    several months, we had been discussing different job opportunities within the
    organization he worked for, and at the same time, he was getting to know more

    start following and interacting with other DevOps professionals. If you lack DevOps
    connections, an effortless way to ensure you start seeing posts about #DevOps,

    This is not something that has happened to me; it has always been a long game
    when it comes to payoffs from relationships. There was an instance where a recruiter
    reached out to me about a job. At the time, I was not looking for a job change.
    We stayed connected on LinkedIn and met for lunch a few times a year. Three years
    later, a friend and former colleague lost his job after his department was restructured.
    I sent his resume over to the recruiter; within 2 weeks he was starting a well-paying
    contract gig that was able to hold him over while he searched for a more permanent

    This is a good question. First, it cannot be answered with a single-word response;

    sure to follow up and add them on LinkedIn with a message thanking them for the

- en: In this chapter, we discussed several ways of networking, both virtually and
    IRL. We first discussed the best strategies for building relationships on LinkedIn.
    This included ways to increase the probability of you being noticed by others.
    In this section, you also learned ways to utilize your second- and third-degree
    connections to build relationships. The six traits that will improve the likelihood
    of successful conversations, virtually and IRL, were discussed. These consisted
    of being helpful, authentic, personal, consistent, engaged, and professional.
    We discovered that having connections that you interact with is more valuable
    than having many connections that you have no personal relationship with. Events
    that can help facilitate better conversation, such as lightning talks and Lean
    Coffee, were discussed next. Finally, we covered four methods that will drastically
    improve your ability to have meaningful conversations and build relationships
    at networking events. These consisted of coming prepared, showing you care, being
    upfront with your intentions, and knowing when to exit a conversation.
