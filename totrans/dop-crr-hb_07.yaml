    and I have a great manager; a true triple-threat job. You may be thinking I had
    to work extremely hard to get this job. In a way I did, but not in the way you
    are probably thinking. I did not work hard to prepare for the interviews, as most
    of the interviews happened without me even knowing I was being interviewed. This
    was because I had built a relationship on LinkedIn with the hiring manager. For
    several months, we had been discussing different job opportunities within the
    organization he worked for, and at the same time, he was getting to know more
    about my skills and career goals.

    start following and interacting with other DevOps professionals. If you lack DevOps
    connections, an effortless way to ensure you start seeing posts about #DevOps,
    #AWS, #DevOpsJobs, #CI, or anything else, is to follow specific hashtags. This

    This is not something that has happened to me; it has always been a long game
    when it comes to payoffs from relationships. There was an instance where a recruiter
    reached out to me about a job. At the time, I was not looking for a job change.
    We stayed connected on LinkedIn and met for lunch a few times a year. Three years
    later, a friend and former colleague lost his job after his department was restructured.
    I sent his resume over to the recruiter; within 2 weeks he was starting a well-paying
    contract gig that was able to hold him over while he searched for a more permanent
    position.

    First, it will ensure everyone who attends the meetup knows who you are, which
    is great if you are in the market for a career change. It also allows you to add
    *a presenter* to your LinkedIn profile, which is another terrific way to get noticed.

    practice presenting, a skill that will be useful for the rest of your career.

    DevOps or engineering group. When I worked at *Optum*, we incorporated a lightning
    talk at the beginning of our DevOps community office hours calls. It got attendees
    engaged from the start of the call, and also led to great discussions.

    sub-sections, we discussed lightning talks and Lean Coffee events that were purposefully
    designed to inspire conversations. Unfortunately, most networking events consist
    of refreshments and people gathered in a space. The following are a few things
    that have helped me as I matured in my ability to network effectively:'

    conversations with individuals who are at the event.

- en: Ask questions that will give you more information to continue the conversation.
    An example of a poor initial question would be, *Hi, how are you doing?* This
    gives you no information to set up your next question and will lead to a short-lived
    conversation. A better conversation would be, *Hi, I see from your name tag you
    work at Amazon. What is it that you do there that has you interested in containers?*
    This is a good question. First, it cannot be answered with a single-word response;
    second, the response you get will help set up your next question; and finally,
    this question makes it seem as though you are terribly interested in getting to
    know them. Let's pretend the individual is the manager of a team focused on AWS
    **ECS (Elastic Container Storage)**and is interested in Docker to ensure they
    stay at the bleeding edge of what is happening in the container space. The individual
    then turns the question on you, which brings me to the next point.

  zh: 提出能够帮助你获得更多信息以继续对话的问题。例如，一个不太好的开场问题是，*嗨，你怎么样？* 这个问题无法为你设定下一个问题的方向，并且很容易导致对话变得短暂。一个更好的对话会是，*嗨，我看到你在名牌上写着你在亚马逊工作。你在那里做什么工作，为什么对容器感兴趣呢？*
    这是一个很好的问题。首先，它不能用一个单词来回答；其次，你从中得到的回答将帮助你设定下一个问题；最后，这个问题让人觉得你对了解他们非常感兴趣。假设这个人是一个专注于AWS
    **ECS（弹性容器存储）**的团队经理，并且对Docker感兴趣，以确保他们能够紧跟容器领域的最新动态。然后，这个人将问题反问你，这就引出了下一个话题。

- en: If a conversation is going well, for instance, if after you stated your intentions,
    the individual seemed interested in learning more about you, you should spend
    as much time with the individuals as they need. Do not bow out of the conversation
    to move on to the next. You have laid the groundwork; now, it is time to build
    upon the foundation. The opposite of this is when the individual is not interested
    in networking for the sake of hiring someone now; thank the individual for their
    time, and leave by telling them to stay in touch via LinkedIn. Afterward, make
    sure to follow up and add them on LinkedIn with a message thanking them for the
    conversation; you never know when they may be in the market for a candidate.

  zh: 如果对话进行得很顺利，比如在你陈述了自己的意图之后，这个人似乎对了解你更多感兴趣，那么你应该根据对方的需要与他们花费时间交流。不要为了转到下一个人而退出对话。你已经打下了基础，现在是时候在这个基础上继续深入。相反，如果这个人对目前没有招聘需求，并不打算为了招聘某人而进行交流，那么你应该感谢对方的时间，告别时告诉他们保持通过LinkedIn联系。之后，务必跟进并通过LinkedIn加对方为好友，附上一条感谢他们对话的留言；你永远不知道他们什么时候会需要一个候选人。

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we discussed several ways of networking, both virtually and
    IRL. We first discussed the best strategies for building relationships on LinkedIn.
    This included ways to increase the probability of you being noticed by others.
    In this section, you also learned ways to utilize your second- and third-degree
    connections to build relationships. The six traits that will improve the likelihood
    of successful conversations, virtually and IRL, were discussed. These consisted
    of being helpful, authentic, personal, consistent, engaged, and professional.
    We discovered that having connections that you interact with is more valuable
    than having many connections that you have no personal relationship with. Events
    that can help facilitate better conversation, such as lightning talks and Lean
    Coffee, were discussed next. Finally, we covered four methods that will drastically
    improve your ability to have meaningful conversations and build relationships
    at networking events. These consisted of coming prepared, showing you care, being
    upfront with your intentions, and knowing when to exit a conversation.
