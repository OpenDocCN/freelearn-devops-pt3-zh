			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/><st c="1866">Introducing principles as guardrails for decision-making</st></h2>
			<p><em class="italic"><st c="1923">Principles</st></em><st c="1934"> might </st><a id="_idIndexMarker065"/><st c="1941">sound like an old-school approach from the forgotten times of enterprise architects and very stiff organizations. </st><st c="2055">In times when everything becomes agile, principles are the cornerstones for active decision-making. </st><st c="2155">They help cut discussions short and focus on the platform delivery. </st><st c="2223">How are principles different from capabilities or attributes? </st><st c="2285">A platform’s capabilities are the functionalities an IDP can provide or offer. </st><st c="2364">Think about it like you require file storage, and with the specification of a resource definition that you apply within your platform, the system provides you with an S3 compliant bucket. </st><st c="2552">Attributes are a superset of provided capabilities and are actively or passively consumed. </st><st c="2643">If you define a secure platform, that is the attribute, then this might combine the hardening </st><a id="_idIndexMarker066"/><st c="2737">of the nodes, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="2751">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</st></strong><st c="2787"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="2789">CVE</st></strong><st c="2792">) scans, and things such as network encryption and strict </st><strong class="bold"><st c="2851">role-based access control</st></strong><st c="2876"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="2878">RBAC</st></strong><st c="2882">) rules. </st><st c="2892">A </st><a id="_idIndexMarker067"/><st c="2894">principle helps you decide HOW you are going to achieve those capabilities and attributes. </st><st c="2985">Therefore, you will usually encounter two types </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3033">of principles:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3047">General principles</st></strong><st c="3066">: These </st><a id="_idIndexMarker068"/><st c="3075">are organization-wide counting orientation points. </st><st c="3126">A common one from recent years is this: </st><em class="italic"><st c="3166">Data is an asset</st></em><st c="3182">. This translates to the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3207">following meaning:</st></span><p class="list-inset"><em class="italic"><st c="3225">All data is valuable to an organization. </st></em><st c="3267">It’s a measurable resource to which we apply practices to protect and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3337">use it:</st></span></p><ul><li><st c="3344">For each data source, someone </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3375">is responsible</st></span></li><li><st c="3389">Data is made available </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3413">to everyone</st></span></li><li><st c="3424">We will protect data from loss and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3460">security threats</st></span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3476">Specific principles</st></strong><st c="3496">: These</st><a id="_idIndexMarker069"/><st c="3504"> are use-case-oriented principles that can be relevant to others but are meant to target just a small group of people/specialists. </st><st c="3635">An example from the security branch is this: </st><em class="italic"><st c="3680">Any activity is defined by an identity</st></em><st c="3718">. This can be interpreted </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3744">as follows:</st></span><ul><li><st c="3755">For every process in a system, an identity </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3799">is logged</st></span></li><li><st c="3808">Unknown identities are immediately to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3847">be reported</st></span></li><li><st c="3858">Every system requires </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3881">user authentication</st></span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="3900">Having </st><a id="_idIndexMarker070"/><st c="3908">those two principles in mind will drive your decisions in different directions when you design the architecture for your scenario. </st><st c="4039">What you will encounter is that specific principles look like they describe the obvious expectations of a department. </st><st c="4157">But never assume or implicitly expect something if you want to be sure that it is done the way you </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4256">want it.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="4264">Important note</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="4279">Define </st><em class="italic"><st c="4287">explicit</st></em><st c="4295"> rules, guidelines, and frameworks if you have certain expectations of the outcome of one’s activities. </st><em class="italic"><st c="4399">Implicitly</st></em><st c="4409"> requires that one can read your mind and have the same worldview </st><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/><span class="No-Break"><st c="4475">as you.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="4482">Examples of platform and platform engineering principles</st></h3>
			<p><st c="4539">Before moving over to helping you define your own principles, we would like to give you some input </st><a id="_idIndexMarker071"/><st c="4639">on </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4642">possible principles:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4662">Focus on common problems</st></strong><st c="4687">: Identify and prioritize problems that when solved help many departments or people in your organization. </st><st c="4794">Prevent others from reinventing the wheel by eliminating shared issues and snowballing problems that, when cascading down, become bigger </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4931">and bigger.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4942">Don’t reinvent the wheel</st></strong><st c="4967">: Research the market for potential solutions that solve your demands. </st><st c="5039">Periodically recheck homegrown solutions for standard replacements. </st><st c="5107">The market develops faster than we do. </st><st c="5146">Focus on creating value, not </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5175">internal dependencies.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5197">Each customer is important</st></strong><st c="5224">: Every user of your platform is relevant, from large systems to small products. </st><st c="5306">Gather and evaluate every feedback equally. </st><st c="5350">Address everyone’s needs and demands in the same way and provide the same class of service. </st><st c="5442">Consider those inputs as the primary way to define your </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5498">development path.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5515">Eliminate waste</st></strong><st c="5531">: We will build our platform to be as resource-efficient as possible and help our customers be as optimized as possible. </st><st c="5653">We drive transparency on resource consumption and provide options to scale, reduce, and rightsize workload. </st><st c="5761">Together, we develop best practices for developers to understand how they can configure and use advanced technologies for </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5883">more flexibility.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5900">A platform is a product</st></strong><st c="5924">: Recall your product mindset for every decision. </st><st c="5975">Focus on what provides real value to your internal customers, such as developers, operations, security, and others. </st><st c="6091">Ensure features ship fast and have a short feedback loop. </st><st c="6149">Recognize distractions from non-value-driven technologies. </st><st c="6208">Your highest goal is to make your customers want to use your platform, not to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6286">force them.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="6297">Inner source</st></strong><st c="6310">: Every line of code of your platform is accessible to your internal organization. </st><st c="6394">Issues and problems are tracked publicly and their resolution is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker072"/><st c="6458"> documented. </st><st c="6471">Where relevant, maintain a FAQ. </st><st c="6503">Everyone can propose a feature, a bugfix, lines of code, and documentation to improve your platform. </st><st c="6604">Drive community events and foster exchange between you and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6663">all users.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="6673">Those principles try to cover some different viewpoints and levels of detail. </st><st c="6752">Which is the right one for you is difficult to say. </st><st c="6804">Don’t be afraid to adjust wording or the principles over time if you recognize that they </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6893">don’t work.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="6904">Product mindset as the core principle</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="6942">Your internal customers should want to use your platform. </st><st c="7001">They shouldn’t be </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7019">fo</st><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/><st c="7021">rced to.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="7030">Defining your own principles</st></h3>
			<p><st c="7059">After you </st><a id="_idIndexMarker073"/><st c="7070">adapt to the idea of principles, all of them look good, right? </st><st c="7133">Now, the challenge is to define and write them in a way that will be adapted by your team. </st><st c="7224">They need to fit into your wording and your organization’s internal approach to defining </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7313">similar elements.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7330">Principles can be derived from your corporate values, customer feedback, or a team’s internal workshop. </st><st c="7435">Whatever you do, it is important to have transparency about the origin of the principles; otherwise, the team may feel excluded. </st><st c="7564">You will also need to iterate over them a couple of times to sharpen the wording and boil it down to the elemental things. </st><st c="7687">As with all principles, they shouldn’t be too long, but they should also not be too short. </st><st c="7778">The sentences should be structured short and crisp without any nesting or conditions. </st><st c="7864">Conditions are either a sign that you are unsure about the principle or that it can be two principles. </st><st c="7967">The right length is when you address one topic, give it two or three explaining sentences, and maybe a motivation </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8081">or rationalization.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8100">I have seen two ways of writing that are very efficient in defining a principle and finding frequent quotations and adaptation, and sometimes, it’s in Slack/Teams channel descriptions or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8288">email</st><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/><st c="8293"> footers.</st></span></p>
			<h4><st c="8302">Command and rationalize</st></h4>
			<p><st c="8326">The </st><strong class="bold"><st c="8331">command and rationalization</st></strong><st c="8358"> approach usually works well for organizations that have </st><a id="_idIndexMarker074"/><st c="8415">stronger hierarchies, where the platform team may have just been formed or where the whole initiative is looked at with a skeptical eye. </st><st c="8552">This requires a more strict direction for initialization. </st><st c="8610">However, I believe that those principles should be reworked over time and the input of the platform engineering team and end user should </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8747">be gathered.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8759">Here is an outline showing how to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8794">write it:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8803">Title</st></strong><st c="8809">: Every principle has something like a title that should stick in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8876">one’s head.</st></span><p class="list-inset"><st c="8887">The title should be followed by the list </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8929">of commands:</st></span></p><ol><li class="upper-roman"><st c="8941">The initial command sets </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8967">the direction</st></span></li><li class="upper-roman"><st c="8980">Then, there should be a direction on why </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9022">that’s relevant</st></span></li><li class="upper-roman"><st c="9037">After that, there should be some more detailed actions </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9093">to consider</st></span></li><li class="upper-roman"><st c="9104">Then, there should be another action </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9142">or rationale</st></span></li><li class="upper-roman"><st c="9154">Here, the responsibility should be handed over to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9205">the reader</st></span></li></ol></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="9215">Here’s an example based on the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9247">preceding outline:</st></span></p>

			<ol>
				<li class="upper-roman"><st c="9294">Every platform capability must be utilizable by the end user without interacting with the platform </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9393">engineering team</st></span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman"><st c="9409">This enables the self-determination of the user and offloads work from the platform and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9498">DevOps teams</st></span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman"><st c="9510">Don’t prescribe specific ways, but guide through </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9560">best practices</st></span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman"><st c="9574">Open the possibility of full transparency of your end user’s deployments and allow fine-grained access to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9681">operational data</st></span></li>

			</ol></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="9816">As you can see, this style tells the reader what to do. </st><st c="9873">The title is strong and says, </st><em class="italic"><st c="9903">Whatever you do, first think about making it self-service available</st></em><st c="9970">. Take care with such number-style naming first. </st><st c="10019">This doesn’t work if you name every principle with first, primary, or </st><a id="_idIndexMarker075"/><st c="10089">overarching. </st><st c="10102">However, here, you can see that from all of the potential principles you are writing down, this one will always be first, and will most likely overrule </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10254">other principles.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="10271">Sentences II-IV detail and rationalize the first sentence. </st><st c="10331">They provide supportive arguments and guidelines to consider. </st><st c="10393">The closing statement is as important as the title or first sentence. </st><st c="10463">This must be a handover statement. </st><st c="10498">It is like a call to action, but not in a way that asks someone to do something – this is what happened in the sentences before. </st><st c="10627">It must be addressed on a personal level, with a direct speech toward the reader. </st><st c="10709">Have a look at the list of examples for other ideas on how to close </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10777">a principle.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="10789">Platform teams will grow their internal trust and motivation over time, which demands a different style </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10894">of</st><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/><st c="10896"> principles.</st></span></p>
			<h4><st c="10908">We will …</st></h4>
			<p><st c="10918">Mature platform engineering teams </st><a id="_idIndexMarker076"/><st c="10953">and young organizations require principles that call their </st><em class="italic"><st c="11012">WE</st></em><st c="11014"> feeling. </st><st c="11024">This is almost like a vow of brotherhood and sisterhood. </st><st c="11081">However, you also need to know your team well and handle it with care. </st><st c="11152">Not everyone likes this way of defining principles, as they are calling for strong bonds and communication. </st><st c="11260">This is just a personal question and nothing negative, but you might lose valuable team members if you ignore it. </st><st c="11374">This is how I would define a </st><em class="italic"><st c="11403">We </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="11406">will</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="11410"> principle:</st></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="20266">Users</st></strong><st c="20272">: The group of people who are really going to use your platform/product. </st><st c="20346">In our case, it will be developers </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="20381">or DevOps.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="20391">Customers</st></strong><st c="20401">: People who have budget power and/or make decisions for a whole team, department, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="20485">or similar.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="20496">Influencers</st></strong><st c="20508">: Other people who have an interest in your platform, such as security or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="20583">operations teams.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="20600">You are</st><a id="_idIndexMarker088"/><st c="20608"> building your platform for those stakeholder groups, not for yourself! </st><st c="20680">While defining the purpose of your platform, you should look at the different stakeholder groups from different perspectives. </st><st c="20806">Their needs might change over time, which you can find out with frequent iterations and probes. </st><st c="20902">When you define features for the backlog, make clear from which stakeholders those requirements are coming. </st><st c="21010">If some time has passed, usually six months is a good time frame, then you should reprioritize the feature requests with your stakeholders. </st><st c="21150">This, on the other hand, will also impact the purpose of your platform. </st><st c="21222">Let’s look at </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="21236">an example.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="21247">Some while ago, we were asked to stabilize the customer’s platform. </st><st c="21316">We knew a little about the workload, but the overall system was unreliable and barely served as a useful system. </st><st c="21429">Fast forward, after a couple of weeks of work had passed, new stakeholders had popped up. </st><st c="21519">They became interested in the platform as it automatically adjusted its size to fit the workload, and people are generally happy with the fast and uncomplicated onboarding. </st><st c="21692">Besides, a single tenant deployment for strict isolation was given during the former implementation. </st><st c="21793">The new stakeholders were from a data science department and were looking for an easy approach to run their models without becoming experts. </st><st c="21934">The cloud provider they used was already too complex, as they just focused on machine learning. </st><st c="22030">The platform owner agreed to provide a couple of weeks of capacity to implement the tooling on top of the platform needed by the data scientists. </st><st c="22176">Now, being far away from perfection, the implementation and platform were good enough to be easy to use, cheap, and ensured any data protection regulations. </st><st c="22333">Fast forward again to the modern day, and the platform team’s main purpose is to provide for data science teams’ isolated environments, which come with a whole bunch of tools and are torn down when their job is done. </st><st c="22550">Also, the platform can still run any other workloads, there is currently no demand </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="22633">for it.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="22640">This real-world example shows that sometimes the external influence is stronger than your own drive, but it can lead to higher acceptance and adoption throughout </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="22803">the organization.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="22820">Important note</st></p>

			<p><st c="23787">As a platform team, you should first define your target and an ideology you want to follow to fulfill your purpose before you are forced to follow your organization’s structure. </st><st c="23966">Sadly, this leads to political games – how to gain more power, how to have the most users, and who has the best connections for driving decisions. </st><st c="24113">But don’t be too naive to believe that having a nice platform with some fantastic features will be enough to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="24222">be successful.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="30736">A</st><a id="_idIndexMarker097"/><st c="30738"> platform consists of many parts that are constantly evolving. </st><st c="30801">Alongside this development, your users and organization might also evolve. </st><st c="30876">A huge problem we frequently discover is the reluctance to replace some parts of a platform. </st><st c="30969">While there are often arguments about priority or budget, the most common problem is that it can’t be replaced easily. </st><st c="31088">Sometimes, this is because the platform and component are old and literally screwed into each other, and sometimes it is because the technology choice wasn’t good and introduces a chain of dependencies that become hard to replace. </st><st c="31319">But there is also a third reason: forcing your own way of doing things into the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="31399">wrong tool.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="31410">Composability is a principle, maybe an ideology, and definitely an approach and decision-making that platforms should be built on. </st><st c="31542">Components are composable when they interact with each other without the need to develop something in between for translation, such as scripts or serverless functions. </st><st c="31710">Composable components can be replaced with the least effort possible and with the smallest to no impact on the platform functionality. </st><st c="31845">Kubernetes is an environment that drastically supports this approach and becomes, therefore, the de facto standard to create your platform. </st><st c="31985">However, the components of a platform are distributed, and not all of them run on Kubernetes. </st><st c="32079">This makes it a challenge to find the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="32117">right tools.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="32129">Composability also helps in the right adjustment of a platform. </st><st c="32194">A generic, one-size-fits-all platform always sounds good on paper, but it is unrealistic and increases complexity. </st><st c="32309">The more components you have to bring into a platform, the more likely it becomes that they don’t play together well. </st><st c="32427">Therefore, being able to provide adjustments for certain use cases without changing the entire architecture will increase its useability. </st><st c="32565">Another strong benefit of composability is the separation </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="32623">of concerns.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="32635">In </st><a href="B31164_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="32639">Chapter 1</st></em></span></a><st c="32648">, we</st><a id="_idIndexMarker098"/><st c="32652"> highlighted the purpose of a platform as an abstraction layer for Plug and Play specialized solutions. </st><st c="32756">Strictly enforcing composability will cause a lot of work on the organizational level, but it will allow specialized teams to provide their core capabilities right into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="32925">your platform.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="32939">To evaluate if a component for your platform is composable, you have to look for </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="33021">four abilities:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="33036">Orchestrateable</st></strong><st c="33052">: It can run in a modern dynamic environment, such as Kubernetes, without </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="33127">being impacted</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="33141">Modular</st></strong><st c="33149">: It doesn’t require any other tools or has technical pre-conditions, but can utilize those to extend </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="33252">its capabilities</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="33268">Discoverable</st></strong><st c="33281">: It needs to interact with other components following standardized APIs, or following concepts such as the custom resource definition </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="33417">of Kubernetes</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="33430">Autonomous</st></strong><st c="33441">: It must be independent from other extern inputs and operates </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="33505">by itself</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="33514">Now, we know what to look for when designing the platform and choosing platform components. </st><st c="33607">In the next section, you will learn about the things between those components t</st><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/><st c="33686">hat keep the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="33700">platform together.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/><st c="33718">Dependencies and the hidden glue</st></h2>
			<p><st c="33751">No matter how </st><a id="_idIndexMarker099"/><st c="33766">composable the platform </st><a id="_idIndexMarker100"/><st c="33790">components are, there will always be dependencies and some </st><em class="italic"><st c="33849">hidden glue</st></em><st c="33860">. This hidden glue is the information that flows between the components and makes them react to each other. </st><st c="33968">As architects, it is our job to ensure that the information is not contradictory. </st><st c="34050">This information is im</st><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/><st c="34072">portant but not </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="34089">well understood.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="34105">Managing and handling dependencies</st></h3>
			<p><st c="34140">First, let us build on</st><a id="_idIndexMarker101"/><st c="34163"> the composability by visualizing dependencies between components. </st><st c="34230">For this, we can use a simple dependency matrix. </st><st c="34279">This tool can help you make decisions and plan future components. </st><st c="34345">Also, it requires some maintenance effort; many platforms depend on the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker102"/><st c="34416"> knowledge of single engineers and, as the platform becomes more complex over time, documentation does too. </st><st c="34524">Mapping dependencies is therefore the shortest way </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="34575">to transparency.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="34591">In the following example, we have </st><strong class="bold"><st c="34626">tools A-C</st></strong><st c="34635">, such as </st><strong class="bold"><st c="34645">container network interfaces</st></strong><st c="34673"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="34675">CNI</st></strong><st c="34678">) </st><strong class="bold"><st c="34681">1-3</st></strong><st c="34684">. Now, those</st><a id="_idIndexMarker103"/><st c="34696"> tools can be any kind of tool from the reference components list we talked </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="34772">about before.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="34785">In the dependencies, I prefer to be explicit about which kind of dependencies we have there. </st><st c="34879">Therefore, you can use things such as </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="34917">the following:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="34931">Unidirectional and bi-directional dependencies</st></strong><st c="34978">: You can use these to describe whether</st><a id="_idIndexMarker104"/><st c="35018"> tool B</st><a id="_idIndexMarker105"/><st c="35025"> depends on tool A or tool C depends on tool B as tool B depends on </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="35093">tool C.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="35100">Enhancing dependencies</st></strong><st c="35123">: Enhancing </st><a id="_idIndexMarker106"/><st c="35136">dependencies unlocks more capabilities and features if established, but it doesn’t have to be. </st><st c="35231">For example, if you have a tool with manual user management, now you can utilize </st><strong class="bold"><st c="35312">single sign-on</st></strong><st c="35326"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="35328">SSO</st></strong><st c="35331">) for it, which reduces your </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="35361">manual efforts.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="35376">Conflicting dependencies</st></strong><st c="35401">: As</st><a id="_idIndexMarker107"/><st c="35406"> the name suggests, those two things don’t play </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="35454">well together.</st></span></li>

			<p><st c="35668">Have you </st><a id="_idIndexMarker108"/><st c="35678">seen it? </st><st c="35687">In the example of bi-directional dependencies, the relation between tools B and C is not correctly </st><a id="_idIndexMarker109"/><st c="35786">shown. </st><st c="35793">In the column of tool C, the bi-directional market for tool B is missing. </st><st c="35867">When you implement your dependency matrix, you need to give clear guidance on how to track those relationships. </st><st c="35979">I think it is most useful to set the marks for both tools. </st><st c="36038">However, then you have to be clear about the reading direction or you have to introduce more markers. </st><st c="36140">For example, you could use </st><em class="italic"><st c="36167">(u)</st></em><st c="36170"> to define an </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="36184">incoming dependency.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="36204">Dependency management is a continuous task. </st><st c="36249">Over time, you run the risk of forgetting to add new tools. </st><st c="36309">Therefore, whatever method you use to implement new features, it might be a good idea to create an automatic sub-task to update the dependency matrix, too. </st><st c="36465">A big benefit is also to evaluate this matrix from time to time, which might identify potential</st><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/><st c="36560"> bottlenecks or problems you can </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="36593">work on.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="36601">Applications x platform – a reciprocal influence</st></h3>
			<p><st c="36650">The </st><strong class="bold"><st c="36655">reciprocal influence</st></strong><st c="36675"> is </st><a id="_idIndexMarker110"/><st c="36679">defined as related to each other in such a way that</st><a id="_idIndexMarker111"/><st c="36730"> one completes the other or is the equal of the other. </st><st c="36785">You have a certain kind of mutual influence in the relationship between the platform and your users’ applications. </st><st c="36900">For example, an application needs to scale drastically. </st><st c="36956">As a platform, you support this behavior but also guarantee that it doesn’t have an impact on other applications. </st><st c="37070">On the other hand, the application decided to go with your platform because you support its demand. </st><st c="37170">A platform without a user is useless. </st><st c="37208">To perform best as an application, you should run on </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="37261">that platform.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="37275">However, this example </st><a id="_idIndexMarker112"/><st c="37298">is very generic. </st><st c="37315">Reciprocal influence also affects elements outside the layers defined in YAML files. </st><st c="37400">It is also the demand and requirements it causes without asking for it; it is the team dynamics between both implementing parties; it is also the effect one solution has on others in the way </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="37591">they work.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="37601">Therefore, </st><em class="italic"><st c="37613">dependency</st></em><st c="37623"> would be the wrong word to describe this relationship. </st><st c="37679">It is a coexistence, a collaboration, pulling together in the same direction. </st><st c="37757">For a platform engineering team, and you as an architect especially, you have to keep this reciprocal influence in mind when you design your solution. </st><st c="37908">To make this your own superpower, you have to educate the platform engineers and users about these effects and focus on how they can get the best out of the platform without feeling </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="38090">any restrictions.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="38107">Reciprocal influence</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="38128">The reciprocal influence is the invisible play between the application and the platform. </st><st c="38218">Understand it as a joint force that makes the platform and the users’ application better together than they would be without </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="38343">each other.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="38354">Another place where such reciproca</st><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/><st c="38389">l influence becomes visible is </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="38421">in processes.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="38434">Opportunities of process definitions for a platform</st></h3>
			<p><st c="38486">Platform engineering</st><a id="_idIndexMarker113"/><st c="38507"> lends many approaches from the DevOps methodology. </st><st c="38559">In a DevOps role, some parts focus on automation. </st><st c="38609">Those automated steps translate into defining processes. </st><st c="38666">So, we also could say that platform engineers create technical processes for them to be implemented as a platform as a product to make it function in a user-oriented way. </st><st c="38837">However, those procedures are not very common in explicit design decisions. </st><st c="38913">The form of the process (or how the process looks like) depends on the way certain components work. </st><st c="39013">With respect to platform composability, this might be a given approach, but could we improve the platform by explicitly designing </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="39143">the processes?</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="39157">It shouldn’t be turned into a business process modeling. </st><st c="39215">Too many advanced features that are backed into tools such as GitOps or operators on Kubernetes can have multiple</st><a id="_idIndexMarker114"/><st c="39328"> variables based on decision paths. </st><st c="39364">It would be hilarious to draw all of those. </st><st c="39408">However, it is helpful for the process to be documented and designed to understand the platform. </st><st c="39505">The difficulty is in the multiple entry points processes, which can start at </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="39582">the following:</st></span></p>

			</ul>
			<p><st c="39681">Each requires its own </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="39704">process definition.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="39723">You have the opportunity to find optimization potentials with a focus on user-friendliness and handling. </st><st c="39829">Leveraging the process perspective differentiates user-centricity in your platform development from the more common, pure, tech-focused definition of features. </st><st c="39989">Unfortunately, we can’t give you more insight at this point in time as this discipline is still fresh, and there is barely any knowledge sharing happening around it. </st><st c="40155">In </st><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/><a href="B31164_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor133"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="40158">Chapter 3</st></em></span></a><st c="40167">, we will dig deeper into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="40193">this topic.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="40204">The vendor lock-in discussion</st></h3>
			<p><st c="40234">To conclude</st><a id="_idIndexMarker115"/><st c="40246"> the topic of dependencies, we have to touch on the discussion on vendor lock-in. </st><st c="40328">It is part of strategic and architectural decisions and often pushes for strange outcomes. </st><st c="40419">At this point, you should be fully aware that you will always have dependencies, and a vendor lock-in is nothing more than that. </st><st c="40548">As open source brings a fantastic foundation to avoid proprietary software, it is also used as an argument to build things by yourself. </st><st c="40684">The important question to ask is this: With which speed and service quality do you want to provide the platform to your users? </st><em class="italic"><st c="40811">What are your expected operational costs?</st></em><st c="40852"> In addition to that, you have to consider aspects</st><a id="_idIndexMarker116"/><st c="40902"> of the available team, skill sets, and which costs your</st><a id="_idIndexMarker117"/><st c="40958"> organization prefers (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="40981">operational expenses</st></strong><st c="41002"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="41004">OPEX</st></strong><st c="41008">) or </st><strong class="bold"><st c="41014">capitalized </st></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><st c="41026">expenses</st></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="41034"> (</st></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><st c="41036">CAPEX</st></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="41041">)).</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="41045">Some different perspectives on vendor lock-in are </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="41096">as follows:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="41107">Better build it yourself</st></strong><st c="41132">: Building certain capabilities entirely by yourself might feel like your ultimate freedom and avoid any kind of vendors. </st><st c="41255">The truth is you just become your own vendor. </st><st c="41301">At some point, you don’t want or can’t invest anymore in your development (common project behavior). </st><st c="41402">With that, you as your own vendor retire from your own market and everything that you were afraid of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="41503">becomes true.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="41516">Picking best in class per problem, not per context</st></strong><st c="41567">: In the range of observability, a large number of options exist for monitoring, logging, and tracing. </st><st c="41671">A </st><a id="_idIndexMarker118"/><st c="41673">common approach to this is to pick the open source tool that fits the best reach case. </st><st c="41760">Around this, you then have to implement a log collector and agents to forward metrics. </st><st c="41847">What you have achieved is a fully composable observability solution. </st><st c="41916">On the other hand, you are losing in comparison to a single vendor solution capabilities, such as context awareness, scalability, or operability. </st><st c="42062">I don’t want to say proprietary software is better; however, I have seen organizations that use 10-14 different tools, in different versions, running on the largest scale and having high operational costs far too often. </st><st c="42282">In fact, for a toolset, that practice isn’t considered helpful when it comes to incidents. </st><st c="42373">In this case, we unfortunately tend to avoid looking at the truth and finding excuses for why it is this </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="42478">way better.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="42489">Focusing on the wrong things</st></strong><st c="42518">: People still focus on the tasks of deploying Kubernetes. </st><st c="42578">It’s considered a challenge, and it becomes a never-ending story. </st><st c="42644">Consider utilizing tools, opinionated platforms, or commercial solutions to get your container orchestration done, and focus on the value-generating part of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="42801">your platform.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="42815">Vendor lock-in is an emotional discussion point on the agenda of an architect defining a target. </st><st c="42913">You have to keep your eyes and mind open and truly consider what is important and what is just there to feed the ego. </st><st c="43031">Complex and unmanageable solutions are nothing that will make one win awards </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="43108">for them.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="49550">Recapitulating </st><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/><st c="49566">the reference architectures, they provide a simple-to-understand concept of the platform. </st><st c="49656">What they don’t provide is the actual architecture of the platform. </st><st c="49724">Where is the source code versioning running? </st><st c="49769">Where are the CI/CD pipeline components? </st><st c="49810">Where is the container registry? </st><st c="49843">How is the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="49854">IDP hosted?</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="51269">Owning your architectures</st></h3>
			<p><st c="51295">It seems </st><a id="_idIndexMarker133"/><st c="51305">like a lot of paperwork to manage and handle different versions and variations of an architecture. </st><st c="51404">However, you might already have experienced that a platform changes faster than the diagrams. </st><st c="51498">The important thing is that neither the diagram, as a result of your work as an architect, slows down the development of the platform nor does the platform development slow down the diagrams. </st><st c="51690">I have seen projects where architects became an outstanding hierarchical institution. </st><st c="51776">All of those projects failed and had difficulties in doing the right thing. </st><st c="51852">As an architect, you are not all-knowing, but you are also not the platform engineering team. </st><st c="51946">Working together, aligned, and in sync is the key, almost like the platform you want </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="52031">to build.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="52040">The same thing counts for your architectures. </st><st c="52087">You have to own them but not rule them. </st><st c="52127">An architecture must be a playground for ideas, a communicator for future developments, and a source of truth regarding the capabilities of the platform. </st><st c="52281">That’s just </st><a id="_idIndexMarker134"/><st c="52293">possible if you are responsible for driving it with the input </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="52355">of others.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="52365">Later in this book, we will cover a relevant topic when we talk a</st><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/><st c="52431">bout owning your architecture: dealing with </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="52476">technical debts.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/><st c="52492">Opinionated platforms and the cost of quality</st></h2>
			<p><st c="52538">While</st><a id="_idIndexMarker135"/><st c="52544"> architecting a platform, two issues will arise: opinionated tools and the cost of quality. </st><st c="52636">Both have very good arguments to</st><a id="_idIndexMarker136"/><st c="52668"> be cons</st><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/><st c="52676">idered, but they also have very strong arguments </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="52726">against them.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="52739">Opinionated tools and products</st></h3>
			<p><st c="52770">Opinionated</st><a id="_idIndexMarker137"/><st c="52782"> tools, products, and services emphasize a strict concept and don’t provide alternatives. </st><st c="52872">Practically everything comes with an opinion, but the question is how flexible and composable they are. </st><st c="52976">A strong opinion on how something should be done makes the following decisions easier as the solution space shrinks. </st><st c="53093">With a growing user base on such an approach, it might become dominant and eventually a de facto standard. </st><st c="53200">We have to carefully consider them in our architecture and clarify an understanding of their potential </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="53303">future impact.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="53317">Now, the strict implementation of a concept can come with many benefits. </st><st c="53391">For example, every solution is opinionated in the space of provisioning Kubernetes clusters. </st><st c="53484">However, they provide a holistic solution that is consistent and usually ready for production. </st><st c="53579">Such tools can also be faster in integration when they cover a large field of topics and pre-integrate other tools. </st><st c="53695">This can also be, on the other hand, a downside, as if you like to implement other options, it will cause more effort to do so. </st><st c="53823">Yet, even in some cases, it is almost impossible or way </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="53879">too expensive.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="53893">You should also differentiate between the visible and big concepts and the more invisible, hidden ones. </st><st c="53998">The first ones are easy to identify and evaluate. </st><st c="54048">They come with a large</st><a id="_idIndexMarker138"/><st c="54070"> stack of pre-defined integrations and are usually based on a single vendor’s technology. </st><st c="54160">The small and hidden opinionated tools are more difficult, </st><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/><st c="54219">as they reveal their downside the more extensively you </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="54274">use them.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="54283">The cost of quality</st></h3>
			<p><st c="54303">There is </st><a id="_idIndexMarker139"/><st c="54313">this saying: </st><em class="italic"><st c="54326">Better to buy expensive once than cheap often</st></em><st c="54371">. With platforms done right, this saying is wrong. </st><st c="54422">Following a product mindset means a continuous investment. </st><st c="54481">It is more like a garden you have to take care of day by day rather than a watch where you have a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="54579">one-time investment.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="54599">The cost of quality is a multi-dimensional problem. </st><st c="54652">A high-quality platform, most likely very opinionated, might be, for some use cases, the perfect fit. </st><st c="54754">But the quality doesn’t come for free and is based on high investments or operational fees. </st><st c="54846">Within larger companies, you have something like internal cost sharing. </st><st c="54918">That also means that you have to share the costs of quality. </st><st c="54979">We frequently see in the end-user community that such platforms lead to frustration. </st><st c="55064">The entry level due to costs is then too high for hosting simple applications, or too opinionated to run a very complex application system on it. </st><st c="55210">This causes others to start building from scratch their own platform and solutions for their application. </st><st c="55316">As you can see, this is a strange problem. </st><st c="55359">Due to the high costs of the platform, the operational costs for a user become high too, while the opinionated solution doesn’t actually give what one needs. </st><st c="55517">That is called the </st><strong class="bold"><st c="55536">cost </st></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><st c="55541">of quality</st></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="55551">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="55552">However, you also can’t go around this issue by plugging and playing some random tools fast together to provide a cheap and as open as possible platform too. </st><st c="55711">This might lead to an initial fast ramp-up of projects to adopt the platform, but I can promise this way, the faster they come to you, the faster they will leave your solution. </st><st c="55888">Remember, with a product mindset, you want to enable your users to do things by themself, while your platform takes away all heavy lifts. </st><st c="56026">Ideally, your user also doesn’t need to become an expert in all the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56094">technologies used.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="56112">On a strategic level, the problem of the cost of quality affects many decisions. </st><st c="56194">We have seen platforms that went through years of development only to be challenged in the end by their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56298">performance/price ratio.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="56322">You will need to find the golden path for your platform. </st><st c="56380">However, don’t assume that a perfect platform matches what others need. </st><st c="56452">If you phase this issue, it is a clear sign that </st><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/><st c="56501">you have lost track of a product mindset with a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56549">user orientation.</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="57550">Creating your reference architecture</st></h3>
			<p><st c="57587">The reference architecture</st><a id="_idIndexMarker141"/><st c="57614"> outlines your planned components, categorizes them, and anchors them at the forefront of your platform implementation. </st><st c="57734">This is also your source of help in defining the dependencies map at </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="57803">some point.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="57814">To fill your reference architecture diagram with some life, it is good practice to either start with the already fixed components or the given infrastructure. </st><st c="57974">Fixed components can be, for example, CI/CD tools or security solutions. </st><st c="58047">To start, the infrastructure becomes relevant as it influences the resources provided. </st><st c="58134">If you go on with a public cloud provider, many services can be used as a managed solution. </st><st c="58226">In some cases, this also defines</st><a id="_idIndexMarker142"/><st c="58258"> which </st><strong class="bold"><st c="58265">Infrastructure as Code</st></strong><st c="58287"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="58289">IaC</st></strong><st c="58292">) you are going to use, or the other way around, if you take just an infrastructure-as-a-service provider, it means you have to think about potential services that are running somewhere </st><a id="_idIndexMarker143"/><st c="58479">else in the platform. </st><st c="58501">Most likely, they will end up in the capability plane, which then causes this question: Do we need a dedicated cluster for shared services or do we implement an approach that the service will be deployed on site of the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="58720">users’ namespace?</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="58737">Next, take on the automation and orchestration plane. </st><st c="58792">For some reason, this plane is relatively pre-decided and provides a solid ground for decisions for the developer experience plane. </st><st c="58924">You should be sure that the given solutions are on a newer release and can integrate with other cloud-native services without </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="59050">any scripting.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="59064">Last but not least, you have to come up with the observability and the security plane. </st><st c="59152">As said, it can be that you have already defined solutions in place. </st><st c="59221">But especially for organizations where this platform engineering and cloud-native journey is new, you might challenge the given solutions. </st><st c="59360">Security tools need to be able to understand the cloud and Kubernetes. </st><st c="59431">They need to be integrated into those platforms and be able to handle their very dynamic nature. </st><st c="59528">The same reason counts for observability and operational solutions. </st><st c="59596">You don’t want to get an alert every time pods get killed or moved around in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="59673">the cluster.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="59685">Most importantly, you bring all the perspectives together in the end: the platform principles and purpose, its key users, composability, and the reciprocal influence between all of those moving components. </st><st c="59892">But your design doesn’t need to be perfect. </st><st c="59936">Before you go too deep into the design pro</st><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/><st c="59978">cess, read on, as we cover the topic of the TVP later in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="60036">this chapter.</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="62099">Defining the infrastructure architecture for the platform</st></h3>
			<p><st c="62157">After the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker148"/><st c="62167"> fun part of defining the reference architecture, we have to go straight into the serious architecture definition. </st><st c="62282">What sounds like a joke is fairly often skipped, yet many platforms can’t provide this view. </st><st c="62375">In fact, this diagram is more relevant than the reference architecture for the implementation, architectural discussion, and security and compliance checks. </st><st c="62532">However, it is also more complicated </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="62569">to understand.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="62583">As explained previously, we have to combine on one side an infrastructure architecture with the respective components of the platform. </st><st c="62719">This helps us understand where everything in our system’s landscape is located and which connections </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="62820">are required.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="62833">The diagram has to highlight the different environments in which computing infrastructure is used, which managed services are consumed, how those are connected to each other, and which external connections exist. </st><st c="63047">Every organization has its own way of drawing such diagrams, following given standards, or being more simplified. </st><st c="63161">Our template tries to give a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="63190">middle ground.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="63204">You might also vary with the highlights on the architectural diagram. </st><st c="63275">We often see huge relevance in visualizing the exact network connection, network isolation, or protocols. </st><st c="63381">The combination of an isolated environment with a corresponding control flow and how updates are played into it will utilize both types of diagrams to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="63532">maximize understanding.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="63555">Remember to include things like management environments/clusters, staging environments for integration testing, or even one step before the development environment in the diagram. </st><st c="63736">For continuity purposes, backup and recovery might be helpful too. </st><st c="63803">You</st><a id="_idIndexMarker149"/><st c="63806"> see, the more you work on it, the more details will float into it. </st><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/><st c="63874">When a diagram becomes too complex, you should provide </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="63929">different versions.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="63948">Visualizing the control flow of the platform</st></h3>
			<p><st c="63993">What </st><a id="_idIndexMarker150"/><st c="63999">might be new to you is the </st><strong class="bold"><st c="64026">control flow</st></strong><st c="64038">. It is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker151"/><st c="64045"> the first good step of a process-like approach to get clearance on certain relevant paths to manage the platform and user deliverables. </st><st c="64182">There are multiple flows within a platform; these three are the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="64246">most prominent:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="64261">Infrastructure provisioning</st></strong><st c="64289">: This flow visualizes the importance of the infrastructure test environments and how changes on that level can impact them, from committing the IaC manifest in a versioning system through deployment, testing, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="64504">final rollout.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="64518">Code to deployment</st></strong><st c="64537">: This is most relevant for the platform users. </st><st c="64586">How does one’s committed code get picked up to be built, integrated, scanned, and tested? </st><st c="64676">What does the development and life-setting procedure </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="64729">look like?</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="64739">Platform capability management</st></strong><st c="64770">: Especially relevant for the platform engineers taking care of the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="64839">cluster-delivered components.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="64868">There are many other smaller control flows that can help us understand the platform, such as secrets and certificate management or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="65000">user management.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="65016">Moving on from the paperwork to real use cases, we will have a look at some examples of different platform flavors and implementations. </st><st c="65153">In the next part, you will </st><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/><st c="65180">extend your perspective from generalistic platforms to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="65235">specialized solutions.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="67657">In </st><a href="B31164_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor133"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="67661">Chapter 3</st></em></span></a><st c="67670">, in the </st><em class="italic"><st c="67679">Understanding the existing SDLC</st></em><st c="67710"> section, we will have a closer look at how to best understand the current SDLC or the </st><em class="italic"><st c="67797">Value Creation Journey</st></em><st c="67819"> within an organization. </st><st c="67844">You will learn about different approaches to understanding the life cycle of an artifact, the tasks involved, the dependencies, and how to track time to identify good candidates for automating those as part of a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="68056">platform offering.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="68074">Let us now explore some of those use c</st><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/><st c="68113">ases and implementation options from organizations we have worked with in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="68188">the past!</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/><st c="68197">Centralizing expertise as a self-service use case</st></h2>
			<p><st c="68247">While </st><a id="_idIndexMarker158"/><st c="68254">there are many more of those use cases, here are a couple of examples that you will l</st><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/><st c="68339">ikely find yourself implementing as a self-service feature as part of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="68410">your platform.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="68424">Provisioning compliant environments</st></h3>
			<p><st c="68460">Depending</st><a id="_idIndexMarker159"/><st c="68470"> on the industry, there are certain regulations on how data has to be stored, how environments have to be secured, and what type of reporting needs to happen. </st><st c="68629">To make sure that every environment that is requested by any team in an organization is compliant with all those rules, we can implement this as a self-service capability of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="68803">our platform.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="68816">Here is a user story for that use case: “</st><em class="italic"><st c="68858">As a data scientist, I want to validate my new data models against a </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="68928">production-like dataset!</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="68952">”</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="68954">There are </st><a id="_idIndexMarker160"/><st c="68964">several details that have to be worked out in order to break this story into its individual tasks, such as the following: Where do these data sets come from? </st><st c="69122">Does the data scientist want to choose one from multiple available ones? </st><st c="69195">What’s the output of the validation, where is it stored, and who has access to it? </st><st c="69278">How do you select the data model? </st><st c="69312">How long does this validation run and do we need a max time to shut down the environment to avoid unnecessary costs? </st><st c="69429">What type of auditing data do we need to produce as this is about accessing </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="69505">production data?</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="69521">Another similar user story could be this: “</st><em class="italic"><st c="69565">As a QA engineer, I want to run my manual tests against the latest version of our software connected to a production database, using a browser/OS combination that matches what 80% of our end </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="69757">users use!</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="69767">”</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="69769">Similar to the previous user story, we need to ask some additional questions, such as the following: What is the software product you want to test and how can it automatically be deployed? </st><st c="69958">Where can we find the data about the browser/OS usage of our production users? </st><st c="70037">How long does this environment need to be available? </st><st c="70090">Can we set an expiration time for that provisioned environment? </st><st c="70154">What data is the engineer allowed to see and which data are they not allowed to see, as we are dealing with having access to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="70279">production data?</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="70295">The implementation of such a use case can vary widely but we should always start and think about the </st><em class="italic"><st c="70397">end user journey</st></em><st c="70413">. We probably want our data scientist or quality engineer to log on to our internal development platform portal. </st><st c="70526">There, they can select the use case of </st><em class="italic"><st c="70565">provisioning a compliant environment</st></em><st c="70601">. Then, they can fill out the relevant data to answer all those questions that came up. </st><st c="70689">That input can then b</st><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/><st c="70710">e used to create that environment and make it available to the team that </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="70784">requested it.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="70797">Running performance and resiliency tests</st></h3>
			<p><st c="70838">Performance and resiliency testing should </st><a id="_idIndexMarker161"/><st c="70881">be part of every release of software to ensure that new features do not impact the UX by becoming super slow. </st><st c="70991">We also want to make sure that our new software is resilient against unforeseen scenarios, such as a network connectivity issue, a slow or unavailable backend service or data, or an unexpectedly </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="71186">high load.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="71196">While there</st><a id="_idIndexMarker162"/><st c="71208"> are many tools that can generate traffic (load testing tools) or simulate problems (chaos engineering), those tools and the environments they need often take a lot of expertise to set up, configure, run, and later analyze </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="71431">the results.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="71443">Instead of having our performance, site reliability, or chaos engineers become the bottleneck, we can strive to centralize that expertise and provide this as a self-service to our engineering teams. </st><st c="71643">Here would be the right user story: “</st><em class="italic"><st c="71680">As a development team, we want to know whether the latest version of our software has any performance or </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="71786">resiliency degradations!</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="71810">”</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="71812">There could be multiple iterations of this self-service capability that we could implement. </st><st c="71904">Starting with provisioning the environment that contains the relevant tools, all the developers need to do is execute the tests and wait for the results. </st><st c="72058">Ideally, though, we want to end up in a situation where this can be fully automated and even integrated into our development process. </st><st c="72192">We should aim for something like this: “</st><em class="italic"><st c="72232">As a development team, we want to get a performance and resiliency indicator on major Pull Requests so we know whether the latest code change is good enough to be promoted </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="72405">to production!</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="72419">”</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="72421">Like in the previous example, we could start with a portal where teams can request the performance testing environment. </st><st c="72541">To fulfill the second, fully automated user story, we need to think about providing an API that can be called from the CI/CD pipeline system that get</st><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/><st c="72690">s all relevant input parameters and then returns the actual result of the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="72765">executed test.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="72779">Onboarding of a new application</st></h3>
			<p><st c="72811">Creating</st><a id="_idIndexMarker163"/><st c="72820"> new applications or services is what development teams do. </st><st c="72880">To do so, they typically have to go through a lot of different steps, such as creating a new Git repository, adding boilerplate code and metadata settings, configuring the build (CI) pipelines, and many </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="73083">more steps.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="73094">If every development team always started from scratch, we would not only end up with multiple different ways of doing essentially the same thing, but we would also have a lot of duplicated work across all development teams that take the time away from </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="73347">actual coding.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="73361">A good user story for a platform self-service feature would be this: “</st><em class="italic"><st c="73432">As a development team, we want to create a new application based on a fully configured template so that we can focus on writing code and not deal with how we build, deploy, </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="73606">and operate!</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="73618">”</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="73620">Looking </st><a id="_idIndexMarker164"/><st c="73628">at the full SDLC, our self-service can even start a step earlier, with the feature requirement that was created by the product</st><a id="_idIndexMarker165"/><st c="73754"> team with tools such as </st><strong class="bold"><st c="73779">Jira</st></strong><st c="73783">.

			<p class="author-quote"><st c="86295">Do good things and talk about it. </st><st c="86330">(Georg Volkmar Earl of Zedtwitz-Arnim, 1978.)</st></p>
			<p><st c="86375">A common issue</st><a id="_idIndexMarker182"/><st c="86390"> we see across many platform implementations is the lack of evidence of its benefits. </st><st c="86476">In theory, that all makes sense, but let’s put some numbers behind it. </st><st c="86547">In addition, they help to understand if you are going in the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="86608">right direction.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="86624">Therefore, it is helpful to define different </st><strong class="bold"><st c="86670">KPIs</st></strong><st c="86674"> based on which one can understand the progress of platform adoption. </st><st c="86744">In the first step, you should reflect on what you measure already. </st><st c="86811">Very often, we just need to combine available numbers in the right way to be able to define new </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="86907">performance indicators.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="86930">First, we need to understand the metrics, logs, and traces, define how we get the values they represent, and what they mean. </st><st c="87056">While all of them can be relevant sources, most will not be relevant to your platform’s adoption. </st><st c="87154">This just represents the system’s side. </st><st c="87194">Meanwhile, it should be clear that we are more interested in the user and their</st><a id="_idIndexMarker183"/><st c="87273"> experience. </st><st c="87286">Support channels, ticket systems, open pull requests, the number of onboarding requests, and other user interactive tools will be helpful in understanding the adaptation. </st><st c="87457">The importance of those numbers will change over time. </st><st c="87512">For example, the number of people requesting access to the platform will usually look like a hill with two flat sides. </st><st c="87631">On the one side, because people are too shy to try new things, adoption starts slow. </st><st c="87716">On the other side of the hill, fewer new projects will be onboarded to the platform. </st><st c="87801">Another example could be the number of support requests. </st><st c="87858">They usually grow with the number of users. </st><st c="87902">However, as a platform targets self-service, those numbers can be expected to decrease to a minimum over time while your platform becomes better and users understand how to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="88075">use it.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="88082">That’s why, secondly, you have to define the current context of your platform’s KPI. </st><st c="88168">It might seem to be obvious that a mature platform might have different KPIs or that your stakeholders have to read those KPIs differently but believe me, it is not. </st><st c="88334">It is on you to make this transparent, clear, and understandable </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="88399">to everyone.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="89710">With the first adoption support requests, costs per change are increasing, while only a few applications are being migrated. </st><st c="89836">During the ramp-up phase, you can see that the number of new applications is increasing fast, and at the same time, the support requests go up. </st><st c="89980">The cost per change stagnates. </st><st c="90011">In the next segment of optimization, we can now see heavy changes. </st><st c="90078">Cost per change and support requests are dropping steeply. </st><st c="90137">The number of new applications is at its peak and slowly going down due to the fact that most applications that could use a platform </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="90270">have migrated.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="90284">Over the three phases, the time per release drops down. </st><st c="90341">That’s an effect of the automation and self-service and starts flattening out in the last segment. </st><st c="90440">This is similar to almost all other KPIs that have found a steady development. </st><st c="90519">In comparison to the other diagrams, we also changed the representation of the number of added applications. </st><st c="90628">Now, you can see the number of migrated apps per quarter as well as the overall number </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="90715">of applications.</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="91944">DORA metrics</st></h3>
			<p><strong class="bold"><st c="91957">DevOps Research and Assessment</st></strong><st c="91988"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="91990">DORA</st></strong><st c="91994">) is a start-up created by Gene Kim and Jez Humble, whom</st><a id="_idIndexMarker186"/><st c="92051"> you might know from </st><em class="italic"><st c="92072">The DevOps Handbook</st></em><st c="92091">. The DORA metrics are a set of four KPIs that can be used to measure the performance of a DevOps team and the impact of a platform </st><a id="_idIndexMarker187"/><st c="92223">on its users. </st><st c="92237">Although they do not always fit well, they are widely adopted and used, for example, by systems such as </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="92341">GitLab </st></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="92348">[13]</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="92352">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="92353">The DORA metrics are </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="92375">as follows:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="92386">Deployment frequency</st></strong><st c="92407">: How often an organization successfully releases </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="92458">to production</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="92471">Lead time for changes</st></strong><st c="92493">: The amount of time it takes a commitment to get </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="92544">into production</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="92559">Time to restore services</st></strong><st c="92584">: The percentage of deployments causing a failure </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="92635">in production</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="92648">Change failure rate</st></strong><st c="92668">: How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="92731">in production</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="92744">I often saw that organizations change the term from </st><em class="italic"><st c="92797">production</st></em><st c="92807"> to </st><em class="italic"><st c="92811">release</st></em><st c="92818"> or </st><em class="italic"><st c="92822">productive release</st></em><st c="92840">. That’s because most companies have multiple stages a release goes through before it goes live in front of an end user. </st><st c="92961">Due to every organization’s specifics, there are multiple solutions to measure those numbers, but in the end, it’s common to implement your own approach </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="93114">for it.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="93121">To measure the number of releases, you can run a simple API call against your favorite source code versioning system that supports you with your releases. </st><st c="93277">These numbers can be dumped into a database and be visualized by a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="93344">Grafana dashboard.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="93362">It is more complicated to identify the lead time. </st><st c="93413">For this, you have to track commits and when they end up in a release. </st><st c="93484">However, both metrics are simple to get and calculate. </st><st c="93539">The change failure rate, on the other hand, becomes more problematic. </st><st c="93609">For this, it is required that you include information about your releases throughout the whole deployment and production chain so that if a failure occurs, you can identify in the logs to which release this issue belongs. </st><st c="93831">In addition, you then also have to qualify if it is really an issue caused by the release </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="93921">or not.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="93928">The time to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker188"/><st c="93941">restore service follows the same procedure. </st><st c="93985">You need to identify when an incident occurs when it was closed successfully, and when it was resolved by a restore. </st><st c="94102">Your incident management system can provide both of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="94154">those metrics.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="94168">Now, what’s so </st><a id="_idIndexMarker189"/><st c="94184">special about the DORA metrics is that they have researched thousands of companies to give an overview of how good or bad you are compared to others. </st><st c="94334">From their last report in 2023, we can find the following categories and share of companies falling into those </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="94445">categories </st></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="94456">[14]</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="94460">.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="103681">However, there is a way that’s not abstract and unclear, like a story point, and it is a bulletproof approach to talking with users and stakeholders about the platform and its efficiency: costs. </st><st c="103877">I know this is not an innovative KPI, yet it is often done incorrectly by many teams and is feared by product owners. </st><st c="103995">What I also don’t mean by it is to report the team’s costs, infrastructure, or licenses. </st><st c="104084">You can use the cost metrics as proof of the performance of your platform and t</st><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/><st c="104163">he </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="104167">platform team.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="104181">Cost per change</st></h3>
			<p><strong class="bold"><st c="104197">Cost per change</st></strong><st c="104213"> is an </st><a id="_idIndexMarker213"/><st c="104220">efficient way to highlight a platform’s improvement and power. </st><st c="104283">Within the end-user community of the cloud-native ecosystem, we see examples of this KPI used to discuss how well a platform </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="104408">is running.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="104419">Let’s compare two different values for the cost </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="104468">per change:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="104479">$500 per change</st></strong><st c="104495">: $15,000 per month or $180,000 per year by 30 </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="104543">changes monthly</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="104558">$80 per change</st></strong><st c="104573">: $2,400 per month or $28,800 per year by 30 </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="104619">changes monthly</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="104634">Now, obviously, there is a drastic difference between both numbers. </st><st c="104703">But you should consider that you will always start with higher costs and very few changes. </st><st c="104794">Ideally, the platform team and the platform become better over time to stabilize overall costs, but the number of changes increases. </st><st c="104927">This leads to lower costs per change. </st><st c="104965">The following chart represents this in order to visualize it better. </st><st c="105034">The dotted line shows an example of the overall costs. </st><st c="105089">They increase slightly over time as the platform becomes more effective. </st><st c="105162">The dark line shows the changes per year, and the dashed line is the cost per change. </st><st c="105248">As you can see, the cost per change drops drastically the more changes you are able to make. </st><st c="105341">It is a very basic number, but a strong communication tool for your platform and its platform </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="105435">engineering team.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="105677">Related</st><a id="_idIndexMarker214"/><st c="105685"> to cost per change is cost per project, product, or application. </st><st c="105751">We can look at these costs from two </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="105787">different directions:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="105808">Total shared costs</st></strong><st c="105827">: Looking only at aspects such as team costs, additional efforts, or costs that are </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="105912">not causation-based</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="105931">Balanced causation-based costs</st></strong><st c="105962">: The causation-based costs include, besides the shared costs, the real costs of infrastructure and services consumed by </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="106084">a project</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="106093">To highlight the performance of the platform and the team, I would recommend going with the total shared costs. </st><st c="106206">Such numbers are simple to get and split between the projects so that you can track them on a monthly basis without too much effort. </st><st c="106339">An alternative to that is the </st><em class="italic"><st c="106369">introduction costs per project</st></em><st c="106399">. For this metric, you need to calculate the effort that goes into the onboarding for each project using the platform. </st><st c="106518">However, I personally wouldn’t spend the effort on these metrics. </st><st c="106584">They are more rhetorical numbers and don’t provide insights into your platform performance, but more about how efficient you are </st><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/><st c="106713">in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="106716">the onboarding.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="106731">User/product overhead costs</st></h3>
			<p><st c="106759">The </st><a id="_idIndexMarker215"/><st c="106764">overhead costs perspective is very similar to the cost per change. </st><st c="106831">Here, you sum up all direct and shared costs and reduce them by only the consumed resources. </st><st c="106924">So, it is important to differentiate between tools such as agents, network traffic, and maybe personal user-related costs from the actual resources used by the product. </st><st c="107093">Calculating this is complicated, but the result is a performance metric of your platform’s and platform team’s </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="107204">overhead costs.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="107219">It’s a metric that splits the minds. </st><st c="107257">On the one hand, it should be as small as possible to be able to sell the platform internally. </st><st c="107352">On the other hand, that number represents the costs of the actual value of the platform. </st><st c="107441">So, I believe we would need to hide the middle ground that is not too costly but als</st><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/><st c="107525">o not </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="107532">too expensive.</st></span></p>
