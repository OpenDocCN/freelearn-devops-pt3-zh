    has on what organizations strive to achieve. In the previous chapter, we saw how
    culture (people, their behavior, and the structures that encourage their behavior
    in organizations) provides the underpinnings of processes and tools. So, if culture
    is so important, what’s the best culture and how do we attain that if we find
    that our present culture is lacking?

    comes easily. The organization’s goals are transparent and visible to all. Actions
    by other members within the organization and outside of the organization are communicated
    so that dependencies between efforts are effectively managed. So, this awareness
    is not only local to the organization but also exhibits a broader point of view.
