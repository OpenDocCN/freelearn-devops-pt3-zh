    and user-friendly apps is not just about coding, testing, and releasing the app.
    Mobile DevOps teams need to manage a complex set of activities, as we discussed
    in the previous chapters, including **Continuous Integration and Delivery** (**CI/CD**),
    release orchestration, monitoring, and analytics. Investing in DX can help Mobile
    DevOps teams to streamline and automate these activities, leading to improved
    app quality, faster **time-to-market** (**TTM**), and better team productivity.
