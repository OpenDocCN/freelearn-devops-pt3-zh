    set of practices continuously and repeatedly as a part of every release iteration.
    However, high-performance teams approach everything with a learning mindset and
    identify improvements along the way to establish better discipline and becomes
    masters in doing things, such as effective **continuous integration** (**CI**)/**continuous
    deployment** (**CD**) practices for release agility, monitoring deployments to
    reduce failures, and addressing production issues in a timely manner.

    manufacturing industry. It refers to the technique of creating a lean process,
    having very minimal steps to produce a product for the customer. This is an important
    approach to improve any business workflow or process, thereby eliminating waste
    and redundant steps that don’t add any value, especially when viewed from a customer’s
    perspective.'

    the number of handoffs required between different team members, thereby improving
    the overall efficiency and productivity. With greater emphasis on digital transformation
    journeys, organizations are reinventing their business strategy, with a rapid
    realignment of any existing business/IT processes. The overall goal is to realign,
    if necessary, the definition of *delivered value* for customers.

- en: In the context of a DevOps life cycle, it may be considered as identifying a
    lean methodology, comprising only the steps that are necessary to produce value
    for the customer. The DevOps value stream serves as an optimization driver, thereby
    impacting people, processes, and products. The primary motivation is to minimize
    wastage while continuously delivering customer value.

    in a timely fashion to take corrective actions. Hence, we must rely on any existing
    automation available or explore additional opportunities to improve data capture
    and notification processes. Most of the DevOps tools today have rich automation
    capabilities, making it easier for decision making.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the quality of the changes and can immediately send out an email to a developer
    if there were any automated test run failures. Thus, the developer can fix the
    issue and resubmit their changes, instead of waiting for hours for the full results
    to become available.

    DevOps processes is important for any organization. There are typically two focus

    for the leadership team.'
