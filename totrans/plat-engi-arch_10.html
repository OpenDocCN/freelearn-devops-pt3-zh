			<p><st c="1900">The major challenge of ongoing change is that </st><a id="_idIndexMarker978"/><st c="1947">as a platform team, you need to adopt and embody a forward-thinking mindset yourself, while also guiding and inspiring your users to adopt the same approach. </st><st c="2105">If you can’t provide this, in the best-case scenario, your users will request and force your solution and team to adapt. </st><st c="2226">In the worst-case scenario, they will abandon your platform and will look for other solutions. </st><st c="2321">So, it is down to you to provide a solid but flexible foundation for change </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2397">and growt</st><a id="_idTextAnchor511"/><st c="2406">h.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor512"/><st c="2409">The imperative of change</st></h2>
			<p><st c="2434">We previously discussed how fast technology </st><a id="_idIndexMarker979"/><st c="2479">evolves, as well as how major technology milestone cycles happen every 10–15 years. </st><st c="2563">As Kubernetes has just turned 10, we can expect a revolution in the next few years. </st><st c="2647">However, smaller changes also create the necessity for platforms to adapt to new requirements and innovations. </st><st c="2758">Platform architects have to find a way to balance the stability of a platform and the innovation given by the market. </st><st c="2876">This tension between those two elements can be overwhelming. </st><st c="2937">It will question the concepts of your platform, the decisions of your IT organization, and the design choices of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3050">your users.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="3061">The MIT Sloan School of Management has defined this underlying structure of continuous change. </st><st c="3157">They found out that what often looks like chaotic changes is just a continuation of the four cycles shown in the following figure. </st><st c="3288">It took them 15 years of research to understand that these changes do not happen linearly but start over and over again. </st><st c="3409">Where do we start in this cycle? </st><st c="3442">It depends because we are already in it, and actually, every technology, methodology, or framework has its own cycle, slightly influencing other cycles. </st><st c="3595">Let’s take platform engineering as a concept. </st><st c="3641">Where it really started is difficult to say; did it evolve from DevOps? </st><st c="3713">Did the term come up with tools such as Backstage? </st><st c="3764">Was someone thinking philosophically about the IT world and thought that it was a good idea? </st><st c="3857">Most likely, it was a little bit of everything that started the self-propelling force of platform engineering. </st><st c="3968">It led to new tools and architectural perspectives. </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4020">DevRel</st></strong><st c="4026"> (short for </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4038">Developer Relations</st></strong><st c="4057">) professionals</st><a id="_idIndexMarker980"/><st c="4073"> discussed it with others, demonstrating how it works, which eventually led to us writing a book </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4170">about it.</st></span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor514"/><st c="4623">Fostering a culture of change</st></h2>
			<p><st c="4653">What do we take from the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker982"/><st c="4678"> imperative of change? </st><st c="4701">We cannot avoid change; if you do so, you avoid your own and your platform’s future. </st><st c="4786">As a platform team, you are in an ideal position to foster a culture of change. </st><st c="4866">Yes, yet another topic to put on your plate, which has nothing to do with engineering, but that makes the role of platform engineers so special. </st><st c="5011">You are in an ideal place because the platform and your work are the connections between your IT landscape, the development teams, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5146">the business.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="5159">Taking this responsibility and becoming a thought leader isn’t an easy task. </st><st c="5237">To add the role of platform engineers who set a vision for the future and lead teams through change requires strategies to build a team culture that embraces change, including communication, incentives, and leadership support. </st><st c="5464">The right cultural approach depends on your team and the individuals in your organization, something that barely can be covered in a book. </st><st c="5603">What we can recommend is to create environments that invite users for experimentation, such as sandbox environments or pilot projects. </st><st c="5738">But you have to do more; you need to create such environments for your own team too, and you need to encourage your platform engineers to test new technologies. </st><st c="5899">Your results must be documented and available for the whole team so that you avoid duplicating work, as well as so that you can compare the maturity of tested technologies </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6071">over time.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6081">Therefore, you have to implement a routine to celebrate success and failure in the same way. </st><st c="6175">In practical science, failure is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker983"/><st c="6207"> an important part of research. </st><st c="6239">Companies such as SpaceX blow up rocket after rocket, but they still count it as a success because, every time, they come closer to their target. </st><st c="6385">Maybe don’t blow up your data center, but at least allow a safe environment where you can invest money for failure. </st><st c="6501">Organizations waste money all day long for seemingly nonsense activities. </st><st c="6575">If you can do something that makes your team and your technological readiness grow, it is way better to </st><a id="_idTextAnchor515"/><span class="No-Break"><st c="6679">do so.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor516"/><st c="6685">Iterative evolution and an evolving strategy</st></h2>
			<p><st c="6730">With a safe environment for testing new technologies, you will be able to identify which ones to introduce to your platform </st><a id="_idIndexMarker984"/><st c="6855">and maybe even replace an old one. </st><st c="6890">Finding </st><a id="_idIndexMarker985"/><st c="6898">the balance between stability and innovation can vary from case to case. </st><st c="6971">We have seen platforms that always release, in a big bang, a completely new environment and become very professional in automatically migrating the workload to the new platform. </st><st c="7149">However, many decide to take the approach of introducing new technologies and features step by step. </st><st c="7250">Utilizing feature toggles and giving access in a canary deployment style to a user allow you to slowly but safely introduce changes. </st><st c="7383">With good observability and feedback loops, you will also get the chance to raise the quality of the new features and let the user be part of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7525">the evolution.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7539">Evolution doesn’t need to happen with big milestones; it is also important to continuously do </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7634">the following:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="7648">Refactor code and improve the quality </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7687">of it</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="7692">Take feature requests </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7715">into consideration</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="7733">Reflect on technical debts and see whether they have since </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7793">become solvable</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="7808">Update third party </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7828">integrations frequently</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="7851">In this context, it is also important to think about how to deprecate implementations. </st><st c="7939">Some tools might have experienced a lot of hype but died soon after being implemented, due to a missing sustainable contribution and development. </st><st c="8085">Others might be replaced over time with new major versions. </st><st c="8145">Setting up a depreciation strategy is, therefore, also a part of the evolution of your platform. </st><st c="8242">It requires clear communication of the impact and timelines to</st><a id="_idIndexMarker986"/><st c="8304"> the user. </st><st c="8315">With deprecation, you will also identify how modular and loosely </st><a id="_idIndexMarker987"/><st c="8380">coupled the components of your platform really are and whether users have built up some kind </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8473">of dependencies.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8489">Adopting new technologies is a journey and a mindset. </st><st c="8544">As platform engineers, you are in the right place to do so. </st><st c="8604">Establish a continuous learning environment, frequent feedback loops, and post-mortem reviews to learn quickly and speed up </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8728">successful evolution.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8749">In the next section, we will shortly highlight a recent trend in sustainable development. </st><st c="8840">We will focus on environmental </st><a id="_idIndexMarker988"/><st c="8871">sustainability, which has become a strong driver within the last years, and the sudden growth of </st><strong class="bold"><st c="8968">Generative Artificial Intelligence</st></strong><st c="9002"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="9004">GenAI</st></strong><st c="9009">) has put the topic under the spotlight ever more. </st><st c="9061">So, here are a few things we can do as platform engineers to deliver our part for a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9145">sustaina</st><a id="_idTextAnchor517"/><st c="9153">ble future.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor518"/><st c="9165">Considering sustainable and lightweight architectures and approaches</st></h1>
			<p><st c="9234">IT has become one of the global top </st><strong class="bold"><st c="9271">Carbon Dioxide</st></strong><st c="9285"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="9287">CO2</st></strong><st c="9290">) originators, alongside the construction and aviation industry. </st><st c="9356">The </st><a id="_idIndexMarker989"/><st c="9360">best studies on it are, unfortunately, several years old, but we can summarize the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9443">2018 findings:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="9457">The global IT consumed around 2% </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9491">of electricity</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="9505">This caused between 1.5%–2.4% of the global CO2e (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="9556">e</st></strong><st c="9558"> stands for </st><strong class="bold"><st c="9570">equivalent</st></strong><st c="9580"> –not every gas originated </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9607">is CO2)</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="9614">This range is comparable with the CO2e share of Indonesia (1.48%), Canada (1.89%) or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9700">Germany (2.17%)</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="9715">Predictions in 2018 assumed that these numbers would double by 2025; some less trustworthy sources even predict 12% increase in CO2e </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9849">by 2025</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="9856">We don’t have to shut down everything and start living like cavemen again, but we should at least become aware of the impact of our </st><em class="italic"><st c="9989">infinite</st></em><st c="9997"> computing resources on the environment. </st><st c="10038">Computing resources, of any kind, causes the output of CO2e during their production, their usage via the electricity they need, and when retired </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10183">and destroyed.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="10197">The best things we can do, therefore, are </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10240">as follows:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="10251">Reduce</st></strong><st c="10258">: Reduction is all about being sustainable about what we consume. </st><st c="10325">In our daily lives, we don’t have to take plastic bags, but what do you do with digital resources? </st><st c="10424">Well, it’s simple – do we really need an ultra-highly available web server distributed over five continents with hourly </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10544">cross-location backups?</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="10567">Reuse</st></strong><st c="10573">: In IT, reuse has two aspects. </st><st c="10606">If a server gets retired, it might make sense not to destroy it but to sell it to a provider who specializes in running legacy servers. </st><st c="10742">Second, we should keep using the server as long as possible. </st><st c="10803">This is also a form of reusing it. </st><st c="10838">Kubernetes, as an orchestrator, makes this extremely simple and enables us with well-proofed balancing if there is </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10953">a failure.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="10963">Repair</st></strong><st c="10970">:  Most of us do not have the capability to repair servers. </st><st c="11030">Often, individual components such as memory modules or network </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11093">devices fail.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="11106">Rightsize</st></strong><st c="11116">: Adjust the requested computing capacities, on-premise and in the cloud, to fit your workload. </st><st c="11213">The era of 80% headspace on a server is over. </st><st c="11259">Those who don’t use their compute resources at least 90% are practically harming </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11340">the planet.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="11351">Reject</st></strong><st c="11358">: Don’t work with providers who are not committed to reaching sustainability targets. </st><st c="11445">It is up to you to add this as a criterion to your vendor </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11503">selection processes.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="11523">Replatform</st></strong><st c="11534">: Be aware if a vendor or platform is not committed or doesn’t support </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11606">sustainable targets.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="11626">Now, you might say that the business case for “sustainability” is not very economically interesting. </st><st c="11728">You might even have gotten the feeling that we discussed actions we should take previously. </st><st c="11820">Reducing costs often comes along with optimizing your CO2 footprint. </st><st c="11889">Therefore, optimizing your footprint also positively impacts your costs. </st><st c="11962">Further, more and more regulations are being shaped to achieve a slower-growing global warming. </st><st c="12058">Fulfilling those regulations is better than </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12102">pa</st><a id="_idTextAnchor519"/><st c="12104">ying fines.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor520"/><st c="12116">Enable lightweight architectures</st></h2>
			<p><st c="12149">Enabling lightweight architecture should be a primary target for a platform. </st><st c="12227">It not only has benefits in regard to sustainability but also to its robustness and the ability to forgive failure. </st><st c="12343">The architecture of an application becomes lightweight when it doesn’t have hard dependencies, utilizes fewer components, is flexible in its deployment (which includes scalability), and uses just the right technologies. </st><st c="12563">A good example here is Apache Kafka, which became a </st><a id="_idIndexMarker990"/><st c="12615">kind of de facto standard in the context of stream processing. </st><st c="12678">However, I have seen more systems using it just to transport logs and events and consolidate data flow. </st><st c="12782">There are dozens of more lightweight and efficient tools out there that provide the same capabilities, just without the scale, the resource demand, and the overhead of complexity. </st><st c="12962">This pattern is very common. </st><st c="12991">We prefer to take a solution that answers our demand and can do so much more, even though we don’t need it although others do, so it has to be the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13138">right choice.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="13151">Whatever we choose, to enable lightweight architectures as a platform team, we have to provide technological options to be able to provide two to three better answers to a demand, rather than th</st><a id="_idTextAnchor521"/><st c="13346">e </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13349">wrong one.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor522"/><st c="13359">Providing support for the users to adapt</st></h2>
			<p><st c="13400">How do we support users now </st><a id="_idIndexMarker991"/><st c="13429">and allow them to optimize their systems </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13470">going forward?</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="13484">We give them transparency about their impact, we show them the possible platform capabilities to scale, balance, and</st><a id="_idIndexMarker992"/><st c="13601"> run serverless, and we provide alternative lightweight technologies. </st><st c="13671">This can be an integrated part of our </st><strong class="bold"><st c="13709">Internal Development Platform</st></strong><st c="13738"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="13740">IDP</st></strong><st c="13743">) </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13746">and observability.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="13764">To create transparency of the carbon footprint, open source tools such as Kepler, Scaphandre, as well as commercial solutions provide insights into which system component causes which CO2e output. </st><st c="13962">The following screenshot from Kepler shows a simple Grafana dashboard with the energy consumption </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14060">per component.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="28804">What should be obvious when looking at this example is that creating Golden Paths is actually not that hard. </st><st c="28914">Sure, there are some specifics that we can’t cover in this short section of the book, but it shows that tooling such as Backstage already exists that makes it very easy to create or update Golden Path templates. </st><st c="29126">This also allows platform engineering teams to enable other teams to help create and update their own Golden Paths, thereby reducing the chances that the core platform engineering team becomes </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="29319">a bottleneck.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="29332">While we use Backstage as an example, there are also other tools out there that provide similar flexibility. </st><st c="29442">You should make yourself familiar with the tools available in the open source space, and also look into commercial offerings. </st><st c="29568">One additional open source project to have a look at is </st><strong class="bold"><st c="29624">Kratix</st></strong><st c="29630"> – </st><em class="italic"><st c="29633">the open source platform engineering framework</st></em> <em class="italic"><st c="29679">[3]</st></em><st c="29683">.
