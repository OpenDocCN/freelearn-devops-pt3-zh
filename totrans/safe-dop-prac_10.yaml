    discretion. We still want a deployment to a production environment as part of
    the development cadence, but the actual release becomes a business decision. For
    this reason, we look to separate the deployment from the release.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Architecture may play a key role in allowing the separation of the deployment
    from the release. Separating deployment and release relies on technology such
    as feature Flags, which the architecture must accommodate. These feature Flags
    easily allow the Continuous Deployment of new features without disrupting the
    current functionality when switched *off*. A new feature is considered released
    when the Feature Flag is switched *on*. Applications of Feature Flags include
    canary releases and dark launches. An architecture with loosely coupled components
    allows each component to have its own separate release schedule. This allows components
    that require different release strategies to have them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or business objectives. Releases may need to be done to respond to the marketplace
    or outmaneuver a competitor. The ability to allow for a flexible release can be
    a competitive advantage. We will see the benefits of this foresight in [*Chapter

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We saw before that a loosely coupled architecture allows for flexibility through
    the ability to release components on different schedules. This flexibility extends
    to designing systems that allow more testing to occur. Systems whose components
    have well-defined interfaces allow for more frequent system-level testing by having
    components that are not ready for integration with other components, replaced
    with dummy code or logic that returns valid outputs.

    Programming Interface** (**API**)-based architecture by adopting the **Strangler

    system and establishes a facade interface to those entities communicating with
    the legacy system. New code is incrementally written to replace pieces of the
    interface. Eventually, all the functions of the legacy system are replaced by
    the new code.

    and security of the system.

    staging and production environments to monitor its resources to determine whether
    any adverse performance is present with the active system. Alerts should be designed
    when thresholds are violated. This ability to measure resource use from low levels
    to higher levels is commonly referred to as full-stack telemetry.

    Feature Flags, a common tool for separating deployment into production environments

    in a presentation made after the business owner’s presentation.

- en: The selected group of features intended to be worked on in the upcoming PI is
    communicated to the Agile teams on the ART. The teams can choose which features
    they may want to contribute to and begin looking at these features closely. They
    may want to start breaking those features down into stories, as we will see in
    [*Chapter 11*](B18756_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor244), *Continuous Integration of Solution
    Development*, and may also look for any risks or dependencies.

- en: In this chapter, we looked at the activities that trigger the Continuous Delivery
    Pipeline. With Continuous Exploration, the ART examines the marketplace and the
    wants and needs of its customers to generate ideas for new products or new features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process begins with the understanding that development is really a series
    of incremental build-measure-learn cycles that start by creating a hypothesis
    of the customer value that can be achieved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The collaborative process then begins for product management and the system
    architect. Product management collaborates with the customer to gain a greater
    understanding of the customer and marketplace. The system architect researches
    the hypothesis to understand the impact that the changes will have on the architecture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When research is complete, the ART will take what it has learned and create
    features. They will elaborate on these features, place them into the Program Backlog,
    and prioritize them. A set of the highest sequenced features will be selected
    for the upcoming PI. Those selected are communicated to the ART to prepare for
    the next phase of PI planning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After PI planning, the ART sets to work on development. This development work
    starts on the next phase of the Continuous Delivery Pipeline, Continuous Integration.
    We will explore what Continuous Integration involves in detail in our next chapter.
