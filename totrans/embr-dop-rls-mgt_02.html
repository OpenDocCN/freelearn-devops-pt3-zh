<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Release management</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1"> is a comprehensive set of activities that involve</span><a id="_idIndexMarker076"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1"> strategic planning, conceptualization, scheduling, rigorous testing, seamless deployment, and the effective</span><a id="_idIndexMarker077"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1"> control of a software release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">The primary objective of this practice is to facilitate the quick delivery of essential application features and enhancements to the customer by software development teams while simultaneously upholding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of an established </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">production environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">In the competitive landscape of business and IT, product releases that lack quality or features are the quickest way to give your competitor an advantage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Modern enterprises are dynamic, and multitudes of changes get completed at varying paces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">Enterprises need release control and deployment automation to orchestrate all of these changes so that the final product delivers the exceptional value that their customers expect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">Successful release management enhances the frequency with which releases are completed and decreases the frequency with which quality issues arise for a business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.5">As a result, businesses can provide software more quickly while also reducing the associated risks, yielding increased productivity, communication, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">and co-operation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Because of these enhancements, the team is now able to generate high-quality software on a consistent basis in far less time than before, which enables the organization to be more responsive to the demands of customers or changes in the operational environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Standardizing and streamlining the development and operations process is another benefit of release management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">The group establishes release controls that can be audited, resulting in a central location from which all releases can be retrieved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.4">The maturity of an organization can be further improved by instituting a standard, written procedure for all releases to follow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.5">Teams can learn more from past releases and apply that knowledge to future iterations if they standardize and concentrate on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">the product.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">The improved communication between operations and developers is well-received because it results in fewer surprises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Now, cross-functional teams will not have to worry about operations being left to </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">patch and pray</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"> or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">fight fires</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> because of missed deadlines after a release has been </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">thrown over the wall</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1"> from development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">As a result, more time is available for automating business processes or fixing incompatibilities in the configurations of integrations in the development</span><a id="_idIndexMarker078"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1"> and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">production</span></span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker079"/></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> environments.</span></span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Fight fires</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">:  In the field of computer</span><a id="_idIndexMarker082"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> science, firefighting involves allocating resources to solve an unforeseen issue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">The word indicates bug hunting rather than feature integration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">Firefighting may involve adding engineers to fix problems with code discovered near a product’s release deadlines during </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">software development.</span></span><p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Plenty of businesses are ready for firefighting situations, but recurring emergencies indicate poor planning</span><a id="_idIndexMarker083"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1"> or inefficiency and wasted resources that could be used elsewhere. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Comprehensive </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">disaster recovery planning</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">DRP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">) anticipates and perhaps prevents catastrophes, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">minimizing firefighting.</span></span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Thrown over the wall</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">: This is business slang for completing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker084"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> your part of a project and then passing it off to the next group. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">This phrase is usually said when there is little communication between two groups or little to no time for technical briefings just prior to a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">new deployment.</span></span></li>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">A brief history of release management</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">The transition in focus of software engineering</span><a id="_idIndexMarker085"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1"> from project-based to product-based offerings is responsible for the growing importance of release management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">From the inception of release management, tasks were executed within the framework of a project-based development paradigm. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">In this approach, software developers treated each release as an independent project rather than as a product. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.4">Once the software was finished being developed, it generally signaled the end of the developers’ role in the process, and then they would </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">be disbanded.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Over the course of time, the process of software development gradually evolved to bear a greater resemblance to the product cycle, wherein products undergo support, enhancement, and many relaunches across an extended lifespan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Within this particular structure, the primary objective of development was not the release itself, but rather, the release served as a demarcation point for the start of support and revision activities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">Because of this complexity, phase co-ordination has become more important than ever. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">For this reason, modern release management draws ideas from business-oriented product management, which includes post-sale support </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">and enhancements.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">The evolution from software to release management</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">When British computer</span><a id="_idIndexMarker086"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"> scientist Tom Kilburn created </span><a id="_idIndexMarker087"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">the first piece of software in 1948, he used eight words of working storage and 17 words of instructions, for a total of 25 words. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">Since then, software development processes have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">advanced significantly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">In spite of his coworker’s mockery, in 1953, Paul Niquette proposed the concept of a computer whose program could be kept separate from the physical components of the device. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">From that point forward, this revolutionized the way that people </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">conceived computation:</span></span></p>
<p class="author-quote"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">When I first said ‘software’ out loud, people around me said, “Huh?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write and often embarrassing to say. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation I did occasionally feature the word ‘software’ in speeches and lectures and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">After the strategy is complete, the following</span><a id="_idIndexMarker125"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1"> step is to design and develop the product. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.2">Plans and strategies developed in response to these specified requirements can now be put into action. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.3">In order to complete this step, your programmers will need to write the code that will eventually be able to convert to the features or functionalities that you plan to add to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">your product.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">This stage can repeat itself multiple times over the course of the whole release cycle, much like the continuous development strategy in DevOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.2">After the developer has finished writing the code, there is a possibility that it contains a number of problems, faults, and defects that need to be tested. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.3">Multiple rounds of testing will be performed on the code before it is finally accepted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.4">The whole list of problems that need to be resolved and optimized should be provided to the developers so that they can prioritize their backlog and produce software that performs</span><a id="_idIndexMarker126"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1"> as it was intended. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">One way </span><a id="_idIndexMarker127"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">to help with this</span><a id="_idIndexMarker128"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1"> is through the use of bug-tracking tools, such as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">FindBugs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">Eslint</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">and </span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">Sonarlint</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">As stated previously, testing code</span><a id="_idIndexMarker129"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1"> is necessary to guarantee there are no errors or defects that could compromise the software’s functionality, speed, or safety. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.2">Manual testing is better than no testing at all, but automated testing should be implemented </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">where possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">The terms functional testing and non-functional testing are sometimes used incorrectly as interchangeable concepts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.2">As mentioned in </span><a href="B21803_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">Chapter 1</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">, there are many different types of testing that can be performed, and they all usually fall under these two categories. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.2">When problems are found, the code is then sent back to the developers so that they can fix the issues and resubmit the code for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">further review.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">User acceptance testing is the final step before releasing the software product to the end users, during which the customer will verify that it meets their needs and operates as intended. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.2">The next steps are dependent on the user’s acceptance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.3">Otherwise, comments from users </span><a id="_idIndexMarker130"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">are used to revise the code, which is then tested further before </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">being released.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">Additionally, the QA team will be in charge of carrying out the final tests to guarantee that the finished product satisfies all of the product release plan’s business requirements and minimal standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">After that, it will be examined by the management or the owner of the product to ensure that it may be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">shipped out.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">At this point, the documentation that was required to assist other developers in comprehending the software and learning how to utilize it has been completed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">In addition, the teams complete all of the required documentation in order to hand off the finished product to the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.3">In addition to this, companies should think about providing their consumers or staff with training on how to utilize the new product so that they can operate with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">it productively.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">Summary</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">Now that we have arrived at the end of this chapter let’s quickly revisit the main takeaways from this lesson. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.2">You now know the meaning of release management and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">its history.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">Understanding where you are in your release management process is vital. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.2">You should approach this from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.3">Gathering some fundamental data, such as the average release timings, the kinds and priority of releases, the number of errors, and the number of delayed releases, is an important step in the quantitative analysis process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.4">These are used to determine performance baselines as well as the present state of release management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.5">In terms of the quality of the information, talk to the people who are involved in the release management process, particularly in the areas where development interacts with operations, and find out what their thoughts are. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.6">They will be able to point out realities that are not clearly reflected in the data </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">and statistics.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">Establishing a regular release cycle leads to the creation of consistency, enabling you to gain control over your release management tasks and duties. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.2">Instead of focusing on trying to establish a culture right from the start, put lightweight release processes in place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.3">Because of this, you are able to set up the infrastructure for releases at an earlier stage, test it, and make adjustments to it as required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.4">Over the course of time, the procedures that are most effective will eventually become your organization’s standard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.5">Following the completion of your initial research, you will be better positioned to initiate more stringent quality criteria and make improvements to efficiency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.6">Eliminating downtime and testing for regressions are two ways to reduce the impact that releases have on your users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.7">At that point, you can also begin to think about normalizing and automating procedures, such as testing and verification, which are both essential steps in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">development process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">It takes time for a truly collaborative culture of release management to mature, and it requires a well-managed infrastructure as a foundation on which to mature. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.2">You can nurture this culture by making investments in your team and investing in release management tools and approaches that enable people to take a holistic view of every phase of the release management process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.3">Both of these types of investments will help you build a culture of excellence and make work </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">more visible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">This concludes </span><a href="B21803_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor036"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">Chapter 2</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.2">In this chapter, we have learned what release management is from both a cultural and technical perspective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.3">Then, we explored a brief history of release management and how the various models have originated over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.4">Finally, you’ve seen the standard six phases of release management that any model </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">should have.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">In </span><a href="B21803_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor051"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">, we will dive deep into the mechanics of the most common release management Models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.2">The significant point to make here is that it’s nearly impossible to fully appreciate the meaning of DevOps if you aren’t familiar with the release management models that came </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">before it.</span></span></p>
