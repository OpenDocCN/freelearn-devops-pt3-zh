			<h1 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor301"/>A Flosum overview</h1>
			<p>As you would expect<a id="_idIndexMarker581"/> of a modern, Salesforce-specific DevOps solution, Flosum provides a broad spectrum of capabilities that cover the main facets of Salesforce DevOps. In this section, we’ll take a look at these core elements and see how Flosum <span class="No-Break">addresses them.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor302"/>Deployments</h2>
			<p>The core of Flosum’s offering is<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> its DevOps module, a comprehensive suite designed to facilitate the entire development life cycle. It offers an integrated environment for managing code, configurations, and continuous integration, thereby streamlining the <span class="No-Break">delivery process.</span></p>
			<p>Flosum’s approach to deployment and change management is both innovative and practical. It handles pre- and post-deployment changes effectively, treating modifications as delta branches. This granularity ensures that only relevant changes are deployed, minimizing the risk of errors and enhancing <span class="No-Break">deployment efficiency.</span></p>
			<p>The Domains feature in Flosum revolutionizes the management of multiple production orgs, offering a structured and unified approach. Alongside this, the Deployment Manager serves as a key tool to orchestrate deployments across various Salesforce Orgs, simplifying what would otherwise be a <span class="No-Break">complex task.</span></p>
			<p>Flosum’s advanced features, such as the pre-deploy fix capability and overwrite protection, demonstrate its sophistication. These tools proactively identify and resolve common issues such as API version mismatches, offering a more streamlined deployment process. The peer review process, akin to Git’s pull requests, further underscores Flosum’s commitment to collaborative and <span class="No-Break">error-free development.</span></p>
			<p>Unique to Flosum is its approach to managing profiles and permission sets. It enables partial retrieval and deployment, focusing only on components relevant to the current branch. This specificity not only saves time but also reduces the complexity <span class="No-Break">of deployments.</span></p>
			<p>Flosum’s DevOps workflow is characterized by versatility, offering two primary operational methods – <strong class="bold">source tracking via the Salesforce Tooling API</strong> and <strong class="bold">snapshot-based difference tracking</strong>. The source tracking capability makes use of Salesforce’s own source tracking functionality, which was introduced for Salesforce DX and works in the same way in Flosum, whereas the snapshot feature not only aids in identifying changes but also facilitates efficient rollbacks, enhancing the overall robustness of the development process. An example snapshot in Flosum is <span class="No-Break">shown here:</span></p>

			<p class="callout">The textual detail in the above figure is minimized and is not directly relevant for the display of the graphic. Please refer to the Free eBook download to access the detail in <span class="No-Break">the graphic.</span></p>
			<p>The process of <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>deployment validation in Flosum is meticulous, resulting in a comprehensive metadata log. This log serves as a crucial record, providing insights into each deployment’s history and aiding in future audits and analyses. The following screenshot shows an example of the extensive metadata logs attached to <span class="No-Break">a deployment.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer049">

			<p>Flosum’s approach to pipelines and automation is both flexible and powerful. Users can create individual automations and orchestrate them as needed, without being constrained to a fixed sequence. This flexibility allows teams to tailor their DevOps processes to their <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>specific project needs. The following screenshot shows an example pipeline, complete with a visual representation of the flow of <span class="No-Break">the automation.</span></p>
			<div>

			<p>The Deployment Manager is Flosum’s answer to CI/CD orchestration. It allows for the stacking of <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>automation pipelines, offering a centralized and efficient way to manage continuous integration and delivery across multiple projects <span class="No-Break">and environments.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor303"/>The Trust Center</h2>
			<p>The Trust Center serves as the <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>cornerstone of security within Flosum, offering robust tools for monitoring and ensuring compliance. This module periodically scans Salesforce Orgs, generating alerts for any detected security breaches or policy violations, and is a testament to Flosum’s commitment to security and compliance. It not only monitors Salesforce Orgs for potential security breaches but also automates the generation of violation alerts and remediation changes. This proactive approach to security ensures that Orgs remain compliant <span class="No-Break">and secure.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>Backup and Data Migrator</h2>
			<p>Recognizing the <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>critical nature of data integrity, Flosum’s Backup and Data Migrator module provides robust solutions for both full and incremental backups. This module stands out for its support of big objects and binary data, ensuring comprehensive <span class="No-Break">data protection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor305"/>Integrations and customizations</h2>
			<p>Flosum’s integration <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>capabilities are a testament to its flexibility. While it offers built-in source control and ticket tracking workflows, it can additionally connect with external applications, such as Jira and Azure DevOps, add flexibility, while Flosum Scan and AccelQ cover the spectrum of code scanning and regression testing. Branch management features such as permissioning, peer review, and merge tracking further attest to Flosum’s commitment to a streamlined and secure DevOps process. This interoperability enables teams to leverage Flosum within their existing workflows, enhancing productivity without disrupting <span class="No-Break">established processes.</span></p>
			<p>Built natively on the Salesforce platform, Flosum offers unprecedented extensibility. Users can tailor reports, dashboards, and layouts to their specific needs, ensuring a highly personalized and efficient DevOps experience. This customization extends beyond aesthetics, allowing teams to adapt the tool to their unique <span class="No-Break">workflow requirements.</span></p>
			<p>By using Salesforce’s comprehensive reporting and dashboard capabilities, Flosum provides vital insights into deployment metrics. These tools are indispensable for tracking progress, identifying bottlenecks, and making <span class="No-Break">data-driven decisions.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 14.1 – A summary of Flosum’s DevOps capabilities</p>
			<p>Now that we’ve seen the range of DevOps features that Flosum offers, let’s dig a little deeper and identify <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>where the product’s strengths and <span class="No-Break">weaknesses lie.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>Flosum’s strengths</h1>
			<p>Flosum is strong in a<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> great many areas and will certainly meet the needs of most Salesforce teams. Here are some of the key strengths of <span class="No-Break">this platform:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Native integration with Salesforce</strong>: It offers seamless compatibility and an intuitive user experience for those accustomed to Salesforce, simplifying operations and enhancing <span class="No-Break">user experience</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A comprehensive toolset</strong>: It includes features for source control management, deployment automation, backup and recovery, and security and compliance monitoring, addressing a broad spectrum of <span class="No-Break">DevOps processes</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customization and extensibility</strong>: It allows extensive customization of reports, dashboards, and layouts to meet specific workflow requirements, adaptable to diverse <span class="No-Break">team needs</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Advanced deployment management</strong>: The Deployment Manager is capable of handling complex scenarios, including managing multiple Salesforce Orgs, streamlining the deployment <span class="No-Break">life cycle</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security and compliance</strong>: It features a Trust Center module and other security functionalities for robust security monitoring and compliance, maintaining data integrity and adhering to <span class="No-Break">regulatory standards</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration with external tools</strong>: It’s compatible with tools such as GitHub and Jira, offering flexibility in using built-in or preferred external source control and ticket <span class="No-Break">tracking workflows</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">Pipeline and automation flexibility</strong>: It enables teams to create and orchestrate custom <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>pipelines, automating processes to increase efficiency and meet dynamic <span class="No-Break">DevOps needs</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor307"/>Flosum’s weaknesses</h1>
			<p>Flosum, while a robust<a id="_idIndexMarker592"/> Salesforce DevOps solution, comes with certain limitations that might impact its suitability for some organizations. One of the primary constraints is its platform-specific focus. Designed exclusively for Salesforce, Flosum excels in this environment but may not be the ideal solution for companies looking for a more platform-agnostic DevOps tool. This specialization, while a boon for Salesforce-centric operations, limits its utility in more diverse technological landscapes where multiple platforms are <span class="No-Break">in use.</span></p>
			<p>For teams not deeply entrenched in the Salesforce ecosystem, Flosum presents a noticeable learning curve. Its functionalities and operations are tightly woven into the Salesforce platform, which can be challenging for those unfamiliar with Salesforce’s nuances. This aspect could potentially slow the adoption and efficient utilization of Flosum in a non-Salesforce <span class="No-Break">proficient environment.</span></p>
			<p>Cost is another consideration that cannot be overlooked. Flosum’s specialized nature and extensive features come with a price tag that could be prohibitive for smaller organizations or start-ups operating with constrained budgets. This aspect makes it less accessible for smaller teams seeking cost-effective DevOps solutions, but it is worth noting that this is true of all paid vendor-provided solutions, not <span class="No-Break">just Flosum.</span></p>
			<p>Integration with non-Salesforce tools, while supported for a considerable number of solutions, is not always seamless, requiring additional plugins or manual setup and installations. This limitation can be a significant drawback for teams that rely on a diverse array of tools and systems outside the Salesforce sphere. The need for broader integration capabilities might be more pronounced in environments where Salesforce is just one of many platforms <span class="No-Break">in use.</span></p>
			<p>Flosum’s dependency on the Salesforce platform means that its performance and capabilities are subject to Salesforce’s own performance levels and governor limits. Such a dependency could potentially lead to bottlenecks, as was observed with some slow page load times <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>during testing. This reliance on Salesforce’s infrastructure and limitations might impact Flosum’s efficiency and scalability, particularly in complex or <span class="No-Break">large-scale operations.</span></p>
			<p>The comprehensive nature of Flosum, while a strength, also carries the risk of over-complexity. Some teams might find themselves overwhelmed by its extensive features, many of which may go unused in simpler deployment scenarios. This complexity could lead to inefficiencies, especially for teams that prefer a more <span class="No-Break">streamlined toolset.</span></p>
			<p>As per previous chapters on major Salesforce DevOps platforms, here’s a quick summary table to aid your <span class="No-Break">decisioning process.</span></p>
