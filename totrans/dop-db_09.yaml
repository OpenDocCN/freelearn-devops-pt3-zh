- en: The role of a DevOps **Database Administrator** (**DBA**) is a crucial one as
    it bridges a gap – that between the database and the rest of the application.
    In traditional environments, changes to the database are often a source of risk
    and delay in software releases. DBAs are usually seen as gatekeepers, carefully
    guarding the data and ensuring its integrity, often at the expense of speed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, in a DevOps culture, the DBA’s role must evolve. Instead of being a
    gatekeeper, the DevOps DBA becomes a facilitator, helping the development and
    operations teams to work with the database effectively and efficiently without
    compromising its reliability, integrity, or security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A DevOps DBA maintains the database in production environments, troubleshoots
    any issues, and is actively involved in the design and decision-making processes.
    They play a vital role in making sure that the database integrates smoothly with
    the CI/CD pipeline. They use infrastructure as code to create and manage databases,
    allowing for consistency across all environments and making the creation and teardown
    of databases quicker and more efficient.

    retrieved, and manipulated plays a pivotal role in determining the efficiency
    and reliability of systems. At the heart of this is the art and science of database
    design, which serves as the foundation for many applications, from simple websites
    to sophisticated machine learning models. Mastering the principles of database
    design, including understanding, organizing, maintaining, and securing data, is
    indispensable for anyone aiming to leverage the full potential of modern systems.
    Moreover, as database technologies evolve and diversify, the choices between RDBMS,
    NoSQL, and NewSQL become increasingly nuanced, warranting a deeper exploration
    of their respective strengths and use cases. In this section, we aim to shed light
    on these crucial facets, guiding you through the labyrinth of database intricacies.

    to store and manipulate data. The core principles revolve around understanding
    your data, organizing it well, maintaining its integrity, and ensuring its security.
    We will look at each of the core principles in detail as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Understanding your data**: The first step in designing a database is understanding
    what kind of data you are working with and how it is related. This often involves
    working closely with stakeholders and potential end users to identify the information
    that the system needs to store and manipulate.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Organizing your data**: Once you have a good understanding of your data,
    you can start organizing it. Here, you employ techniques such as data normalization
    and denormalization. Normalization is the process of structuring the data to minimize
    redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table relationships. Denormalization
    is the process of combining tables to improve read performance at the cost of
    some write performance.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Maintaining data integrity**: Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency
    of data. The aim is to prevent data from becoming corrupt or inaccurate. This
    can be achieved through constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique,
    check, and not null constraints.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Ensuring data security**: Data security refers to protective measures put
    in place to keep data safe from unauthorized access or alterations. This involves
    implementing appropriate user permissions and roles, encrypting data both at rest
    and in transit, and regularly auditing database activity.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A concrete example of designing a scalable, robust, and secure database is the
    creation of an e-commerce platform database. It involves understanding the necessary
    data, including products, customers, orders, and payments, and identifying the
    relationships between them. A highly normalized schema can be designed to avoid
    data redundancy. However, to improve read operations, some level of denormalization
    might be used, such as creating view tables that aggregate product and order data
    for quick access.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data integrity can be maintained by setting up primary keys, foreign keys, and
    other constraints. For instance, a foreign key constraint can be set up between
    orders and customers, ensuring that every order is always associated with a valid
    customer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data security can be ensured by creating different roles with different access
    levels. For example, a sales role might have read access to product and order
    data but no access to payment data. All data can be encrypted using industry-standard
    protocols to protect it from unauthorized access. Regular audits can also be set
    up to monitor database activity and identify potential security breaches.

    needs of the application you’re building. The choice is generally among **Relational
    Database Management System** (**RDBMS**), NoSQL, and NewSQL databases:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**RDBMS**: These databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, are based
    on a relational model where data is stored in tables, and relationships are formed
    using primary and foreign keys. RDBMS databases are a great choice for applications
    that require complex transactions with multiple operations or queries that require
    aggregation. They’re also excellent for maintaining data integrity and supporting
    SQL for a robust, declarative query language.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**NoSQL**: NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and CouchDB, do not
    adhere to the traditional relational database structure. Instead, they can store
    data in several ways: document-based, column-based, graph-based, or key-value
    pairs. NoSQL databases are ideal for applications with large amounts of data or
    need to scale horizontally. They’re designed to excel in speed and flexibility.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**NewSQL**: NewSQL databases such as CockroachDB, VoltDB, and MemSQL attempt
    to combine the best of both worlds. They offer the scalability of NoSQL databases
    and the ACID transactions of RDBMS. NewSQL databases are designed to overcome
    the limitations of traditional RDBMSs in distributed environments and provide
    horizontal scalability while maintaining the strong consistency of traditional
    databases.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Making a decision among these types of databases depends on various factors
    such as the data structure, scalability, consistency, and latency requirements
    of your application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider the case of a large-scale, distributed, write-heavy application such
    as a real-time analytics system. Here, the primary need is to handle a huge volume
    of write operations with low latency and to distribute data across multiple nodes
    for redundancy and availability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For such an application, a traditional RDBMS such as MySQL might not be the
    best fit. MySQL follows a strong consistency model that can become a bottleneck
    when write operations are exceptionally high. Also, while it’s possible to distribute
    a MySQL database across multiple nodes, doing so can be complex and may not offer
    the same level of performance or ease of scalability as a system designed with
    distribution in mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, a NoSQL database such as Apache Cassandra could be a much
    better fit. Cassandra is designed to handle large amounts of data across many
    commodity servers, providing high write throughput and low latency. It follows
    an “eventual consistency” model, which means it prioritizes availability and partition
    tolerance. This makes it a good choice for write-heavy applications where it’s
    acceptable for data to be slightly out of sync across nodes for a short period.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cassandra’s data model, based on the wide-column store paradigm, is another
    point of consideration. It allows you to store large amounts of data in a semi-structured
    manner, offering more flexibility than the rigid schema of an RDBMS.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NewSQL databases could also be a possible choice here, as they attempt to combine
    the scalability of NoSQL with the ACID transactions of RDBMS. However, given their
    relative newness in the field, they may not be the best choice for all applications.
    In a high-volume, write-heavy scenario like our example, Cassandra’s proven scalability
    and performance might make it a safer bet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
