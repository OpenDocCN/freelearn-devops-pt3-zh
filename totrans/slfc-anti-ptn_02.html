     How to Keep Your System Architecture Clean

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">
     This chapter will start by exploring how you can muddle up your system landscape by not retaining a disciplined approach to implementation and governance.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">
     We’ll examine the classic Stovepipe anti-pattern, where systems are built in isolation with little regard for standards or common abstractions, leading to a fragmented and hard-to-maintain architecture.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">
     We’ll also look at the Big Ball of Mud anti-pattern, characterized by a lack of structure and organization, resulting in an

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">
     Next, we’ll introduce the Architecture as Requirements anti-pattern, a common pitfall where architectural decisions are treated as mere requirements without considering the broader system context and long-term implications.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">
     We’ll delve into the consequences of this approach, such as increased technical debt, scalability issues, and

     We’ll also touch on the challenges of org proliferation in Salesforce environments and the need for a well-defined org strategy to prevent sprawl and

     Frustrated but undeterred, Sarah had tried to work within the confines of the project’s requirement-driven approach.

     She attended sprint planning meetings, hoping to inject architectural considerations into the development process.

     She knew that treating the AI implementation as just another requirement to be checked off would likely lead to problems down the line.

     But without buy-in from the rest of the team, her hands

     As the project progressed, Sarah’s fears began to materialize.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">
     The hastily implemented lead scoring system was causing performance issues, bogging down the entire Salesforce instance during peak usage times.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.3">
     The data model had become a tangled mess, with redundant fields and inconsistent naming conventions making it difficult to generate

     Integration with other systems was becoming a nightmare.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">
     The team had opted for quick, point-to-point integrations rather than following Sarah’s proposed API-first approach.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.3">
     As a result, data inconsistencies were cropping up across different departments, and any changes to one system had a ripple effect that was hard to predict

     User adoption was also suffering.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">
     The lack of a coherent architectural vision had resulted in a disjointed user experience, with different modules feeling like separate applications rather than parts of a unified whole.

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">
     “The root of our problems,” Sarah began, “is that we’ve been treating architecture as just another set of requirements rather than as the foundational framework it should be.

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">
     However, shortly before John has a meeting to pitch his ideas to the CIO, things change rapidly on the ground.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.2">
     DreamCo has recently hired Ricky, an experienced architect from one of the big consultancies, to help figure out how to integrate the DreamCo and NewCo orgs.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.3">
     While he has generally been supportive of John’s effort to get refactoring started, it clearly hasn’t been at the top of

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">
     Instead, he proposes to focus DreamCo’s efforts on the Salesforce side into an integration project to combine the two orgs.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.2">
     He proposes to do much of the technical work himself, using a third-party tool that he has previously used on other projects.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.3">
     The integration will be point-to-point, but it will reliably ferry the data needed back and forth between the two environments and end the complex manual processes that the business has had to use to bridge the gap in

   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">
     Given the pressure on the business, the CIO decides to go ahead with Ricky’s plan, and he implements the solution over a 2-month period more or less single-handedly.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">
     John is told that his refactoring project will get the go-ahead after the integration is complete.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.3">
     However, once it’s done, the CIO gives the go-ahead to a new set of feature upgrades on the existing platform for both the Sales and Service teams.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.4">
     John is told that the business can’t wait for any new features and that instead, he will need to lead the development of a new logistics app that the business wants to build in a separate Salesforce org, with Ricky acting as the

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">
     The new app is built quickly in the new environment but John remains concerned that it is being built with very little structure or discipline.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.2">
     The business seems to love what they’re seeing, so John relents and lets things go ahead, supporting where he can.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.3">
     While the app was meant to be an experimental prototype, the business decides it wants to put it into production as is.

     Major functional areas don’t seem to be working, the integration between the DreamCo and the NewCo org starts experiencing errors, and many test scripts that were working in the main org or the logistics org fail completely.

     Summary
    </span>
   </h1>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.1">
     In this chapter, we explored several anti-patterns that can arise when organizations fail to take a disciplined, architecture-driven approach to
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.1">
      Salesforce implementations.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.1">
     We started by examining the Stovepipe anti-pattern, where systems are built in isolation with little regard for standards or common abstractions, leading to a landscape of disconnected, hard-to-maintain applications.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.2">
     We then looked at the Big Ball of Mud anti-pattern, characterized by a lack of structure and organization, resulting in an
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.748.1">
      unmaintainable system.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.749.1">
     Next, we introduced the Architecture as Requirements anti-pattern, a common pitfall where architectural decisions are treated as mere requirements without considering the broader system context and long-term implications.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.749.2">
     We explored the consequences of this approach, such as increased technical debt, scalability issues, and
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.750.1">
      limited adaptability.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.751.1">
     We also discussed the dangers of intense coupling between systems and modules, highlighting the importance of clear boundaries and favoring looser integration patterns to maintain system stability
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.1">
      and flexibility.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.753.1">
     Finally, we touched on the challenges of org proliferation in Salesforce environments and the need for a well-defined org strategy and governance model to prevent sprawl and ensure consistency
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.754.1">
      across implementations.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.755.1">
     Throughout the chapter, we emphasized the critical role of architecture governance, technical standards, and best practices in avoiding these anti-patterns.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.755.2">
     We stressed the importance of securing business support, fostering collaboration, and striking a balance between individual requirements and long-term
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.756.1">
      architectural sustainability.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.1">
     By understanding these anti-patterns and following the guidance provided, Salesforce architects can create more robust, maintainable, and evolvable systems that deliver lasting value to their organizations.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.2">
     The key is to approach architecture proactively, think holistically, and continuously refine and adapt the system to meet changing
