				<li value="1">C<p><strong class="bold">Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>) is a cloud service model that gives you access to virtualized infrastructure components comprising computing, network, and storage services. This is very similar to hosting your own VMware or Hyper-V virtualized platforms, where you deploy servers, attach storage volumes, and configure network connectivity services. However, the primary difference is that you do not have access to the underlying hypervisor platform with cloud-hosted IaaS solutions. IaaS offerings give the greatest amount of control over how the virtual components of your infrastructure are configured and also require you to take responsibility for managing, maintaining, and enforcing security measures for those components.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Companies who wish to move their entire suite of applications to the cloud would normally carry out a series of migration projects over time. During this migration phase, connectivity between the on-premises environment and the AWS cloud would be required to facilitate the migration. Many companies may also require a more permanent hybrid design architecture. This could be because certain types of applications need to be in much closer proximity to the on-premises infrastructure where users are based, such as your corporate office network, ultimately ensuring low-latency access, data residency requirements, or even unique local data processing requirements. AWS offers several services to build hybrid clouds from VPN technologies and Direct Connect services to offering on-premises services such as AWS Storage Gateway and AWS Outposts.</p></li>
				<li>A and B<p>There are several reasons why you would choose a specific AWS Region to deploy your applications in, including the need for closer proximity to your end users and thus to reduce latency, data residence laws, regulatory requirements, the choice of services available, and costs.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Edge locations are AWS infrastructure facilities located across the globe that help cache content for Amazon CloudFront. Any content that is accessed from the origin is cached locally at one or more edge locations closer to users to access that content for a particular <strong class="bold">time to live</strong> (<strong class="bold">TTL</strong>). This way, repeated access to the same content is delivered over a low latency connection.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>AWS Storage Gateway enables you to build hybrid cloud solutions by giving access to the Amazon S3 and Glacier environments from your on-premises network. You install and configure the gateway appliance at your on-premises location and can use any one of four gateway types to access unlimited storage in the cloud. These gateway types are Amazon S3 File Gateway, Amazon FSx File Gateway, Tape Gateway, and Volume Gateway.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>The Developer Support plan gives you access to technical support via email and chats only. This support plan is cheaper than the Business and Enterprise Support plans and is recommended for experimenting with or testing applications on AWS.</p></li>
				<li>A and B<p>Several services are configured from a global perspective on AWS. For example, with IAM, every IAM user in your AWS account is unique across the entire AWS Global Infrastructure. The same applies to Amazon Route53, where domain names configured in host zones have a global presence across all Regions on AWS. Another global service on AWS is Amazon CloudFront.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>One of the six advantages of cloud computing is the ability to <strong class="bold">go global in minutes</strong>. This is made possible because, as an AWS customer, you have access to all Regions and Availability Zones where you can provision the resources required to host your application in a matter of minutes.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon CloudWatch enables you to set up alarms that can be triggered when a particular threshold is crossed. You can set up an alarm for billing alerts that monitors when your total spend crosses a specified dollar amount. This alarm can be configured to send out an alert to an email address that uses the Amazon SNS service.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon EBS is like the virtual hard disks (volumes) that you attach to EC2 instances. They need to be provisioned in the same availability where the EC2 instance has been launched to be attached to that EC2 instance. Furthermore, you cannot attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. You could take a snapshot of the EBS volume and launch a new volume in another Availability Zone from that snapshot if required.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>AWS IAM Password Policies enable you to define custom policies on your AWS account to specify complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for your IAM users' passwords. This ensures that IAM user accounts are created with complex, hard-to-crack passwords.</p></li>
				<li>A<p><strong class="bold">Multi-Factor Authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">MFA</strong>) is a recommended best practice authentication security measure. It requires you to authenticate with a username and password, as well as a security token generated by a physical or virtual device you own. Used together, these factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>An IAM Group can be used to club users who share common job functions. You can then assign the necessary permissions to the IAM Group, which will filter down to the IAM users that are members of the group.</p><p>Where possible, entities that need access to services and resources on AWS ought to be granted access via IAM roles using temporary security credentials. For example, users who need to access resources in another AWS account can be granted permission to assume a role rather than having to create IAM accounts for them in the other account. This is considered best practice and AWS highly recommends this approach.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>An IAM role enables you to grant external users access to resources in your AWS account using temporary credentials that are managed by the AWS <strong class="bold">Security Token Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">STS</strong>). An IAM role will also have an IAM policy attached to it that specifies the exact set of permissions the role will grant to the external user(s).</p></li>
				<li>A<p>AWS Pricing Calculator can help you estimate the monthly costs of the resources you wish to provision on AWS. In addition to specifying the expected usage for the month, to calculate the cost of the resources, you can provide additional details such as the amount of data transferred in and out of the AWS Region and cross-Region to get a complete estimate.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>You can use cost allocation tags to identify your resource costs on your cost allocation report and track your AWS costs by resources and who owns them. AWS provides two types of cost allocation tags: AWS-generated tags and user-defined tags.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>AWS Cost Explorer enables you to view 12 months of usage and spending data, as well as a forecast of what your future costs will be for the next 12 months. Cost Explorer can also provide information on how much of your RI you have utilized, as well as the savings that have been made from using RIs over on-demand options for EC2 Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, and more.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>To access an AWS account as an IAM user, you need to create a set of access keys, which is a combination of an access key ID and a secret access key. Note these keys are considered long-term access keys. One set of keys is associated with a specific IAM user.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>You can create an IAM role with the necessary permissions to upload objects to a specific Amazon S3 bucket. You should then deploy your EC2 instances with this role attached (this involves creating an instance profile associated with the role). The IAM role will enable the application running on the EC2 instance to access the Amazon S3 bucket. Using an IAM role, the EC2 instance will obtain temporary credentials from the <strong class="bold">Security Token Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">STS</strong>).</p></li>
				<li>A<p>AWS Policy Simulator can help you identify which set of policies are allowed and which are denied against specific identities, groups of identities, and IAM roles. You can obtain granular visibility into specific permissions that have been allowed and denied, helping you troubleshoot access issues.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>The IAM Credentials Report enables you to review IAM user accounts created in your AWS account. You can identify if an IAM user has been configured with a username and password, as well as access keys. You can also identify IAM users that may not have accessed resources in your AWS accounts recently, which may indicate that those accounts may not be required anymore. Regularly deleting unwanted IAM user accounts is part of the security best practice.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>Permission boundaries enable you to define the maximum set of permissions that can be granted by an identity-based policy for an IAM user or IAM role.</p></li>
				<li>C<p><strong class="bold">SCPs</strong> is a feature of the AWS Organization service that enables you to set the maximum set of permissions that can be defined for member accounts. You can also set policies to prevent the root users of member accounts from removing the membership to an organization management account once the invitation to become a member account has been accepted.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon S3 Standard-IA can be used to store objects that you are not going to frequently access, but at the same time, you have instant access to the data when you need it.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>You can create a resource policy with a condition statement that allows you to restrict the application of the policy based on a predefined condition, such as the corporate office network IP block.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is ideal if you are unsure of what your object access patterns might be. Objects are automatically transitioned across four different tiers, two of which are latency access tiers, which are designed to move objects between frequently accessed and infrequently accessed tiers, while the other two are optional archive access tiers. For the infrequent access tier, if you do not access your objects for 30 days, then it transitions to the Amazon S3 Standard-IA storage class, which is cheaper. If you need to access the same objects again later, they are transitioned back to the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>To protect against accidental deletions or overwriting, Amazon S3 Versioning can be enabled. This service ensures that if someone tries to perform a delete request on an object without specifying the version ID, it will not be deleted. Instead, a delete marker will be added and the object will be hidden from view. You can then delete this marker to reenable access to the object. You should also consider setting a bucket policy so that not all users can perform delete requests.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon S3 <strong class="bold">CRR</strong> is used to asynchronously copy objects across AWS buckets in different AWS Regions. This feature can be used to fulfill compliance and regulatory requirements, which may require you to store copies of data thousands of kilometers away for <strong class="bold">Disaster Recovery</strong> (<strong class="bold">DR</strong>) purposes.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>With SSE-KMS, you can encrypt your objects in Amazon S3. You can create and manage your <strong class="bold">CMKs</strong>, as well as benefit from the auditing feature, which shows when your CMK was used and by whom. This service integrates with Amazon CloudTrail to offer full auditing features.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>If you need urgent access to just a subset of your archives, you can opt for the Expedited retrieval option. Expedited retrievals are made available within 1 to 5 minutes for archives of up to 250 <strong class="bold">megabytes</strong> (<strong class="bold">MB</strong>).</p></li>
				<li>A<p>S3TA reduces this speed variability that is often experienced due to the architecture of the public internet. S3TA routes your uploads via Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations and AWS backbone networks. This, in turn, gives faster speeds and consistently low latency for your data transfers.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>The Amazon Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device offers a larger storage capacity and is ideal for data migration tasks. With 80 TB of HDD and 1 TB of <strong class="bold">serial advanced technology attachment</strong> (<strong class="bold">SATA</strong>) SDD volumes, you can start moving large volumes of data to the cloud. The device also comes with 40 vCPUs and 80 GB of memory.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon FSx File Gateway enables you to connect your on-premises Windows applications that need large amounts of storage to the cloud-hosted Amazon FSx service for Windows File Server with low latency connectivity. Amazon FSx File Gateway also supports integration with <strong class="bold">Active Directory</strong> (<strong class="bold">AD</strong>) and the ability to configure access controls using <strong class="bold">ACLs</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>NAT gateways help relay outbound requests to the internet on behalf of EC2 instances configured to use them. The NAT gateway replaces the source IPv4 address of your EC2 instances with the private IP address of the NAT gateway, thus acting as a proxy. Response traffic is then redirected by the NAT gateway back to the private IP address of the EC2 instance that made the original request.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Security groups are stateful. This means that even if you have not configured any inbound rules, response traffic to any outbound requests will be permitted inbound by the Security Group. Similarly, if you configured any inbound rules, outbound response traffic to any inbound traffic is permitted, without you having to explicitly create those outbound rules.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>A VPC peering connection is a private network connection between two VPCs. The service allows you to connect multiple VPCs so that instances in one VPC can access resources in another VPC over a private IP address space.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>The problem with VPC peering, when you're configuring multiple VPC to connect, is that every VPC must establish a one-to-one connection with its peer. This can quickly create complex connections that are difficult to manage. Route tables for each VPC also need to be configured for every peering connection.</p><p>AWS Transit Gateway allows you to connect your VPCs via the gateway in a hub-and-spoke model, greatly reducing this complexity as each VPC only needs to connect to the Gateway to access other VPCs.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Direct Connect is a service that enables you to connect your corporate data center to your VPC and the public services offered by AWS, such as Amazon S3, via a dedicated private connection that bypasses the internet altogether. The service enables you to achieve bandwidth connectivity of up to 100 Gbps.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>You can set up a <strong class="bold">VPN</strong> connection between your on-premises network and your VPC. This is a secure encrypted site-to-site tunnel that's established between two endpoints over the public internet. It offers AES 128 or 256-bit <strong class="bold">IPsec</strong> encryption, which means that you can transfer data between the two endpoints securely.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon Route53 can help you create alias records so that when a user types in a corporate domain-friendly name into the browser, it will direct the traffic to an AWS service, such as an ALB, giving access to the web application.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon Route 53 offers domain name registration. You can purchase and manage domain names such as <strong class="source-inline">example.com</strong> and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure the DNS settings for your domains.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>To offer high availability of your web application, you can host two copies of your resources ideally across different Regions. One set of resources will be designated as your primary resource and the other as a secondary resource. If the primary resource is offline, then users' requests are redirected to the secondary resource.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Amazon CloudFront is a <strong class="bold">Content Delivery Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDN</strong>) that helps you distribute your static and dynamic content globally over low latency connections. The service caches content at edge locations closer to where your users are accessing the website.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>To launch an EC2 instance with a custom AMI that you have built in another Region, you need to ensure that you copy the AMI to that Region.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>Accelerated Computing EC2 instance types are designed with hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform complex functions. They are best for processing complex graphics, number crunching, and machine learning.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>A Dedicated Host is a physical host dedicated for your use alone and gives you additional control and management capability over how instances are placed on a physical server. In addition, dedicated hosts can help address certain third-party licensing terms that are based on a per-CPU core/socket basis.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>On-Demand is ideal for users who need the flexibility to consume compute resources when required and without any long-term commitment. They are ideal for test/dev environments or for applications that have short spiky or unpredictable workloads.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>Provisioned IOPS SSDs offering high-performance EBS storage is ideal for critical, I/O-intensive databases and application workloads.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>Using an <strong class="bold">All Upfront</strong> payment option for your RIs means paying for the entire term of the RI upfront at the beginning of the contract. You do not get a monthly/hourly bill and you benefit from the maximum available discount. Furthermore, a 3-year commitment will offer a bigger discount than a 1-year one.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon Lightsail is a VPS solution that comes pre-configured with common application stacks such as WordPress, Drupal, Plesk, LAMP, and your chosen operating system. You choose the size of the server and it comes preconfigured with SSD storage, an IP address, and more. The best part about Lightsail is that you have a fixed monthly fee based on the instance type and the associated operating system and applications that have been deployed.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>The ECS Fargate Launch Type enables you to set up your ECS environment without having to spin up EC2 instances, provision and scale clusters, or patch and update virtual servers yourself. AWS will manage how the ECS tasks are placed on the cluster, scale them as required, and fully manage the entire environment for you.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon Lambda is a serverless offering from AWS that allows you to run code and perform some tasks. Amazon Lambda is known as a <strong class="bold">Function as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">FaaS</strong>) solution that can be used to build an entirely serverless architecture comprised of storage, databases, and network capabilities where you do not manage any underlying servers.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Microsoft Windows-aware applications that need to share files can easily use FSx for Windows File Share, which offers support for the SMB protocol and Windows NTFS, <strong class="bold">AD</strong> integration, and <strong class="bold">Distributed File System</strong> (<strong class="bold">DFS</strong>).</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon EFS can be used by Linux-based EC2 instances as a centralized file storage solution. This is particularly useful when you have applications deployed across multiple EC2 instances that need to share common files. Amazon EFS can also be accessed from on-premises servers over a VPN or Direct Connect service.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>When you launch a server (Windows or Linux), you must configure it to be associated with a key pair. This is an encrypted key where you will be able to use your private key to log in to Linux-based servers or decrypt the Windows administrator password using the AWS Management Console.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>AWS Outposts is ideal when you want to run AWS resources with very low latency connections to your on-premises application or if you require local data processing due to any compliance and regulatory requirements. You can get AWS Outposts delivered to your local on-premises location as a 42U rack and can scale from 1 rack to 96 racks to create pools of compute and storage capacity.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>AWS Batch can be used to run thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS for performing various types of analysis. AWS Batch will set up and provision the necessary compute resources to fulfill your batch requests. There is no need to deploy server clusters as AWS takes care of this for you.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon EKS is designed to help you deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>The primary advantage of using Amazon RDS over installing databases on EC2 is the fact that AWS manages all the compute and storage provisioning, as well as performing all management tasks on the database. This frees you up to focus on your application and the infrastructure components that host the database.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon RDS offers a feature known as Multi-AZ where the primary (master) copy of your database is deployed in one Availability Zone and a secondary (standby) copy is deployed in another Availability Zone. Data is then synchronously replicated from the master copy to the standby copy continuously. If the master copy fails, AWS will promote the standby copy to become the new master and perform a failover.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon offers a <strong class="bold">Database Migration Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DMS</strong>) that can be used to migrate the data from one database to another. This migration can be performed from your on-premises network to the AWS cloud over a VPN connection or a Direct Connect connection. AWS DMS offers support for both homogeneous migrations, such as from MySQL to MySQL or Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogenous migrations between engines such as Oracle to Microsoft SQL Server or Amazon Aurora.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Redshift Spectrum allows you to perform SQL queries against data stored directly on Amazon S3 Buckets. This is particularly useful if, for instance, you store frequently accessed data in Redshift and some infrequently accessed data in Amazon S3.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>Amazon Aurora is an AWS proprietary database that maintains copies of the database placed across a minimum of three Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora is also five times faster than standard MySQL databases and three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases. It also offers self-healing storage capabilities that can scale up to 128 TB per database instance.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>DynamoDB supports both key-value and document data models such as JSON. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database solution that offers a flexible schema and offers single digit millisecond performance at any scale.</p></li>

				<li value="1">B<p>In scenarios where you have a single RDS database instance deployed, your users are likely to experience a brief I/O suspension when your backup process initializes. By configuring your Amazon RDS database with Multi-AZ, the backup is taken from the standby copy of the database instead of the master. This will ensure that users do not experience any brief outages when trying to access the database.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon Elasticache for Redis is designed for complex data types, offers Multi-AZ capabilities, encryption of data, and compliance with FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, as well as high availability and automatic failover options.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Amazon Redshift is AWS's data warehousing solution that is designed for analytics and is optimized for scanning many rows of data for one or multiple columns. Instead of organizing data as rows, Redshift transparently organizes data by columns. You can use standard SQL to query the database and use it with your existing BI tools.</p></li>
				<li>A and B<p>Detailed monitoring and use of Elastic Load Balancers will increase your EC2 instances' costs. This is because Elastic Load Balancers are not part of the free tier and you are charged based on each hour or partial hour that a load balancer is running and the number of <strong class="bold">Load Balancer Capacity Units</strong> (<strong class="bold">LCUs</strong>) used per hour. Furthermore, whereas basic monitoring is offered free of charge, detailed monitoring is a chargeable service.</p></li>
				<li>B<p><strong class="bold">ALBs</strong> are designed to distribute traffic at the application layer (using HTTP and HTTPS). Furthermore, with ALBs, you can have multiple target groups, allowing you to define complex routing rules based on the different application components. You can configure path-based routing, host-based routing, and much more. You can also configure Lambda functions as targets for your load balancer.</p></li>
				<li>A<p><strong class="bold">Network Load Balancers</strong> are designed to operate at the fourth layer of the OSI model and can handle millions of requests per second. Network Load Balancers are designed for load balancing both TCP and UDP traffic and maintaining ultra-low latencies.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Using a load balancer, you can direct incoming traffic to multiple registered EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones within a given Region. This enables you to offer high availability in case any of the EC2 instances fails or even if an entire Availability Zone goes offline.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>You need to configure listeners to specific ports that you will accept incoming traffic on and the ports you will use to forward traffic to the EC2 instances.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>The nodes of an internal load balancer only have private IP addresses and allow communication between the web layer and the internal application layer. The DNS name of an internal load balancer can be publicly resolved to the private IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, internal load balancers can only route requests from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>When configuring your Auto Scaling group, you can define the minimum and maximum size of your group. You can also choose to keep the size of the group to an initial size that does not expand the group size but ensures that you always have the exact number of EC2 instances running.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon Auto Scaling can help you provision new EC2 instances based on CloudWatch metrics that change according to the load on your instances. Similarly, when demand drops, you can configure Auto Scaling to terminate unwanted resources and thus save on costs.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that can offer guidance on AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas. The service quota (service limits) category of Trusted Advisor can notify you if you use more than 80% of a service quota for a specific service. You can then follow recommendations to delete resources or request a quota increase.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>The AWS ALB service provides integration with <strong class="bold">Web Application Firewall</strong> (<strong class="bold">WAF</strong>), which helps protect against common web exploits such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>With the target tracking scaling policy, Auto Scaling will launch or terminate EC2 instances in the fleet based on the target value of a specific metric. The target tracking policy tracks the metric value and attempts to ensure the correct number of EC2 instances are running to meet that target value.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon <strong class="bold">Simple Notification Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SNS</strong>) is a push-based messaging and notification system that can be used to allow one application component to send messages to another application component or directly to end users. So, Amazon SNS can be used to send out alerts when a particular CloudWatch metric crosses a threshold for a period and triggers an alarm.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>The Fanout scenario enables you to publish messages to an SNS topic for parallel asynchronous processing. You send the notifications to supported endpoints such as Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams, Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpoints, and Lambda functions.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon <strong class="bold">SQS</strong> is a fully managed message queuing solution that enables you to decouple your application components into distributed systems and facilitates the design and architecture of microservices. A queueing system such as Amazon SQS can help different components of your application work independently. Queues can hold messages in the form of requests/tasks until capacity is available.</p></li>
				<li>B<p><strong class="bold">FIFO</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">First-In-First-Out</strong> and its queues are designed to preserve the order of your messages, as well as ensure only one-time delivery with no duplicates.</p><p>With FIFO queues, you can get a throughput at a rate of 300 transactions per second. If you use batching, you can get up to 3,000 transactions per second, per API method (<strong class="source-inline">SendMessageBatch</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">ReceiveMessage</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">DeleteMessageBatch</strong>).</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon recommends using Amazon MQ for migrating applications from existing message brokers where compatibility with APIs such as JMS or protocols such as AMQP 0-9-1, AMQP 1.0, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP are required.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Amazon EventBridge is a serverless <em class="italic">event bus service</em> that allows you to stream real-time events from your applications to support targets such as Lambda functions, which can then be triggered to take some form of action. In the preceding example, EventBridge can trigger a Lambda function if someone tries to delete an object in your S3 bucket and some action can be taken in response to the event.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon Step Functions enables you to define these workflows as a series of state machines that contain states that make up the workflow. These states make decisions based on input, perform some action, and produce an output to other states. Step Functions also allow you to integrate human interaction, particularly where manual intervention is required, and can run for up to 1 year.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>You can configure CloudWatch Events with a rule to trigger a Lambda function at a defined schedule. You would need to create the Lambda function and then, in the rule settings for CloudWatch events, specify the Lambda function as a target to be triggered at the designated schedule.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Kinesis Data Analytics lets you query and analyze stream data in real time. You can use standard programming and database query languages such as Java, Python, and SQL to query streaming data as it is being ingested.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that can be used to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. To set up the service, you need to specify the source S3 bucket and define a schema.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon Kinesis Firehose is designed to capture, transform, and deliver streaming data to several AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Redshift in near real time. The service can also batch, compress, transform, and encrypt your data streams, thereby reducing storage usage and increasing security.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon QuickSight is a serverless <strong class="bold">Business Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">BI</strong>) service that can help you build interactive dashboards and embedded visualizations into your applications and web portals.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Amazon EMR is a managed Hadoop framework that allows you to process vast amounts of big data. You can use open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>Amazon CloudFormation is a solution that can help you design, build, and deploy your infrastructure using code. You can create templates that use a declarative approach to instruct CloudFormation to build a precise infrastructure repeatedly, as required, by your testing team. CloudFormation templates can also be configured to accept input parameters for environment-specific configurations and variations required in the build.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management and orchestration service that enables you to provision resources such as servers both in the cloud and on-premises using Chef and Puppet. With OpsWorks, you can define service layers for your application stack such as the database layer, load balancer layer, and more.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon Elastic Beanstalk is a service that enables you to deploy your application without having to manually configure the underlying infrastructure that will support the application. You upload your code in a supported language and environment and AWS will provision the underlying infrastructure, such as the compute, storage, and network components, to support the application. Amazon ElasticBeanstalk will also enable you to specify how the underlying infrastructure components will be deployed – for example, you can specify the EC2 instance type and size that is deployed or enforce that a set minimum number of EC2 instances are deployed as part of an Auto Scaling group.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>In a multi-tier application architecture, backend operations such as application, middleware, or database operations are performed by the worker tier of your Elastic Beanstalk configuration. AWS Elastic Beanstalk will also provision an Amazon SQS queue to facilitate communication between the web services tier and the worker tier.</p></li>
				<li>A and D<p>CloudFormation templates can be written in both JSON and YAML format. These are declarative markup languages that can help CloudFormaton provision infrastructure in your AWS account.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>Memory is a custom metric because memory metrics are at the OS level and cannot be monitored by default. To ingest custom metrics, you need to use the CloudWatch agent or the <strong class="bold">PutMetricData</strong> API action to publish them to CloudWatch.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>You can configure CloudWatch alarms to monitor a given resource metric, such as the average CPU utilization of an EC2 instance. If the metric crosses a specific threshold for a specified period, then the alarm can be triggered to take a certain action. The alarm only triggers if the threshold has been breached for a specified period.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>VPC Flow Logs can capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. You can configure VPC Flow Logs to capture all traffic to the VPC, a specific subnet, or a specific network interface of an EC2 instance.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>AWS CloudTrail stores event history from within the CloudTrail dashboard for every activity that occurs in your AWS account. You can create trails to store specific management events or data events and if you require more than 90 days' worth of event history.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>AWS Config is a service that allows you to gain visibility into how your AWS resources are configured and deployed in your AWS account. This includes configuration information, as well as changes to those configurations over time. You can also use AWS Config to enforce specific configurations rules and ensure that you follow internal guidelines that fulfill compliance requirements.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>AWS Systems Manager's Patch Manager enables you to automatically patch your EC2 instances that are comprised of security and application updates. Note that updates for applications on Windows servers are limited to those released by Microsoft.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>AWS Systems Manager's Parameter Store enables you to provide sensitive information such as passwords and database strings as parameter values. These values can be stored or encrypted, and your application can be configured to securely retrieve these values as they are needed from the Parameter Store.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>The AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager service offers a management console to track all your incidents and notify responders of the impact, identify data that can help with troubleshooting, and help you get services back up and running.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>AWS Trusted Advisor analyzes your resources and how they have been configured and compares those configurations against security practices to identify opportunities to save money, improve system availability and performance, or address security concerns.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>The AWS Trusted Advisor service offers different levels of checks based on the AWS support plan that you have subscribed to. To access the full range of checks across all categories, you must be subscribed to either the Business or Enterprise Support plan. With either of these plans, you can also use Amazon CloudWatch Events to monitor the status of Trusted Advisor checks.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>The Reliability pillar also focuses on how quickly you can recover from failure based on your architectural design. This is because failures are bound to happen and your architecture must be able to recover from these failures swiftly. One key concept that you should also consider is that replacing failed resources is often better than trying to figure out why the failure occurred and then attempting to resolve the issue that caused the failure.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>When architecting solutions for the cloud, you must select the resource types and sizes based on your performance needs, while monitoring your resources consistently to ensure you maintain those levels of performance as per demand. Amazon CloudFront can help you improve performance by reducing the latency associated with accessing large amounts of content across the globe. It does this by caching content locally at edge locations as they are being accessed.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>The Cost Optimization pillar focuses on ensuring that you architect and build solutions in a manner that avoids unnecessary costs. At the same time, you want to be able to ensure that your applications are highly performant, reliable, operationally efficient, and secure. To achieve cost optimization, you should understand your spending patterns and analyze where the money is going.</p></li>
				<li>A<p>Amazon RDS is a managed database service. The customer can provision databases and select the instance type and size to power the database. However, the customer cannot manage the instance itself as this is taken care of by AWS, which includes patching and installing database updates. In contrast, patching EC2 instances is the customer's responsibility as EC2 is not a fully managed service.</p></li>
				<li>C<p>Compliance reports and agreements are available via a portal on AWS known as <strong class="bold">AWS Artifact</strong>. These reports include AWS <strong class="bold">Service Organization Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOC</strong>) reports, <strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI</strong>) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across different Regions.</p></li>
				<li>D<p>As a customer, you need to follow the service policy for penetration testing, which includes permitted services and prohibited activities. Such prohibited activities are <strong class="bold">Denial of Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DoS</strong>), <strong class="bold">DDoS</strong>, simulated DoS, and simulated DDoS.</p></li>
				<li>B<p>With SSE-KMS, you create and manage <strong class="bold">CMKs</strong>, and you use these keys to encrypt data keys and your data. SS3-KMS offers additional features such as auditing capabilities and integrates with CloudTrail.</p></li>
