			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="2251">A brief history of Financial One ACME</st></strong><st c="2288">: Financial One ACME has been a leader in providing software solutions for the financial services market. </st><st c="2395">The company started in the early 2000s with a classical 3-tier application architecture (Windows rich client, application server, and database) that customers installed in their data centers, with new releases of their software shipping twice </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2638">a year.</st></span><p class="list-inset"><st c="2645">Over the years, the Windows rich client was slowly replaced with a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2713">web client.</st></span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="2724">Providing a self-hosted SaaS and on-premises offering</st></strong><st c="2778">: In 2015, the demand for a SaaS-hosted version increased. </st><st c="2838">Instead of re-architecting the product to support multi-tenancy for a SaaS-based solution, the decision was made to simply host the Application Server and Database for each SaaS Customer separately in the existing Financial One ACME data center. </st><st c="3084">This solved concerns about data residency and data access. </st><st c="3143">However, it meant that with a growing number of SaaS-based customers, the operational overhead grew as each customer (=tenant) had a production deployment on their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3307">separate VMs.</st></span><p class="list-inset"><st c="3320">Additionally, IT operations had the challenge of continuously expanding data center capacity for production</st><a id="_idIndexMarker218"/><st c="3428"> environments to keep up with business growth. </st><st c="3475">Due to different customer sizes, they also had to do individual capacity planning for each tenant to properly size and not </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3598">oversize environments.</st></span></p><p class="list-inset"><st c="3620">Development teams, on the other hand, owned the pre-production environments. </st><st c="3698">This included everything from the development workstations, build servers, and pre-production testing and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3804">staging environments.</st></span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3825">Moving to monthly releases</st></strong><st c="3852">: From 2015 to 2020, the release cadency was constantly improved, leading to a monthly release cycle. </st><st c="3955">Those releases were built and tested by the development teams and then provided to IT operations to deploy into SaaS, as well as to those customers that still ran the software on-premises. </st><st c="4144">This change in speed resulted in a situation where not every customer wanted to update their software that frequently as it had to be aligned with their internal change request processes. </st><st c="4332">Some customers were up to six releases behind the current build, which put an extra strain on the development team to support all those </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4468">older versions.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4483">The lift and shift to the cloud</st></strong><st c="4515">: In 2020, the business expanded into new regions, and with that, the requirement grew to offer the SaaS offering in new regions. </st><st c="4646">Instead of building more data centers, the company decided to </st><em class="italic"><st c="4708">lift and shift</st></em><st c="4722"> their existing production architecture into the public cloud vendors’ </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4793">compute offerings.</st></span><p class="list-inset"><st c="4811">This move also included new processes and guidelines on how to update software or access data on those cloud servers – for example, how to access logs from server X that belong to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4992">Tenant Y!</st></span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5001">Outperformed by new FinTech companies</st></strong><st c="5039">: During the pandemic, new FinTech software companies emerged that were </st><em class="italic"><st c="5112">born and architected for the cloud</st></em><st c="5146">! This put pressure on Financial One ACME as those new SaaS-only companies didn’t have to maintain a legacy architecture to support both SaaS and on-premises. </st><st c="5305">Their architectures were also multi-tenant and multi-cloud, which allowed them to run more cost-efficiently than the Financial One ACME </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5441">counterpart offering.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="5462">Leadership made a </st><a id="_idIndexMarker219"/><st c="5481">strategic decision to re-architect their offering while also improving the efficiency of developing, supporting, and operating the existing platform until every customer could be migrated over to the future </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5688">SaaS-only offering.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="5707">And here we are: it’s 2024, so it’s time to think about how to help this organization modernize and re-invent themselves. </st><st c="5830">Kubernetes and cloud native are the future tech stack! </st><st c="5885">The hope lies in platform engineering to improve the work of engineers that work on the future stack as well as maintain the old stack. </st><st c="6021">This is where we come in – the newly formed platform </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6074">engineering team!</st></span></p>

				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="6721">Technical docs</st></strong><st c="6736">: The team who’s preparing end-user-facing documentation to accompany every release, along with release notes, new features, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6866">how-to guides</st></span></li>

			<p><st c="7567">So, how can this happen? </st><st c="7593">The reason why many platform engineering initiatives fail is the same reason why other product development initiatives have failed: somebody had a great idea – built or made somebody build a product – but ended up finding nobody that saw the benefit of this new product as it didn’t solve any real problem </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7899">people have.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7911">The mistake many make is to not validate the initial idea with their potential end users that they think would benefit from that solution. </st><st c="8051">If you don’t find a critical mass of users that have a problem that’s solved by a new product, then it’s better to not build a product at all as it’s bound to fail from </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8220">the start.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8230">If you’ve done any product management in the past, you’re probably thinking, “</st><em class="italic"><st c="8309">But this is Product Management 101</st></em><st c="8344">!” Fully agreed! </st><st c="8361">However, not every team that’s tasked with building a new platform has previous experience in product management. </st><st c="8475">Many teams that we’ve seen happen to find themselves in a situation where they can start building a platform without seeing the parallels to building any regular product. </st><st c="8646">Many tasks go with building a product before even starting to build </st><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="8714">the pr</st><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/><st c="8720">oduct</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="8726">.</st></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic"><st c="8937">Identify</st></em><st c="8946"> a problem that a large enough user </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8982">base has</st></span></li>

			</ul>
			<p><st c="9190">To answer those questions and go a step beyond the basics, we suggest talking with your potential end users. </st><st c="9300">Let them tell you about the actual problem they have and give them the freedom to explain a solution that gets them to the ideal way of getting their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9450">work done.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9460">As you listen, make sure you aren’t constraining yourself with any technical limitations or challenges you’re aware of right now. </st><st c="9591">There’s a famous quote attributed to </st><em class="italic"><st c="9628">Henry Ford</st></em><st c="9638"> who allegedly said, “</st><em class="italic"><st c="9660">If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.</st></em><st c="9736">” You’ll learn that your users typically easily describe the problem they have. </st><st c="9817">However,  the solution they often come up with is constrained by what they think is possible or by the technical limitations they’re currently </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9959">aware of.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9968">Now, we aren’t going to start by coming up with a revolutionary new way for software engineering that takes months or years. </st><st c="10094">However, this mindset is important as it’s a step toward solving problems that others have failed to solve in a way that the solution is </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10231">widely adopted!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="10246">To start, let’s think about how to </st><em class="italic"><st c="10282">solve this problem</st></em><st c="10300"> with the </st><em class="italic"><st c="10310">simplest and fastest</st></em><st c="10330"> technical solution. </st><em class="italic"><st c="10351">Don’t over-engineer</st></em><st c="10370"> from the start to come up with the best or most revolutionary technical implementation. </st><st c="10459">While this should be an inspiring goal, our initial goal is to get </st><em class="italic"><st c="10526">fast feedback and validation</st></em><st c="10554"> on whether our proposed implementation solves the pain of our potential </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10627">end users.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="13674">When </st><a id="_idIndexMarker230"/><st c="13680">problems are detected in production, analyzing the problem is a completely different story! </st><st c="13772">The development teams must ask IT ops for permission to get access to the logs by opening up a Jira ticket. </st><st c="13880">That sometimes takes hours as the IT ops team is typically overwhelmed with many other tasks. </st><st c="13974">The IT ops team also doesn’t have the inside knowledge about where the software is writing all the logs to and the development teams don’t always provide this information in the initial ticket either. </st><st c="14175">That’s why it often takes several iterations to capture the desired logs and upload them to the IT-ops-owned tool to share production-relevant data with other teams. </st><st c="14341">Changing log levels is also not that easy. </st><st c="14384">Production changes like this have to follow a special change approval process. </st><st c="14463">As its a software change, it’s handled by the DevOps team, which slows things down </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14546">even further!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="14559">For the development teams, this means that instead of just remoting into a server to access and analyze the logs on the spot, those logs have to be analyzed through the IT ops central production data storage tool. </st><st c="14774">However, the development team isn’t super familiar with this as they don’t work with it regularly. </st><st c="14873">That centralized tool also has its own permission system that was initially set up to prevent unauthorized access to restricted data. </st><st c="15007">As that system isn’t integrated with the same authentication and access control system developers use, it’s often out of sync with the current team assignment. </st><st c="15167">This is leading to situations where individual engineers in a team can’t access the logs they need, leading to additional cycles with IT ops and DevOps or using a non-approved shortcut by simply asking a dev colleague who happened to have access to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="15416">the logs!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="15425">As you can see, there’s lots of frustration and pain in the development team. </st><st c="15504">But as you can also imagine, there’s also lots of frustration on the IT ops and DevOps teams. </st><st c="15598">Their job of operating production is constantly interrupted with tasks to look up and provide access to data from production or approve a log-level change. </st><st c="15754">There’s constantly a lot of back and forth to understand what data is requested, where to find that data, and who should have access to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="15890">this data.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="15900">Lots of conversations typically go into understanding the full picture, understanding the pain points on both sides, and having enough details to start thinking about a better way of doing this. </st><st c="16096">When you apply this in your organization, plan enough time and notify people you want to talk to ahead of time so that they can gather their thoughts to have </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="16254">those conversations!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="16274">To start proposing a solution, it’s best to get an organized overview of the pain points of all sides, as shown </st><a id="_idIndexMarker231"/><st c="16387">in the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="16394">following table:</st></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="24297">Service details</st></strong><st c="24313">: Name, version, to which component </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="24350">it belongs</st></span></li>

			</ul>
			<p><st c="24499">In this Kubernetes example, you can also see how we can pass some of this information in already standardized annotations such as </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="24630">app.kubernetes.io/name</st></strong><st c="24652">, </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="24654">part-of</st></strong><st c="24661">, and </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="24667">version</st></strong><st c="24674">.

			<p><st c="24888">Getting early feedback on this proposed configuration file format can happen before any actual implementation is done. </st><st c="25008">It gives development, DevOps, and IT ops the chance to come up with additional metadata they want, such as the </st><em class="italic"><st c="25119">priority</st></em><st c="25127"> of the service. </st><st c="25144">This could be used to define the escalation process when problem alerts occur in production, or a fallback email address to send email updates to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="25290">the team.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="25299">The heart of our proposed solution is not the configuration file but the automation process that can react to requests from developers but can also be triggered from an alert. </st><st c="25476">The easiest solution would be a simple service that exposes a REST endpoint to be triggered for both use cases. </st><st c="25588">That service needs to run in an environment where it has access to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="25655">the following:</st></span></p>

			</ul>
			<p><st c="25842">To start </st><a id="_idIndexMarker244"/><st c="25852">with a minimum viable prototype, we can define that we only support K8s, only support the production log solution, and only support a single notification tool, such as Slack. </st><st c="26027">This allows us to prove the value through the prototype with the option to extend it to other config data sources, additional log environments, and a longer list of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="26192">notification tools.</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="30930">The artifact life cycle experiment – from idea, to git commit, to prod!</st></h3>
			<p><st c="31002">A simple approach to learning the end-to-end process is doing a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="31067">little experiment.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="31085">As a kid, I’m </st><a id="_idIndexMarker251"/><st c="31100">you were as fascinated by rivers (small or large) as I was. </st><st c="31160">I’m sure you’ve dropped a piece of wood or a small branch of a tree into the water and then observed it as the water carried it away. </st><st c="31294">You probably ran along the river to watch that branch making its way to its final life cycle step: the ocean! </st><st c="31404">Because that’s where all water streams eventually end up. </st><st c="31462">As kids, we didn’t have the chance to follow that branch to the ocean. </st><st c="31533">However, as engineers, we do have the chance to follow the full life cycle of an artifact: from the inception of the idea (a ticket in a requirements engineering tool) to its first git commit by a developer until the artifact gets deployed to, updated, or replaced </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="31798">in production.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="31812">We have two options to understand that artifact life cycle. </st><st c="31873">First, we can pick an existing service or feature and do some forensics by analyzing all tickets, git commits, pipeline runs, test reports, emails, change requests, and incident reports, and with that learn the processes, tools, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="32106">people involved!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="32122">Another approach is to ask one of the development teams to create a “demo” or “non-impacting” feature. </st><st c="32226">With the popularity of feature flagging, this could be a simple feature behind a flag that changes a small runtime aspect of the artifact. </st><st c="32365">The benefit of this is that it imposes no risk in production but it allows us to learn everything there is to learn about the current SDLC and with that derive the current artifact life cycle in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="32560">that organiz</st><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/><st c="32572">ation!</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="45384">Before </st><a id="_idIndexMarker269"/><st c="45392">answering the infrastructure-impacting questions, let’s answer the fundamental </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="45471">ownership question:</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="45490">We own the platform!</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="45511">The platform engineering team owns the platform as a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="45565">product end-to-end!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="45584">As our platform will provide capabilities to make delivering and operating software components easier, our top goal must be to follow our own best practices and ideally deploy the platform with the same golden paths and self-service capabilities we want our end users to use. </st><st c="45861">Some organizations call this </st><em class="italic"><st c="45890">being customer zero</st></em><st c="45909"> or </st><em class="italic"><st c="45913">drink your own champagne</st></em><st c="45937">. If we don’t follow that mantra and just build something, throw it over the wall, and hope somebody else operates it, we miss the whole point of having a modern product mindset for </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="46119">platform engineering.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="46140">We need to feel the same pain of software delivery and operations that our users currently feel. </st><st c="46238">This will be even more motivation for us to build platform capabilities that make our lives as software </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="46342">teams easier.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="46355">We need to avoid an </st><em class="italic"><st c="46376">ivory tower approach</st></em><st c="46396"> where we’re forcing best practices from the top down without following those best practices ourselves. </st><st c="46500">If we do this, we may end up with a famous Reddit posting, similar to the one mentioned at the beginning of this chapter: “</st><em class="italic"><st c="46623">We spent months building this platform. </st><st c="46664">Devs hate it! </st><st c="46678">Help me </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="46686">understand why!</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="46701">”</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="46703">Now, let’s go back and answer some of those infrastructure questions that were raised earlier that may influence our </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="46820">architectural decisio</st><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/><st c="46841">ns.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/><st c="46845">Organizational constraints – existing infrastructure requirements?</st></h2>
			<p><st c="46912">We need to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker270"/><st c="46924">find out whether there are constraints on using existing infrastructure services. </st><st c="47006">When it comes to enterprises, contracts with infrastructure or cloud providers will likely exist. </st><st c="47104">If such constraints exist, it will play a role in our decisions – for example, do we need to run and operate our own K8s cluster on-premises or can we leverage a managed service from a vendor? </st><st c="47297">If we’re constrained to a certain cloud vendor, this also means we’re potentially constrained to use their service offerings (storage, database, caches, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="47450">and more).</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="47460">Regarding that area, we also want to look into access control, ingress and egress, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="47548">cost constraints!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="47565">It’s important to know about all such organizational constraints before finalizing the decisions on infrastructure </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="47681">and architect</st><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/><st c="47694">ure!</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/><st c="47699">Connectivity constraints – interoperability requirements?</st></h2>
			<p><st c="47757">Our platform </st><a id="_idIndexMarker271"/><st c="47771">capabilities will require us to connect to and interact with other existing systems. </st><st c="47856">That ranges from having access to SSO, your Git repository, CI/CD pipelines, observability, orchestration layers, cloud APIs, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="47982">and more.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="47991">Depending on where the platform will run – that is, on-premises versus the cloud – this will have an impact on how the platform can connect with all those tools or how those tools can connect back to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="48192">the platform.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="48205">We need to think about firewalls, pull versus push connectivity, and API rate limits and costs as we need to ensure resilient interoperability between all </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="48361">those systems.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="48375">It’s important to know all those connectivity constraints before finalizing the decisions on the infrastructure and location where our platform resides regarding all other systems we need to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="48567">connec</st><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/><st c="48573">t to.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/><st c="48579">Resiliency constraints – SLAs and other non-functional requirements?</st></h2>
			<p><st c="48648">The</st><a id="_idIndexMarker272"/><st c="48652"> goal of our platform is to improve day-to-day work for a variety of internal users (developers, DevOps, IT ops, quality engineers, app support, and more). </st><st c="48808">This means that our platform needs to be available and working every time our users need it. </st><st c="48901">In global enterprises, this could mean operational resiliency and high availability 24/7. </st><st c="48991">If the platform isn’t available, our engineers can’t do their critical work, such as releasing a new version of a piece of software, patching a security issue, or scaling their workloads to handle increased end </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="49202">user demand!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="49214">So, we need to understand the non-functional requirements on our platform, such as </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="49298">the following:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="49312">Availability – for example, 9 A.M. </st><st c="49348">to 5 P.M. </st><st c="49358">in a single time zone or Monday to Friday across all </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="49411">time zones</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="49421">User experience – for example, the acceptable end user performance of a system must be guaranteed, with up to 100 concurrent engineers using the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="49567">platform capabilities</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="49588">Those non-functional requirements also mean we need to think about how we scale up and down, as well as scale out and in. </st><st c="49711">We need to define whether we provide our platform centrally so that it serves all geographies around the globe or whether we need to deploy the platform components across the different regions to better fulfill the user experience requirements on </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="49958">acceptable performance.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="49981">Dynamic, horizontal, or vertical scaling is a topic that we’ll look at in more detail later in this book when we dive into architecting the platform’s core with Kubernetes as a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="50159">unified layer.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="50173">Now that we have answers to all those questions, we’ll be able to make better-informed decisions about infrastructure and architectural choices for our platform and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="50339">its capabil</st><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/><st c="50350">ities!</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/><st c="50357">Exploring multi-cloud, multi-SaaS, and the fragmentation of capabilities</st></h1>
			<p><st c="50430">When we look into the fragmentation of capabilities and how that interoperates with the platform as a service and its scalability, one thing comes to our mind as a critical function that may not be the most obvious at first: the </st><em class="italic"><st c="50660">IDP should be multi-tenant, not </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="50692">just multi-</st><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/><st c="50703">user</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="50708">.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/><st c="50709">Multi-tenancy and ownership as a capability of our platform</st></h2>
			<p><st c="50769">Multi-tenancy is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker273"/><st c="50786"> usually thought of in the context of a production application. </st><st c="50850">For example, our platform client Financial One ACME is looking to turn their single-tenant product into a multi-tenant product. </st><st c="50978">This will help them achieve higher profit margins, give them less operational overhead, and a slew of other business wins. </st><st c="51101">The same data separation that exists within a production application in a highly regulated industry should exist at every level of that application life cycle, including the IDP. </st><st c="51280">This is not only best practice but may be necessary to gain certain security and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="51361">compliance certifications.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="51387">Since production data can make its way into tests, ensuring that the default access level of every user on the platform is as restrictive as possible by default helps to ensure that should data end up somewhere undesired, the surface level of exposure for that data is as minimal as possible. </st><st c="51681">Additionally, the full isolation of multi-tenancy ensures that secrets that each team may need are isolated from each other, further mitigating any </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="51829">risk surfaces.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="51843">We’ll explore the benefits of security and multi-tenancy in the platform further in </st><a href="B31164_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor381"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="51928">Chapter 7</st></em></span></a><st c="51937">. However, it’s important to note that multi-tenancy can also help reduce the cognitive load of the platform’s users. </st><st c="52055">We’ll cover how more fully in </st><a href="B31164_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor341"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="52085">Chapter 6</st></em></span></a><st c="52094">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="52096">Building for Developers and </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="52124">their Self-Service</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="52142">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="52143">Multi-tenancy also means that any architectural decision we make – any tools we include in our platform – also support multi-tenancy. </st><st c="52278">Take observability as an example – if we capture logs, metrics, traces, and events for the core platform, as well as the applications our users are deploying, we need to make sure that this observability data can be “separated” into its individual tenants. </st><st c="52535">We’ve already discussed that our platform must include ownership as metadata when deploying our core platform, as well as when we provide templates for self-service onboarding of new apps. </st><st c="52724">Let’s consider an example deployment definition enriched with ownership metadata, as discussed in the </st><em class="italic"><st c="52826">Overcoming platform complexity</st></em><st c="52856"> section. </st><st c="52866">That ownership metadata</st><a id="_idIndexMarker274"/><st c="52889"> can be used to enforce access control to any data captured for that deployment, including using it for filters when querying for your metrics </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="53032">or traces:</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="55380">For competitive or regulatory reasons, it’s also possible that some cloud or SaaS vendors can’t be used at all. </st><st c="55493">Why is that? </st><st c="55506">Well, if a potential customer of Financial One ACME considers one of those cloud vendors as a competitor or if one vendor doesn’t meet some regulatory requirement, they wouldn’t be able to purchase our </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="55708">software services.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="55726">This sounds </st><a id="_idIndexMarker278"/><st c="55739">like a lot of constraints leaving us with not much choice, doesn’t it? </st><st c="55810">Fortunately, there are solutions to solve that problem: in the coming chapters, we’ll talk a lot about Kubernetes as the underlying abstraction layer. </st><st c="55961">Building on top of this abstraction layer will make it easier – but not hassle-free – for us to move workloads to different regions and different </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56107">cloud vendors.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="56121">As our platform and all of its components will not exclusively run on Kubernetes but also include other services, it’s important to create a thorough checklist to avoid any architectural decisions that will be hard to change in the future. </st><st c="56362">For example, if our platform has requirements for a document store service, we can either decide to run and operate a document database such as MongoDB on Kubernetes or pick an existing SaaS offering from one of the cloud vendors. </st><st c="56593">Picking a managed service will reduce the effort on our end, but we need to make sure that each potential SaaS vendor that supports a document store service provides the same interface, similar performance characteristics, and similar cost structure. </st><st c="56844">If we make the wrong architectural decision, it might be difficult to do </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56917">the following:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="56931">Change our implementation so that it supports a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56980">different API</st></span></li>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/><st c="57112">Centralized and decentralized platform capabilities</st></h2>
			<p><st c="57164">In the </st><a id="_idIndexMarker279"/><st c="57172">following chapters, we’ll provide more examples of</st><a id="_idIndexMarker280"/><st c="57222"> running our IDP and its components either as a central service, per environment, per region, or even per tenant (if that is a requirement). </st><st c="57363">Your findings about organizational requirements will impact those decisions, such as whether our customers demand that they run in certain regions or aren’t allowed to use a certain </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="57545">cloud vendor.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="57558">Centralizing components has the big advantage of them being easier to manage. </st><st c="57637">Think about a </st><a id="_idIndexMarker281"/><st c="57651">central </st><strong class="bold"><st c="57659">continuous integration</st></strong><st c="57681"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="57683">CI</st></strong><st c="57685">) system such as Jenkins or GitLab that runs pipelines triggered by pull requests to build new artifacts. </st><st c="57792">A central instance of such a CI system is easier to operate, observe, secure, and manage. </st><st c="57882">On the flip side, it means that all our users share the same system, which can easily lead to bottlenecks. </st><st c="57989">The central system also needs to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker282"/><st c="58022">have access to all target environments, which may reside in different geographical </st><a id="_idIndexMarker283"/><st c="58105">regions or even other cloud providers. </st><st c="58144">The number of dependencies to those cloud environments increases with every new team that onboards their application or with every new customer of Financial One ACME that demands our software to be </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="58342">deployed specially!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="58361">Decentralizing components have the advantage of being able to automatically encapsulate the data capture, storage, and access processes. </st><st c="58499">These components are only used by those teams in those regions or environments, which limits the potential of patterns such as noisy neighbors, something we’ll discuss in more detail in </st><a href="B31164_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor341"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="58685">Chapter 6</st></em></span></a><st c="58694">. The drawback of a decentralized approach is that it’s harder to operate, observe, secure, and manage those components as the number of components will grow with every new environment. </st><st c="58880">Automation can help here, but we can’t downplay the additional level of complexity. </st><st c="58964">Just think about whether a vulnerability is found in our CI system. </st><st c="59032">Instead of patching it once in a central system, we need to patch every single instance across all our </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="59135">decentralized services!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="59158">Now that we’ve learned that multi-X – which includes multi-tenancy, cloud, and SaaS – will have an impact on our architectural decisions, it’s important to find a good balance between the effort, benefit, and external requirements we have on our platform. </st><st c="59415">All the knowledge we’ve gained so far allows us to come up with a good reference architecture for our platform, something we’ll discuss in the last part of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="59571">this </st><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/><st c="59576">chapter!</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="61192">Let’s walk through this diagram as you would when presenting it to your peers or end users. </st><st c="61285">We’ll start from the top down before we look into the aspects of observability, availability, resilience, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="61391">and </st><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/><st c="61395">security.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/><st c="61404">The purpose – self-service for your end users</st></h2>
			<p><st c="61450">In </st><a href="B31164_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="61454">Chapter 2</st></em></span></a><st c="61463">, we gave </st><a id="_idIndexMarker286"/><st c="61473">an example of a platform principle that we called </st><em class="italic"><st c="61523">self-service first</st></em><st c="61541">. We provided a detailed description stating, “</st><em class="italic"><st c="61588">We will provide our customers with every platform capability as a self-service, focusing on their user experience and enabling self-determined </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="61732">software development.</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="61753">”</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="61755">This is exactly what’s reflected at the top of the preceding diagram. </st><st c="61825">Here, we listed all of the potential end users we learned about. </st><st c="61890">For Financial One ACME, we have our development teams supporting them with use cases around easier onboarding of new applications or getting easier access to log files from the legacy systems in production. </st><st c="62097">We also provide self-service for the DevOps, security, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="62152">site reliability engineering</st></strong><st c="62180"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="62182">SRE</st></strong><st c="62185">), and</st><a id="_idIndexMarker287"/><st c="62192"> application support teams by reducing the manual work and cognitive load through </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="62274">self-service capabilities.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="62300">There is only so much space on a high-level diagram like this. </st><st c="62364">We could add examples for the different end user self-service features as text or – if needed – provide a more detailed version of this diagram for every end user and their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="62537">self-servic</st><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/><st c="62548">e features!</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/><st c="62560">User interface/dev experience</st></h2>
			<p><st c="62590">Every end user</st><a id="_idIndexMarker288"/><st c="62605"> group is different. </st><st c="62626">Even within end user groups we may have different skill sets that need to be considered when designing and implementing the user interface for our platform’s </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="62784">self-service capabilities.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="62810">Development teams most likely prefer to stay in their preferred IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. </st><st c="62920">They’re probably OK to edit YAML files to enable new self-service capabilities. </st><st c="63000">Some may expect an IDE extension that will bootstrap the creation of those YAML files or an extension that provides code completion and schema validation to reduce the chances of making a mistake such as </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="63204">a typo.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="63211">On the other hand, other teams within the same organization might want a nice developer portal UI – something such as Backstage, which provides nice templating features for creating </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="63394">new components.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="63409">Then, you will have your automation engineers, who neither live in an IDE nor want to click through a wizard to create a new project. </st><st c="63544">They want an API or a CLI they can use to automate tasks as this is the way they’re used to working. </st><st c="63645">They probably expect some Python libraries to call our </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="63700">self-service capabilities.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="63726">As discussed </st><a id="_idIndexMarker289"/><st c="63740">earlier in this chapter, every user has different skills and therefore also different expectations of what a good user experience looks like. </st><st c="63882">Focusing on a good user experience is key as this will be a deciding factor on whether the platform will be adopted or not. </st><st c="64006">This is why it’s important to highlight the user interface and how it may look in our reference architecture as this is the way our users will interact with </st><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/><span class="No-Break"><st c="64163">our platform!</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/><st c="64176">Core platform components</st></h2>
			<p><st c="64201">While we all </st><a id="_idIndexMarker290"/><st c="64215">have our preferences for picking tools and technology, the right approach to picking your core platform components should not be by personal preference. </st><st c="64368">It must be based on what self-service use cases (that is, features of our platform) we want to deliver through a user interface that delivers a good user and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="64526">developer experience.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="64547">In the preceding diagram, we subcategorized the platform components into the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="64625">following areas:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="64641">Delivery services</st></strong><st c="64659">: Those </st><a id="_idIndexMarker291"/><st c="64668">are tools and services that focus on software delivery as this is going to be a primary use case of our platform. </st><st c="64782">CNCF open source tools such as Backstage, ArgoCD, Flux, and OpenFeature, open source tools such as GitLab, Jenkins, and K6, or even commercial tools such as the tools from Atlassian would fall into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="64980">this category.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="64994">Platform services</st></strong><st c="65012">: As a </st><a id="_idIndexMarker292"/><st c="65020">key use case will be around delivering and operating software components, our platform should also provide core platform services that those software components need. </st><st c="65187">That could include services such as caching or databases (Redis, MongoDB, or Postgres), messaging and eventing (Apache Kafka or RabbitMB), service mesh (Istio, Linkerd, or Nginx), and core services such as secrets management, container registries, policy agents, auto-scalers </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="65463">and more.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="65472">Platform</st></strong><st c="65481">: While the platform doesn’t need to run on Kubernetes, in the remainder of this book, we will focus on K8s as the underlying platform orchestration layer. </st><st c="65638">However, Kubernetes must not be the answer to all platform engineering questions. </st><st c="65720">The goal is to pick the right platform components to provide the self-service your end users require. </st><st c="65822">This may lead you to run your platform on VMs or even pick a fully managed out-of-the-box </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="65912">SaaS solution!</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="65926">X-as-Code</st></strong><st c="65936">: Besides </st><em class="italic"><st c="65947">self-service first</st></em><st c="65965">, we must also embrace an </st><em class="italic"><st c="65991">Everything as Code</st></em><st c="66009"> mantra. </st><st c="66018">Whether</st><a id="_idIndexMarker293"/><st c="66025"> it’s defining deployments, observability, or ownership, as </st><a id="_idIndexMarker294"/><st c="66085">discussed earlier in this chapter, or any other software life cycle aspect, everything should be expressed in some type of code. </st><st c="66214">This is where you want to pick tools such as Crossplane, Terraform, or Ansible. </st><st c="66294">Crossplane in particular is emerging in the cloud-native space as a tool of choice when it comes to orchestrating applications and infrastructure in a declarative way. </st><st c="66462">Also, make sure to validate your tool choices for delivery and platform services based on how </st><em class="italic"><st c="66556">X-as-Code</st></em><st c="66565">-friendly they are, such as how they </st><a id="_idIndexMarker295"/><st c="66603">define </st><strong class="bold"><st c="66610">service-level objectives</st></strong><st c="66634"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="66636">SLOs</st></strong><st c="66640">) or monitoring alerts with the selected </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="66682">observability tool!</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="66701">Observability</st></strong><st c="66715">: You wouldn’t drive</st><a id="_idIndexMarker296"/><st c="66736"> a car or fly a plane without any telemetry and your key indicators such as speed, altitude, or fuel gauge. </st><st c="66844">We must also not operate any platform without observability built-in. </st><st c="66914">Thanks to standards </st><a id="_idIndexMarker297"/><st c="66934">such as OpenTelemetry and projects such as Prometheus and Fluent, we have a lot of built-in observability signals in the components that we’ll be using in our platform. </st><st c="67103">Whether it’s Kubernetes itself or tools such as Nginx, Reddis, Harbour, ArgoCD, or Backstage, all those tools emit metrics, logs, events, and/or traces that we can collect and send to our observability backend for automated analysis or alerting! </st><st c="67349">While lots are already built in, not every tool we choose will likely provide all the data we need out of the box. </st><st c="67464">Therefore, it’s important to validate your tool choices based on their state of observability. </st><st c="67559">For some tools, you may need to extract metrics from logs. </st><st c="67618">For others, you may need an extension – for example, Jenkins provides an OpenTelemetry plugin to emit traces for each Jenkins Job execution. </st><st c="67759">In other cases, you may need to rely on commercial observability offerings through </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="67842">agent-based instrumentation.</st></span><p class="list-inset"><st c="67870">Observability will be covered more later in this book as it’s the enabler for many disciplines, such as SRE, auto-scaling, incident response,</st><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/> <span class="No-Break"><st c="68012">and troubleshooting.</st></span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/><st c="68033">A platform that’s available, resilient, and secure</st></h2>
			<p><st c="68084">A platform is a product! </st><st c="68110">So, a product that we want to be used by our internal users has to be available when they need it, resilient when a lot of users need it at the same time, and secure to ensure our users trust </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="68302">the product.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="68314">To ensure that our platform is always there when our users need it, we need to apply the same architectural principles that we would apply to any type of software product that we want to become successful. </st><st c="68521">For our platform, this means that all critical components of the platform also need to be available, resilient, and secure by default. </st><st c="68656">Let’s have a look at some examples and best practices for</st><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/><st c="68713"> these </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="68720">three pillars.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="68734">Availability</st></h3>
			<p><st c="68747">Our users </st><a id="_idIndexMarker298"/><st c="68758">consider our platform available when they can use it for the self-service use cases we promised it would deliver. </st><st c="68872">Remember our proposed </st><em class="italic"><st c="68894">Request a log from production self-service</st></em><st c="68936"> use case from </st><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="68951">Figure 3</st></em></span><em class="italic"><st c="68959">.2</st></em><st c="68961">? If a development team follows that self-service use case, they expect that our platform will deliver the requested logs in a reasonable amount of time at any time, whether it’s Tuesday at noon or Friday at </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="69169">11 P.M.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="69176">That use case involves a lot of different tools, such as Git (where the config as code files are stored) and our homegrown solution, which offers a REST API to request specific logs. </st><st c="69360">Both systems need to be available. </st><st c="69395">Both systems also need to respond to requests in a specified amount of time with a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="69478">valid response.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="69493">The best way to ensure availability is by following </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="69546">two steps:</st></span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="69556">End-to-end use case monitoring</st></strong><st c="69587">: As we would do for business-critical applications, we can set up synthetic tests to simulate the end-to-end user journey for that use case. </st><st c="69730">In this case, we would validate that calls to the Git API work as expected by executing dummy commits and PRs and validating the response time and response code. </st><st c="69892">We would also do the same for our REST API call to request the logs. </st><st c="69961">However, this scenario also needs to wait until the requested logs are sent back to the development team’s communication channel so that we can measure the full </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="70122">end-two-end time.</st></span><p class="list-inset"><st c="70139">Both scenarios can be done through custom scripting, which we run as a cron job, or we can leverage </st><a id="_idIndexMarker299"/><st c="70240">existing synthetic testing solutions. </st><st c="70278">You should validate whether your observability platform already provides synthetic tests as many of those vendors have this feature in their portfolio. </st><st c="70430">This will also make it easier for our second step, which is monitoring and alerting on key </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="70521">quality indicators!</st></span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="70540">Monitor and alert on key availability indicators</st></strong><st c="70589">: As the platform team, we want to be notified if our platform self-service use cases are no longer working as expected before our end users start complaining. </st><st c="70750">This is where monitoring and alerting on key indicators come in. </st><st c="70815">Our synthetic tests already provide a good indicator, but we should set up automated alerting in case the Git API or our REST API starts to slow down or start responding to errors. </st><st c="70996">On top of that, we can also alert on other leading indicators. </st><st c="71059">Many tools in our platform – including Git, from our example – will produce logs as well as health indicator metrics. </st><st c="71177">We want to be notified in case we see </st><em class="italic"><st c="71215">ANY ERROR</st></em><st c="71224"> logs on those systems. </st><st c="71248">They can be early warning indicators. </st><st c="71286">Most systems also have internal queues, such as request queues. </st><st c="71350">We want to be notified if those queues keep growing since this is an indicator that too many incoming requests are piling up, which will eventually lead to performance and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="71522">availability problems.</st></span></li>
			</ol>
			<p><st c="71544">There are many other things we have to do to ensure systems stay available. </st><st c="71621">We’ll discuss those in the next section, where we’ll</st><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/><st c="71673"> talk </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="71679">about resiliency.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="71707">We just</st><a id="_idIndexMarker300"/><st c="71715"> talked about the availability of our product. </st><st c="71762">For our end users, the platform must always be available, whether they’re the only user on the system or whether 1,000 others are trying to execute self-service tasks. </st><st c="71930">They also expect availability, regardless of whether there are any issues in our internal infrastructure or our cloud services. </st><st c="72058">This is when we talk about the resiliency of a system. </st><st c="72113">It means that despite any unexpected events (high load, component failures, connectivity issues, and so on), the system itself </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="72240">stays available.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="72256">From an</st><a id="_idIndexMarker301"/><st c="72264"> architectural perspective, there are many things we can do to make a system more resilient, thus leading to high availability. </st><st c="72392">Let’s consider our REST API example again. </st><st c="72435">From a deployment perspective, we can do </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="72476">the following:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="72490">Load balance replicated deployments</st></strong><st c="72526">: We can deploy our implementation using ReplicaSets, which leads to multiple actual Pod instances having to handle incoming requests. </st><st c="72662">Requests can be load balanced with round-robin or other more </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="72723">sophisticated algorithms.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="72748">Implement geographical diversity</st></strong><st c="72781">: To adhere to a global user base, we can deploy our implementation into regions where our users reside. </st><st c="72887">This reduces the impact of network latency and distributes the load, depending on where our </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="72979">users are.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="72989">Provide automatic scaling</st></strong><st c="73015">: </st><strong class="bold"><st c="73018">Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</st></strong><st c="73043"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="73045">HPA</st></strong><st c="73048">) and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="73055">Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling</st></strong><st c="73090"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="73092">KEDA</st></strong><st c="73096">) allow us to scale our implementation</st><a id="_idIndexMarker302"/><st c="73135"> based on indicators</st><a id="_idIndexMarker303"/><st c="73155"> such as CPU, memory, incoming requests, or even user experience. </st><st c="73221">This allows us to avoid most resource constraint </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="73270">resilience issues.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="73288">Perform automated backup and recovery</st></strong><st c="73326">: Not every issue can be averted. </st><st c="73361">If disaster strikes, it’s important to have automated backup and recovery options so that we can return to normal operation as fast </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="73493">as possible.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="73505">From a software architecture perspective, our REST API has </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="73565">several options:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="73581">API rate limiting</st></strong><st c="73599">: We can limit the number of incoming requests overall or from a particular user or team. </st><st c="73690">This avoids problems that may arise if someone accidentally (or on purpose) is flooding our system with too </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="73798">many requests.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="73812">Queuing incoming requests</st></strong><st c="73838">: Event-driven architectures allow us to queue requests and work on them when workers are available. </st><st c="73940">Workers can then also be scaled depending on queue length. </st><st c="73999">While additional layers, such as request queues, will potentially impact request latency, this architectural pattern will increase stability, resiliency, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="74153">and availability.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="74170">Retries and backoff to downstream systems</st></strong><st c="74212">: As we also make calls to backend systems such as Git or the logging observability backend, we want to make </st><a id="_idIndexMarker304"/><st c="74322">sure we aren’t impacted by problems on their end. </st><st c="74372">For this, we can implement API retries (in case an API call takes too long or fails) in combination with backoff (increasing the time between API calls). </st><st c="74526">Those strategies will increase our resiliency and also </st><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/><st c="74581">help our </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="74590">downstream systems.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3><st c="74609">Security</st></h3>
			<p><st c="74618">If our platform </st><a id="_idIndexMarker305"/><st c="74635">is available at any time, that’s a great start. </st><st c="74683">But like any software product, it has to also be secure. </st><st c="74740">This is even more important for platforms as they enable our end users to create, deploy, and operate new software applications that also have to be secure. </st><st c="74897">If our platform runs on a stack and tools that have known vulnerabilities or that can be hacked into, we’re open to attackers leveraging this for software supply chain attacks or to get access to confidential information. </st><st c="75119">Let’s look at our REST API again. </st><st c="75153">If we allow everyone to use that API to request logs from production, we may end up sending critical log information to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="75273">a hacker.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="75282">That’s why it’s important to apply the strictest security guidelines to our platform, every component and tool we use, and every line of code we’re developing. </st><st c="75443">In </st><a href="B31164_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor381"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="75446">Chapter 7</st></em></span></a><st c="75455">, we’ll cover the topic of building compliant and secure products in more detail, which is why we keep it at a high level here. </st><st c="75583">We must consider our platform to be the most critical software in our company. </st><st c="75662">Therefore, we must not deploy any components that have known vulnerabilities. </st><st c="75740">We must implement proper access control in all our custom-developed APIs. </st><st c="75814">We must use all the security scanning and alerting tools for our platform that we would also use for any business-critical software we run </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="75953">in production.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="75967">We’re the platform engineering team, which means we’re responsible for our platform’s security, just as we are for its</st><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/><st c="76086"> availability </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="76100">and resiliency!</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="76229">With</st><a id="_idIndexMarker306"/><st c="76233"> everything we’ve learned so far, we should be in a good position to not run into the problem we wanted to avoid from the start of this chapter. </st><st c="76378">We want to build something that our users love to use as it makes their lives easier. </st><st c="76464">But we can’t just claim success based on a gut feeling or anecdotal evidence. </st><st c="76542">We need to measure our impact and report our success based on KPIs and we need to leverage all the data we can observe from within our platform to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker307"/><st c="76689">keep optimizing those success KPIs, as well as the operational aspect of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="76762">the platform.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="76775">We’ve already talked a lot about observability, both as a self-service feature of our platform and for our end users, as well as using observability to understand the inner workings of our platform to ensure availability and resiliency. </st><st c="77013">Observing our platform components such as Backstage, ArgoCD, Jenkins, OpenFeature, Git, Harbor, Redis, Istio, and Kubernetes itself gives us a lot of insights into the success of our platform and its features. </st><st c="77223">Let’s dive into some key indicators, how to capture them, and what we can do with them to optimize our pl</st><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/><st c="77328">atform adoption </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="77345">and efficiency.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="77360">Active users</st></h3>
			<p><st c="77373">If tools </st><a id="_idIndexMarker308"/><st c="77383">such as</st><a id="_idIndexMarker309"/><st c="77390"> Backstage are the developer portal of choice for our platform, we’ll want to measure how many of our users log in to Backstage on a day or in a week. </st><st c="77541">We want to measure how many new projects get created through the Backstage templating engine and how many new or updated Git repositories that </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="77684">results in.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="77695">For our Financial One ACME use case on log analytics, we can measure how often our REST API is called. </st><st c="77799">As teams should identify with a team identifier or token, we can measure how many teams are using our feature and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="77913">how often.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="77923">These are all good indicators of current adoption. </st><st c="77975">If we see slow adoption, we can reach out with more education or utilize more one-on-one sessions to enable more teams. </st><st c="78095">We can also use the existing adoption of individual teams and create internal success stories to promote the platform’s capabilities to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="78231">other teams.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="78243">However, it’s important to start measuring how many active users we have on the platform and use this as a baseline so that we can set addi</st><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/><st c="78383">tional actions and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="78403">grow adoption!</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="78417">SLOs/DORA</st></h3>
			<p><st c="78427">A platform </st><a id="_idIndexMarker310"/><st c="78439">is a chance to promote best practices through self-service templates. </st><st c="78509">This is where SLOs come in. </st><st c="78537">Not only can we define SLOs for our platform components, such as availability, but we can take this as a chance to include SLO definitions in any new template for new software projects our end users are creating through our platform – we want their software to also be highly available, resilient, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="78835">and secure.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="78846">On top of that, we can measure how many new software projects and releases are created and published with the help of our platform. </st><st c="78979">We can look into the number of Jenkins job executions, how long they take, how often ArgoCD syncs, and how many of those deployments that end up in production meet their SLOs. </st><st c="79155">These are all indicators that help us report parts of the DORA metrics back to the engineering teams. </st><st c="79257">They need these metrics to show how efficient they are. </st><st c="79313">This also helps us, as the platform team, to highlight how much more efficient teams are becoming with the help of our platform as we assume metrics such as </st><em class="italic"><st c="79470">deployment frequency</st></em><st c="79490"> or </st><em class="italic"><st c="79494">lead time for change</st></em><st c="79514"> will improve. </st><st c="79529">We’ll cover DORA in more detail in </st><a href="B31164_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor255"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="79564">Chapter 5</st></em></span></a><st c="79573">, where</st><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/><st c="79580"> we’ll dive into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="79597">CI/CD automation!</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="79633">Having a</st><a id="_idIndexMarker311"/><st c="79642"> lot of users adopt our platform is a great goal and we’ve already learned how to measure it. </st><st c="79736">Bringing more teams onto a centralized platform allows us to centrally enforce best practices around the right-sizing and right-scaling of deployments and optimizing the utilization of the underlying infrastructure, which results in optimizing costs for the platform and all the apps that get deployed </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="80038">through it.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="80049">In </st><a href="B31164_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="80053">Chapter 1</st></em></span></a><st c="80062">, we mentioned a new European regulation for reporting carbon emissions. </st><st c="80135">This can also be done centrally as a platform capability by reporting actual resource utilization, the costs, and the calculated carbon impact of the platform, each platform service, and every application that gets deployed and operated through </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="80380">the platform.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="80393">There are many more such use cases that help us optimize the utilization of the underlying infrastructure to keep our costs under control. </st><st c="80533">Overall, this means that our platform is a </st><a id="_idIndexMarker312"/><st c="80576">great place for our </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="80596">FinOps initiatives!</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="81021">In this chapter, we learned how to approach platform engineering with a product mindset: find the real problem we need to solve, provide a simple quick solution to validate our implementation, identify how our platform fits into existing processes and organizational requirements, pitch a solution with the value proposition, which doesn’t just focus on development teams alone, and then design for flexibility without going down the route </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="81462">of over-engineering!</st></span></p>
