			<p class="author-quote">Success today requires the agility and speed to constantly innovate, coupled with the efficiency and discipline to deliver value consistently. Integrating Lean and Agile methodologies is the key to achieving this balance.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">—Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft</p>
			<p>The world is changing faster than we could ever imagine, and the pace of change will only accelerate <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>with the rise of <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>), <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>), and robotics. Automation and digitization have become the norm, allowing <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>individuals to do things more efficiently <span class="No-Break">and faster.</span></p>
			<p>Consequently, competing and thriving in the digital age require sensing and responding to market <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>changes and emerging opportunities. Recognizing this imperative, the <strong class="bold">Basic Lean-Agile Solution Team</strong> (<strong class="bold">BLAST</strong>) framework is your definitive guide to harmonizing Lean efficiency with <span class="No-Break">Agile adaptability.</span></p>
			<p>While Lean and Agile are based on different foundations, combining them creates unparalleled advantages. For example, Agile-based software delivery organizations have significantly improved their value flows by implementing highly integrated and automated DevOps pipelines. Laggards in DevOps transformation face obsolescence, underlining a hard truth: being solely Agile or Lean is not enough. Tomorrow’s leaders will be those who expertly integrate both methodologies, not just in software deliveries but across the organization. By helping to eliminate waste, Lean enables you to unlock more capacity for enhancing products and services, ultimately increasing the <span class="No-Break">bottom line.</span></p>
			<p>BLAST extends conventional Agile methodologies such as Scrum by orchestrating multiple small teams that generate work in continuous flows, yet seamlessly encompasses Agile’s iterative and incremental approach to developing new products and services or solving complex business and <span class="No-Break">technical problems.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, using BLAST, we detail the mechanics of combining Lean and Agile methods. BLAST’s 17 steps (see <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>) illustrate a comprehensive approach from concept to realization, promoting agility and lean efficiency for future-ready organizations. The topics covered in this chapter include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor380"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>There are no technical prerequisites for understanding the content in this chapter. However, you may find value in reviewing the concepts presented in <a href="B21818_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor106"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Solving Complex Business Problems with Agility</em>, and <a href="B21818_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Establishing Lean Flows to </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Improve Productivity</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor381"/>Harnessing BLAST</h1>
			<p>If problems were always small and manageable, an organization could simply employ one or two <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>small Agile teams, such as Scrum, to address its business problem-solving or development needs. However, this isn’t always the case, especially in larger organizations. Additionally, many of the individuals required to support business processes, systems, product, or service-oriented solutions have operational roles better suited to <em class="italic">Lean-flow practices</em>. </p>
			<p>Following the <strong class="bold">iterative and incremental development</strong> (<strong class="bold">IID</strong>) model of Agile, other teams within the BLAST collaborate to implement <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>solutions across timeboxed iterations, with varying durations, but always on a <span class="No-Break">set cadence.</span></p>
			<p>The longevity of Blast teams can vary, depending on the scope of work. For instance, a BLAST formed to implement a business process involving data integration across business systems might be relatively short term on the order of weeks to months. Conversely, BLAST teams formed to support ongoing business processes or commercial product and service development activities typically span their economically viable lifecycles, typically measured <span class="No-Break">in years.</span></p>
			<p>Operating <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>within the context of value streams, BLAST implements a team-of-teams concept to synchronize work across either a single value stream or multiple streams with the latter being more common. While some teams and individuals within BLAST adhere to Lean-flow principles and practices for their day-to-day <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>work, others follow Agile’s iterative and incremental patterns, using <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>methods such as <strong class="bold">Scrum</strong>, <strong class="bold">Kanban</strong>, or <strong class="bold">eXtreme </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Programming</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">XP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>We must <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>also consider hybrid situations where a team employs both Lean and Agile practices simultaneously. This is often seen in modern <a id="_idIndexMarker564"/>software delivery organizations that have implemented <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) and DevOps toolchains to integrate, streamline, and automate their processes. In modern software delivery pipelines, the BLAST teams operate in dual modes, leveraging Lean's flow for day-to-day operational work while using Agile's timeboxed model for planning , solution development, and delivery purposes. Finally, some domain experts from Lean-oriented operations teams may be called upon to support the efforts of Agile-oriented development teams on an ad hoc or <span class="No-Break">as-needed basis.</span></p>
			<p>Despite employing different work patterns, BLAST guides teams to collaborate in a coordinated manner, aligning their efforts across value streams. Regardless, the Lean-Agile <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>approach emphasizes continuous improvement of the <strong class="bold">customer experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">CX</strong>) and fosters a value-focused mindset among those involved in planning and execution. In summary, BLAST offers a clear strategy and structure for planning, integrating, and synchronizing solution development efforts across multiple teams, ensuring their collective contribution to <span class="No-Break">organizational goals.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we’ll delve into the mechanics of BLAST, exploring its role in enhancing collaborative excellence <span class="No-Break">across teams.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor382"/>Implementing Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams (BLAST)</h1>
			<p>One of <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>the hallmarks of the Scrum framework is its simplicity, with its three pillars, three roles, five events, and three artifacts. This simplicity makes Scrum an ideal Agile framework for individual <span class="No-Break">small teams.</span></p>
			<p>To properly scale Agile across the enterprise, we need to increase the number of teams, not the number of people within each team. While individual teams can retain Scrum’s simplicity to support their work, complexity arises when integrating and coordinating work across multiple teams. This is where the BLAST framework becomes crucial – to manage those complexities, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.1 – BLAST framework</p>
			<p>As you go through this chapter, continue to refer to <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>, which depicts the flow of work conducted by multiple Lean-Agile teams operating within <span class="No-Break">the BLAST.</span></p>
			<p>The authors have endeavored to maintain simplicity in the BLAST framework, but organizing the efforts of multiple teams operating in Lean and Agile modes requires more work. Unlike Scrum, which uses the term <em class="italic">events</em>, BLAST uses the term <em class="italic">steps</em> to imply <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>action and progress. As you go through this chapter, you will find that the BLAST framework helps teams coordinate the work of multiple Lean-Agile teams across seventeen steps in four <strong class="bold">core domains of work</strong>, with three supporting <strong class="bold">roles</strong> and three delivery <strong class="bold">artifacts</strong>. We already articulated the goals, foundational principles, and three pillars that make up the Lean-Agile house in <a href="B21818_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor010"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, so we won’t revisit <span class="No-Break">that here.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor383"/>Categorizing BLAST work activities</h2>
			<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>noted previously, BLAST’s seventeen (17) activities are grouped into four <span class="No-Break">primary categories:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Solution discovery</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">MVI planning</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Workflow coordination</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Customer feedback</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The purpose of this grouping is to break the BLAST development cycle down into logical components of work that facilitate our ability to iteratively and incrementally deliver value in a multi-team environment. Equally importantly, BLAST implements a closed-loop and customer-centric flow, ensuring that work progresses smoothly and continuously while maintaining flexibility <span class="No-Break">and adaptability.</span></p>
			<p>Customer centricity entails prioritizing the customer experience in everyone’s actions and attitudes. It’s a business-wide strategy that requires more than just considering the customer’s requirements. Customer-centric enterprises deliver whole-product solutions designed with a profound understanding of customer needs. This approach improves employee alignment, which enhances customer delight and ultimately drives increased revenue and profitability in commercial enterprises. Nonprofits and governments benefit by better serving their beneficiaries and citizens to fulfill <span class="No-Break">their missions.</span></p>
			<p>The subsections that follow describe each of the activities within these four categories, delineating the flow of work in a manner that ensures streamlined integration of Lean and Agile principles. We’ll start with the activities that form BLAST’s customer-centric foundations involving <span class="No-Break">solutions discovery.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor384"/>Defining BLAST increments</h2>
			<p>A BLAST <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>focuses on creating <strong class="bold">minimum valuable increments</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVIs</strong>). However, MVIs are not always released as soon as they are available. Very often, MVIs will be bundled together to create an MVRs. These MVRs may <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>come from one BLAST or from multiple BLASTs. When this occurs, the sequence within which we create the MVIs may be dependent upon their  being bundled with other MVIs to create an MVR or integrated increment. Conceptually, an integrated increment is a bundling of MVIs to assemble a complete solution or components of a product release. MVRs are specified in BASE planning activities since they are part of product <span class="No-Break">management-defined releases.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor385"/>Solution discovery (steps 1 and 2)</h2>
			<p>Customer-centric enterprises consider customer value, needs, and wants as the most important <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>factors in planning and executing. This philosophy should guide every <span class="No-Break">business decision.</span></p>
			<p>The following foundational steps initiate value-stream improvements for <span class="No-Break">BLAST teams:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer journey</strong>: At the core of our approach is a deep understanding of our customers’ needs and values. The customer journey encompasses every interaction and touchpoint, from initial awareness to purchase, usage, and beyond, potentially leading to advocacy or r<a id="_idTextAnchor386"/>epurchase. Achieving positive user experiences and customer satisfaction entails continuous evaluation and enhancement of our value proposition through direct <span class="No-Break">customer engagement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business value backlog</strong>: Business value is created by translating customer needs into actionable, prioritized work items that provide comprehensive solutions. The business value backlog starts by identifying potential work items as raw ideas and concepts. Through refinement, these ideas are vetted to fully understand the scope of work involved and prioritize them based on adding the most customer-centric value with the available time and resources. The business value backlog captures <span class="No-Break">this understanding.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>BLAST goes beyond theory and supports the use of practices that lead to a profound understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>of customer value and needs. A product is more than the sum of its features; a whole-product approach considers everything involved in the customer journey, from purchase to use <span class="No-Break">and support.</span></p>
			<p>After establishing a customer-centric foundation, the BLAST teams move on to address <strong class="bold">MVI planning</strong>, laying the groundwork for value-driven delivery and <span class="No-Break">mak<a id="_idTextAnchor387"/>ing commitments.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor388"/>MVI planning (steps 3 and 4)</h2>
			<p>This subsection explores how teams collaborate to plan and refine their objectives, strategize <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>their work, and ensure fast value delivery and feedback. Ultimately, we need agreement on the team’s short-term goals to manage and eliminate dependencies, integrate requirements, and optimize <span class="No-Break">the workflow:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">MVI refinement</strong>: The value manager (product owner) and developers collaborate to refine requirements, architectures, and designs to create the right products, services, or information assets for their customers. This refinement process focuses on three critical areas: decomposing epics into story-level details, addressing architectural and design issues, and determining the lower-level tasks needed to implement the desired features <span class="No-Break">and functionality.</span><p class="list-inset">Epics are simply large stories that have yet to be broken down into refined and actionable user and technical stories. In contrast, stories are detailed enough to build the features and functions needed to implement <span class="No-Break">the requirements.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">BLAST planning</strong>: Delivering customer value entails breaking down work into usable, functional increments, often necessitating collaboration among multiple cross-functional teams. This critical activity involves teams coordinating who is responsible for each task and when it will be completed and ensuring synchronization and integration of their efforts. Teams strive for continuous and frequent deliveries on cadence, releasing products and services in collaboration with value managers/product owners and <span class="No-Break">other stakeholders.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Mastering the nuances of BLAST planning ensures that the teams’ efforts directly align with customer needs and drive tangible business results. By aligning tactical plans with strategic <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>objectives and making clear commitments, teams can achieve high-quality business outcomes, enhancing their credibility and impact within <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p>As the BLAST teams shift from planning to action, they move on to the heart of BLAST’s operational model. In the next subsection, on <strong class="bold">workflow coordination</strong>, we’ll learn how teams bring their plans to life, seamlessly integrate workflows, and ensure they can effectively adapt to address challenges <span class="No-Break">during execution.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor389"/>Workflow coordination (steps 5 to 11)</h2>
			<p>BLAST <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>emphasizes that robust execution must be in alignment with MVI planning objectives. For BLAST teams, understanding and implementing the steps of execution, integration, and coordination ensures that the planned efforts are effectively realized within the <span class="No-Break">given timebox.\</span></p>
			<p>Modern integrated DevOps toolchains enable automated configuration, builds, testing, and deployment, shifting product development left in the delivery cycle. Agile’s iterative and incremental cadences seamlessly integrate with the Lean flow to facilitate planning and release cycles. Automation ensures that every product development step is streamlined, reducing manual errors and enhancing the <span class="No-Break">value flow.</span></p>
			<p>The following section introduces seven steps across two flow operating models for executing and integrating Lean-Agile workflows, as described in the <span class="No-Break">following list:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Commitment backlog</strong>: After reviewing requirements, design, and acceptance criteria, teams commit to completing the scope of work they have reviewed and accepted for the next increment. It’s crucial to note that these commitments should be driven by customer needs rather than external influences or driven by team or other stakeholder preferences. Flexibility is key; commitments should not be driven by siloed or traditional project <span class="No-Break">management behavior.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Commitments cannot be made without sufficient refinement and planning completed in advance. Development teams must be confident that they have the requirements and acceptance criteria sufficiently defined to understand what they need to build. With this understanding and knowledge of their capacity, teams can make informed <span class="No-Break">delivery commitments.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2"><strong class="bold">Lean teams</strong>: Teams that perform repetitive work, where productivity, quality, and efficiency are critical concerns, or that want to minimize delays in the workflow, often choose the flow track. In other words, they operate predominantly <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>using Lean-oriented practices, focusing on ensuring the smooth flow of work, people, information, and materials within a <span class="No-Break">business environment.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kaizen</strong>: In a Lean team, Kaizen events are focused improvement activities to enhance processes, workflows, and outcomes. These events bring together cross-functional team members to analyze specific areas for improvement, identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks, and brainstorm <span class="No-Break">solutions collaboratively.</span><p class="list-inset">By regularly engaging in Kaizen events, BLAST teams foster a culture of continuous improvement, allowing them to refine their practices iteratively, streamline workflows, and optimize performance. This iterative approach enables teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements and market conditions, increasing efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction in the <span class="No-Break">development process.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agile teams</strong>: Teams working to solve complex business problems, plan new increments, or develop or enhance processes, products, and services typically choose the timeboxed development track. For example, the timeboxed development approach of Agile practices (e.g., Scrum) allows teams to iteratively experiment with different concepts and incrementally deploy new features <span class="No-Break">and capabilities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Retrospectives</strong>: Agile-based teams must rapidly adjust when an issue or impediment blocks the completion of committed work. If an issue arises, teams should have a bias for action and resolve the problem as soon as possible to avoid the accumulation of increasingly complex and challenging problems. A Scrum Master, Value Manager, or equivalent role can help the team resolve impediments, depending on the Agile <span class="No-Break">method employed.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">BLAST iterations</strong>: Synchronizing and integrating the work of multiple teams is challenging when some teams use a timeboxed approach while others follow a continuous flow approach. BLAST facilitates cross-team integration via a shared <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>backlog, BLAST planning discussions, and decomposing work into actionable work items. Additionally, implementing cross-team reviews and retrospectives on a regular cadence helps teams align their activities and discover ways to improve their collaboration <span class="No-Break">and work.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">MVI outputs</strong>: In mature software delivery organizations, proper team structure and cross-team working agreements reduce the need for synchronization of efforts. However, whole product releases deployed as MVIs may involve teams from disparate business domains working together to coordinate the entire value chain delivery. For example, R&amp;D, legal, product and marketing management, sales, architecture, finance, development, support, and partner management organizations all contribute to a successful <span class="No-Break">MVR release.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor390"/>Customer feedback (steps 12 to 17)</h2>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>stage encompasses the essential customer feedback loops aimed at align<a id="_idTextAnchor391"/>ing our future efforts to evolve processes, products, and services in a value-oriented manner. This section will delve into steps 12 through 17 of the BLAST framework, which enable us to evolve and improve continuously to meet our <span class="No-Break">customers’ needs:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrated increments</strong>: This step is a staging activity for MVIs. Following the workflow coordination stage, which outputs a series of MVIs related to the MVR planned for the current business increment, these MVIs form part of the larger release, though they are often interconnected. The MVI outputs produced across these business functions arrive as needed and may be released at different time intervals. For instance, marketing promotions frequently commence well ahead of a product release. The coordinated and synchronized release of MVIs within an MVR follows the increment <span class="No-Break">release process.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reviews</strong>: An MVI should not be released to its intended customers without an appropriate review to validate that the outputs meet the requirements specified during refinement in the business value backlog. For example, customers and users are the ultimate arbiters of the value provided by your products and services. However, executives and other stakeholders need to confirm that process and systems updates achieve the business and compliance requirements that justified <span class="No-Break">their investments.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feedback and pivot</strong>: Integrated increment reviews are ineffective if the value provided fails to achieve its goals and we do not capture feedback and take appropriate action. This activity ensures that bugs (errors in development) and defects (errors in understanding requirements) in the delivered products and services <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>are properly documented and sent back to the MVI refinement process, re-entering the business value backlog for reprioritization. Skipping this step by releasing the product or immediately putting it back into the development stream will certainly cause more problems for <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Needs analysis</strong>: This activity is the BLAST equivalent to Scrum’s retrospectives at the team of teams level. Individual teams meet at the end of each BLAST iteration to assess their performance and identify ways to improve in future BLAST cycles. Since BLAST is a team-of-teams concept, each team should appoint a representative who is best qualified to take their findings to a joint meeting with other teams. In these meetings, the representatives collaboratively address integration, synchronization, and dependency issues to enhance future BLAST cycles. Team representatives then share the recommendations from their ToT assessments with their teams to implement the improvements. For complex issues, several iterations may be required to achieve the <span class="No-Break">desired outcomes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deployed integrated increments</strong>: This is the path our released MVIs take when judgments from the integrated increment review indicate that the value meets our customers’ expectations. MVIs and MVRs typically consist of multiple solution <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>components for customers, and the organization must ensure that each component is <span class="No-Break">fully deployed.</span><p class="list-inset">For example, we <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>cannot release products for resale through our <strong class="bold">value-added resellers</strong> (<strong class="bold">VARs</strong>) without fully deploying the necessary communications, promotions, training, product information, and support artifacts required to ensure the success of our partners. From the example provided, it should be clear that an integrated increment may consist of components from multiple BLASTs, coordinated to deliver a cohesive and <span class="No-Break">comprehensive solution.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer experience</strong>: After deploying a new product or service to our customers, CX programs are essential to ensure ongoing customer satisfaction and loyalty. These programs should encompass various initiatives to gather feedback, promptly address issues, and continuously enhance the <span class="No-Break">customer journey.</span><p class="list-inset">Examples of relevant CX methods are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p><ul><li>Surveys <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>and <span class="No-Break">feedback forms</span></li><li>Net promoter <span class="No-Break">score (NPS)</span></li><li>Customer <span class="No-Break">journey mapping</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">User testing</span></li><li>Social <span class="No-Break">media monitoring</span></li><li>Customer <span class="No-Break">support analysis</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Focus groups</span></li></ul></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Key components of effective CX programs include customer interviews and sentiment analysis to gain insights into customer satisfaction and preferences. Additionally, proactive customer support and engagement strategies are vital for addressing issues and providing personalized assistance. Regular monitoring of customer interactions helps identify areas for improvement, foster long-term relationships, drive loyalty, and maximize the success of our products or services on <span class="No-Break">the market.</span></p>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>concludes our walk-through of the BLAST framework. You may notice similarities with other Agile frameworks, particularly Scrum. But the goal of BLAST is to cohesively integrate two fundamental management philosophies: Lean and Agile principles and practices. As always, the details matter. So, let’s spend the rest of the chapter understanding BLAST implementation details, starting with a discussion on how to integrate Lean and Agile practices into a <span class="No-Break">multi-team environment.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor392"/>Integrating Lean-Agile development concepts</h1>
			<p>BLAST integrates Lean and Agile methods, a strategy designed to empower multiple teams to <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>collaborate effectively on complex business challenges. A fundamental aspect of BLAST is its dual nature: Lean for daily operational efficiency and Agile for fostering innovative <span class="No-Break">product changes.</span></p>
			<p>In many organizations, team members are primarily expected to operate within the Lean framework, as discussed in <a href="B21818_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Establishing Lean Flows to Improve Productivity</em>, which aligns with the organization’s focus on value delivery. This emphasis on Lean principles forms a foundational element of the BLAST framework. However, BLAST also incorporates Agile components that enable cadence-based business and product planning, driving the development of new products, services, or other <span class="No-Break">business-enabling artifacts.</span></p>
			<p>BLAST is a transformative approach to work aimed at overcoming limiting beliefs and practices that may hinder an organization’s full realization of Lean-Agile’s potential. Despite BLAST’s well-defined processes and activities designed to enhance team collaboration and effectiveness, its methods should be continually tailored to best suit your <span class="No-Break">unique context.</span></p>
			<p>In the subsection that follows, we’ll look at how to align the work of multiple teams working together on developing a <span class="No-Break">specific solution.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor393"/>Aligning teams for collaborative excellence</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">BLAST operates on a key principle:</strong> <em class="italic">When teams align around shared goals to support the organization’s value streams, they collaboratively deliver the maximum value efficiently </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">and cost-effectively.</em></span></p>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>aligned, teams can be given more autonomy, go beyond simple coordination, and consistently get better results with less effort. With a mutual goal of enhancing delivery capabilities, the participating teams inherently understand the importance of relentlessly improving products, services, business systems, and processes. They realize that substantial improvements come from optimizing flows, eliminating waste, and focusing on key <span class="No-Break">enhancement opportunities.</span></p>
			<p>A critical aspect of BLAST is the seamless integration of work, ensuring fast feedback. In contrast, lacking harmony and goal alignment can result in fragmented operations, increased overhead, and wasted resources. At the heart of this alignment is a commitment to customer-centricity, emphasizing unrivaled value delivery through innovative products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor394"/>Combining Lean and Agile practices</h2>
			<p>While rooted in the principles of Lean Flows, BLAST does not ignore the advantages that Agile IID <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>methodologies offer. It highlights the role of small, adaptable teams that consistently deliver value. Supporting the organization’s value streams, BLAST teams embrace Lean values, focusing on maintaining a continuous flow of value, minimizing inefficiencies, and swiftly adapting <span class="No-Break">to changes.</span></p>
			<p>While Lean supports sustained improvements in quality, productivity, and efficiency, adding Agile methods ensures that teams remain flexible in today’s global economy. By integrating iterative cycles and responsiveness, BLAST ensures teams respond quickly to changing customer needs and market conditions. Together, Lean’s efficiency and Agile’s adaptability position organizations to meet customer demands while continuously improving and innovating. Moreover, BLAST’s Lean orientation provides improvement insights that feed the organization’s holistic <span class="No-Break">VSM initiatives.</span></p>
			<p>In short, BLAST enables teams to achieve maximum efficiency and productivity by employing Lean’s flow-oriented concepts, while others opt for Agile’s iterative and incremental approach to problem-solving, business planning, and development. Additionally, certain team members, especially domain and technology experts, may be required to support both approaches when assisting multiple <span class="No-Break">teams’ efforts.</span></p>
			<p>Yet, even as we recognize the strengths of these combined methods, we must also address where decision-making authority should reside. The next subsection discusses how aligning values helps blend traditional and modern <span class="No-Break">management approaches.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor395"/>Defining BLAST roles</h2>
			<p>Note that BLAST does not include the concept of formal <em class="italic">events</em>. The closest we come is the 17 <em class="italic">steps</em> defined in BLAST. However, since BLAST is a Lean-Agile methodology, it’s more appropriate <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>to consider each <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>step a defined activity within a BLAST-oriented value stream. With this understanding, let’s see how BLAST defines <span class="No-Break">its roles.</span></p>
			<p>In BLAST, we approach roles and responsibilities clearly, aiming not to replace terms from other Agile or Lean-Agile disciplines but to offer greater precision. One such role is the <em class="italic">value manager</em>, functionally equivalent the <em class="italic">product owner</em> in Scrum. Another is the <em class="italic">value coach</em> in place of the <em class="italic">scrum master</em>. But even more importantly, we don’t want to change the common terms used in yo<a id="_idTextAnchor396"/>ur industry or business domains. So, these roles are meant to be abstractions to define the responsibilities given to individuals within a Lean-Agile enterprise. Renaming these roles is not mandatory, but it brings greater clarity. With this understanding, let’s examine the role of the <span class="No-Break">value manager.</span></p>
			<h3>Defining the role of value manager</h3>
			<p>In BLAST, to support the sustainment of Lean-Agile practices within an enterprise, instead <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>of a traditional product owner, we introduce the <strong class="bold">value manager</strong>. This renaming isn’t about displacing Scrum terminology <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>but clarifying it from a Lean-Agile context. The value manager emphasizes value delivery in all forms, minimizing any misconceptions tied to the Scrum product owner. For example, in large organizations, we have sometimes observed that software is developed but not properly supported because budgets for creating potential customer value were separate from budgets to operate and support the delivered <span class="No-Break">software products.</span></p>
			<p>The value manager balances stakeholder and customer demands, clearly articulating the backlog to guide teams toward high-priority tasks. The name captures the role’s essence while sidestepping Scrum-associated pitfalls of focusing solely on product-oriented backlogs. In contrast, the role of a value manager is to evaluate and prioritize all work from a <span class="No-Break">value-added context.</span></p>
			<p>There are varied approaches in BLAST to executing the value manager role and organizations are free to use unique terms for the role to express their responsibilities. The value manager, ideally an executive-level position within the company, provides support <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>and guidance to the chief executives and shareholders, ensuring decisions align with the company’s best interests and deliver maximum customer value. They contribute to compliance efforts, financial reporting, risk management, and stakeholder relations within the product line they support, promoting ethical leadership and <span class="No-Break">corporate governance.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s move on to understanding the role of <strong class="bold">developers</strong> in the <span class="No-Break">BLAST framework.</span></p>
			<h3>Defining the role of developers</h3>
			<p>In BLAST, developers are the core individuals who create value in the processes, systems, products, and services they deliver. But they’re not just isolated talents—they form a <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>cohesive unit with a shared mission. In other words, they are the value stream team members in a <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile environment.</span></p>
			<p>So, in BLAST, which can <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>be applied across commercial, government, or non-profit sectors, the term <em class="italic">developer</em> is not confined to specific roles; rather, it signifies anyone supporting the organization’s Lean-Agile value streams. Let’s look at some of their <span class="No-Break">defining characteristics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Unified vision</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Self-contained</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Employs a </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ToT structure</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Clearly </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">defined roles</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Cross-functional</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Avoids dependencies</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Value focused</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whether it’s solving intricate business challenges, devising technical solutions, crafting business artifacts, or delivering products and services for an array of customers (internal or external), all these activities fall under the developer umbrella. Recognizing and valuing this diversity is critical to maximizing the team’s potential <span class="No-Break">and output.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s move on to defining the role of a <strong class="bold">value coach</strong> <span class="No-Break">in BLAST.</span></p>
			<h3>Defining the role of value coach</h3>
			<p>The value coach is an essential figure in BLAST, primarily responsible for steering the team <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>toward its goals, facilitating effective communication, and ensuring adherence to <span class="No-Break">best practices.</span></p>
			<p>Often, development <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>teams might focus on individual tasks and overlook the bigger picture. Continuous improvement can be sidelined, and individual commitments might be neglected. A value coach ensures the team remains aligned with its core objectives and <span class="No-Break">constantly evolves.</span></p>
			<p>The value coach role in BLAST encompasses a range of responsibilities crucial to team dynamics and overall progress, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Facilitates <span class="No-Break">team growth</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Supports improvements</span></li>
				<li>Facilitate <span class="No-Break">external communications</span></li>
				<li>Encourages a <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile mindset</span></li>
				<li>Servant <span class="No-Break">leadership style</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This completes our discussion on BLAST team roles and responsibilities. The objective is not to enforce terms, roles, and responsibilities that don’t align with your industry, domain practices, or organizational preferences. BLAST is a framework to help orchestrate the work of multiple Lean-Agile teams to create solutions. It’s not meant to establish rigid rules and procedures. Instead, the aim is to provide clarity on roles and responsibilities that improve the functioning of Lean-Agile work environments and give you the freedom to make it work in your unique <span class="No-Break">business context.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we will explore inter-team collaboration in the <span class="No-Break">BLAST framework.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor397"/>Facilitating inter-team collaboration</h2>
			<p>In various scaled Agile frameworks, team ambassadors or liaisons serve as communication <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>points between teams to facilitate coordination and alignment.<span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-001"><span id="endnote-001-backlink">1</span></a></span> For example, Scrum of Scrums, Scrum at Scale, Nexus, and SAFe® all have roles or other mechanisms to fulfill the <span class="No-Break">liaison role.</span></p>
			<p>In the BLAST framework, we endorse the concept of supporting collaborating teams; however, we refrain from assigning specific names to these roles. We believe that every situation is unique and requires tailored solutions. Additionally, these positions are often dynamic, with individuals being called upon ad hoc as <span class="No-Break">needs arise.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, one or more employees from the accounting department might be summoned to assist a software development team as domain experts in ensuring compliance with financial regulations within a financial application. In such cases, the assignment is both temporary and <span class="No-Break">part time.</span></p>
			<p>We spoke previously about the relevance of management in a Lean-Agile organization, so let’s go back to that topic and spend a bit more time reviewing <span class="No-Break">their role.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor398"/>Balancing decision-making approaches</h2>
			<p>Traditional management philosophies often favor a top-down approach, guiding organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>through centralized decision-making. In other words, the boss tells us what to do. However, this <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>approach risks being perceived as autocratic, and management may overlook information available only <span class="No-Break">to teams.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, Agile practices embrace a more participatory, bottom-up approach where the insights and contributions of team members are of higher importance. However, decentralized decision-making across the organization requires more collaboration, and teams may encounter coordination challenges, especially when a team of teams has different viewpoints, goals, and objectives. If we limit our views to these two management extremes, one could argue that a top-down strategy may provide clearer strategic intent even as the decentralized approach can improve the engagement and alignment of employees in <span class="No-Break">their work.</span></p>
			<p>Lean provides a more balanced approach by considering the roles of executive and middle management in supporting the work of multiple teams as they interact across one or more value streams. For example, in a Lean organization, executive managers serve as the architects of organizational strategy, orchestrating the vision and providing a cohesive force that aligns all levels of the company. Middle managers also play a crucial role in Lean organizations as they directly support the value streams. In BLAST, these are our value managers and value coaches. They are often referred to as the “glue” that holds companies together, bridging the gap between top management and <span class="No-Break">lower-level workers.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, Lean organizations often combine the strengths of top-down and bottom-up paradigms, offering a balanced approach that delivers better business outcomes. This balanced approach, which we refer to as a Middle-Up-Down management strategy, enables <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>a high-level view of <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>what is needed while empowering teams to decide how to work within <span class="No-Break">that context.</span></p>
			<p>In the next subsection, we are going to take a deeper dive into<a id="_idTextAnchor399"/> the topic of decentralized decision-making from an Agile-based context at the small <span class="No-Break">team level.</span></p>
			<h3>Fostering decentralization</h3>
			<p>The wider acceptance of Agile-based practices helped start a movement to adopt more streamlined <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>organizational structures. Agile organizational structures foster self-organizing, cross-functional teams that no <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>longer need traditional project managers to push work across silos. Therefore, Agile teams need less daily task direction and rely more on self-management with the assistance of roles such as scrum masters, product owners, and <span class="No-Break">agile coaches.</span></p>
			<p>The list that <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>follows defines the key characteristics <span class="No-Break">of decentralization:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flatter structures</strong>: Agile organizations typically favor flatter structures with self-managed teams that do not require daily <span class="No-Break">task direction.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Distributed decision-making</strong>: Don Reinertsen emphasizes the importance of “balancing centralization and decentralization” in his book <em class="italic">The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development</em>. <span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-002"><span id="endnote-002-backlink">2</span></a></span>, <span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-003"><span id="endnote-003-backlink">3</span></a></span> Every decision that must be escalated may cause delayed value flow and produce poorer decisions when people are too far from where the information lives. BLAST concurs with Reinertsen and the <strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Framework</strong>® (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>®)<span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-004"><span id="endnote-004-backlink">4</span></a></span>,<span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-005"><span id="endnote-005-backlink">5</span></a></span> that leaders should make and communicate strategic decisions—those <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>that are infrequent, long-lasting, and have significant economies of scale; all other decisions should be decentralized. <span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-006"><span id="endnote-006-backlink">6</span></a></span>, <span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-007"><span id="endnote-007-backlink">7</span></a></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Servant leadership</strong>: Agile emphasizes facilitation and coaching over traditional hierarchical authority. Servant leaders empower individuals and teams to <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>excel by fostering a culture of responsibility and autonomy. Let’s look at two common roles, the agile coach and the <span class="No-Break">scrum master:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Agile Coaches</strong> plan and <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>deliver, facilitate events, establish best practices, advise leadership, and break down barriers <span class="No-Break">between teams</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Scrum Masters</strong> ensure the <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>team understands Scrum, facilitate Scrum events, support the goals outlined by the Product Owner, remove team impediments, and shield the team <span class="No-Break">from interference</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous feedback loop</strong>: The <strong class="bold">plan-do-study-act</strong> (<strong class="bold">PDSA</strong>) cycle, originally <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>defined by Shewhart and popularized by Deming, is an effective method for gaining faster feedback and controlling unwanted variability during solution development.<span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-008"><span id="endnote-008-backlink">8</span></a></span> <span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-009"><span id="endnote-009-backlink">9</span></a>,</span> This loop fosters improvement and development through a consistent and continuous flow of feedback. More frequent and shorter PDSA cycles result in <span class="No-Break">faster learning.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The decentralized decision model of Agile works well in small team environments where the scope of work is constrained. However, as the scope of work increases to involve multiple teams, or agility becomes an enterprise-wide objective, the decentralized model falls short. Fortunately, this is where Lean management practices offer a more compelling management model. Before we get to that topic, let’s look more closely at why larger organizations struggle to implement flat structures and <span class="No-Break">decentralized decision-making.</span></p>
			<h3>Managing cross-team interactions</h3>
			<p>A common approach to coordinating the work of multiple teams in scaled Scrum methodologies is to implement team-of-teams structures with representatives facilitating the bulk of the communications between team members and other stakeholders. However, even this approach can become overwhelming. This is one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>reasons why Lean organizations retain middle and upper management positions, ensuring<a id="_idTextAnchor400"/> that communication remains effective <span class="No-Break">and manageable.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor401"/>Embracing Lean leadership</h2>
			<p>Having flat and decentralized organizational structures is beneficial up to a point. However, as explained in the previous subsection, the number of potential interfaces between <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>team members and stakeholders can become unmanageable. Simply put, more people are needed to facilitate communication <span class="No-Break">and alignment.</span></p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>dynamic landscape of Lean methodologies, organizations work to blend established <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>hierarchical structures with progressive leadership practices. The <strong class="bold">Toyota Production System</strong> (<strong class="bold">TPS</strong>) offers a prime example of Lean <span class="No-Break">management principles.</span></p>
			<p>Within TPS, traditional management hierarchies remain intact, ensuring a clear chain of command from frontline supervisors to top executives. However, this approach is not rigid “command and control.” Instead, Lean leadership emphasizes leading by example, adopting servant leadership, and flattening operational structures to support value streams. The focus shifts from authority to collaboration, continuous improvement, and empowering employees.<span class="superscript"> <a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-010"><span id="endnote-010-backlink">10</span></a>, <a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-011"><span id="endnote-011-backlink">11</span></a>,</span> <span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-012"><span id="endnote-012-backlink">12</span></a></span></p>
			<h3>Adopting traditional hierarchies with a twist</h3>
			<p>In Lean organizations, management hierarchies still exist, serving as the framework that supports <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>efficient operations. The TPS model exemplifies this, with distinct layers of management ensuring seamless coordination. TPS integrates hierarchical management with decentralized authority and empowering practices to create a balanced and effective organizational structure. This approach combines clear command structures with the empowerment of frontline workers, fostering a culture of continuous improvement <span class="No-Break">and collaboration.</span></p>
			<h3>Implementing key management structures and principles</h3>
			<p>To successfully blend hierarchical management with decentralized and empowering practices, Lean <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>organizations, like those employing the TPS, have developed a comprehensive approach. This <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>involves maintaining clear command structures while empowering frontline workers and fostering continuous improvement. The following key structures and principles outline how TPS achieves this balance, ensuring that efficiency and innovation coexist harmoniously within <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Hierarchical management</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Clear Chain of Command</strong>: TPS maintains a traditional hierarchy to ensure order and clarity in decision-making, from frontline supervisors to <span class="No-Break">top-level executives</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Role of executives</strong>: Executives set strategic direction and foster a culture of continuous improvement <span class="No-Break">and innovation</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Decentralization </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">and empowerment:</strong></span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Gemba walks</strong>: Leaders conduct Gemba walks to observe operations firsthand, stay connected to real-time challenges, and foster <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Empowering frontline workers</strong>: Management encourages workers to identify and solve problems, ensuring quality through principles such as <em class="italic">jidoka</em> (automation with a <span class="No-Break">human touch)</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Middle management </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">as facilitators</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Bridge role</strong>: Middle managers translate strategic goals into operational activities, supporting teams with resources <span class="No-Break">and guidance</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Servant leadership</strong>: Middle managers function as servant leaders, removing obstacles and supporting team efforts toward <span class="No-Break">operational excellence</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Team structures</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Cross-functional teams</strong>: Small, cross-functional teams, working across functional departments and value streams, collaborate to solve problems and <span class="No-Break">implement improvements</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement (Kaizen)</strong>: Teams regularly engage in Kaizen assessment activities to enhance processes and <span class="No-Break">eliminate waste</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leading </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">by example</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Going where the work is:</strong> In Lean, leadership involves leading by example through active participation in problem-solving and continuous improvement processes. Practices such as Gemba walks, where leaders visit the actual workplace <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>to observe operations and engage directly with employees, exemplify <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>this approach by fostering firsthand understanding <span class="No-Break">and collaboration.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Focused decision-making</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Strategic alignment</strong>: Although feedback from all levels is essential, strategic decisions typically align with the hierarchical structure to ensure coherence with the organization’s broader goals, budget, and schedule considerations. This process is <span class="No-Break">also collaborative.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Middle-up-down management</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Roles</strong>: In the Lean approach, middle managers play a crucial role. They look up to leadership to understand the organization’s strategic vision while simultaneously looking down and across value streams to identify how to achieve <span class="No-Break">that vision.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Responsibilities</strong>: Their primary responsibility is to create an environment where the strategic vision can be <span class="No-Break">effectively realized.</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By combining these management structures and principles, we can implement a balanced management framework that supports both efficiency and innovation. This creates a dynamic environment where hierarchy coexists with value-based delivery streams and small teams, fostering agility and <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have a foundational understanding of Lean management, let’s move on to explore how BLAST teams <span class="No-Break">are managed.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor402"/>Conducting Gemba walks for Lean leadership</h2>
			<p>BLAST, with <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>its Lean orientation, adopts Lean’s <strong class="bold">middle-up-down management</strong> approach. While hierarchical management structures <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>are retained in Lean organizations, managers do not remain isolated in their offices; instead, they go to where the work <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>takes place to understand the realities of the work environment. They are not there to find fault, but to better understand the issues and how they can help address them. This practice, known as a <strong class="bold">Gemba walk</strong>, involves managers and leaders visiting the actual workplace to observe processes firsthand and interact directly with those performing <span class="No-Break">the work.</span></p>
			<p>In virtual or remote work environments, leaders can achieve the essence of Gemba through digital workplace tours and online collaborative discussions, ensuring they remain connected to real-time challenges and nuances of <span class="No-Break">the work.</span></p>
			<p>By encouraging leaders to immerse themselves in the work environment, organizations foster a direct, two-way understanding between management and frontline teams. This hands-on engagement ensures that leaders are informed and deeply connected to daily challenges and opportunities for improving value delivery. It also cultivates a culture of mutual respect, where teams feel their contributions are genuinely recognized and valued. Executives, managers, and team leaders within a BLAST environment prioritize value delivery and work to remove barriers caused by siloed <span class="No-Break">organizational structures.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor403"/>Managing multi-tiered reviews and communications</h2>
			<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>Lean-Agile organizations, the role of the product owner—referred to as the <strong class="bold">value manager</strong> in BLAST—leads <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>planning. In a Lean-Agile organization, value <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>is obtained through improvements in processes, infrastructure, tools and equipment, systems, products, and services. Therefore, the value manager role is multi-faceted in its scope <span class="No-Break">and complexity.</span></p>
			<p>This individual also requires strategic foresight to maintain a consistent and relevant flow of work items into the organization’s development pipelines. This is not merely about responding to immediate customer needs but involves a deeper alignment with corporate strategy, objectives, and portfolio management, particularly when new circumstances necessitate skills, software, tooling, and <span class="No-Break">equipment changes.</span></p>
			<p>Adopting a multi-tiered planning approach is essential in this context. This involves integrating annual strategic planning cycles with frequent quarterly portfolio and product management planning sessions. These are further supplemented by regular product design and planning activities, creating a cohesive and responsive team planning approach that adapts to the dynamic demands placed on software and product <span class="No-Break">development teams.</span></p>
			<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>organizations seeking to harness Lean-Agile practices for competitive advantage, understanding and effectively implementing multi-tiered planning cadences ensures <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>that development efforts consistently align with strategic goals, maximizing efficiency and driving innovation. Effective Lean-Agile planning enhances organizational agility and supports sustained <span class="No-Break">competitive success.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s discuss how team-level planning changes in a <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile organization.</span></p>
			<h3>Improving daily meetings</h3>
			<p>Have you ever found yourself in a Daily Scrum meeting where the energy is noticeably low, and people’s eyes glaze over during the monotonous repetition of information? Do you <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>observe team members multi-tasking or, worse, disengaging and not paying attention to their colleagues’ updates? If so, you are not alone. This scenario is more common than you might think and happens for <span class="No-Break">several reasons.</span></p>
			<p>For example, team members often feel sufficiently updated through other communication channels and meetings since the last Daily Scrum. Discussions may delve into excessive detail, shifting focus from quick updates to problem-solving sessions better suited for follow-up discussions. Or are there too many people in your meetings? In our experience, any Scrum meeting with more than seven to nine attendees will become unwieldy, leading to disengagement <span class="No-Break">and discontent.</span></p>
			<p>Recognizing these challenges is the first step toward improving your daily meetings, ensuring they serve their intended purpose—inspecting progress toward the sprint goal, coordinating the day’s work, adjusting upcoming planned work, and resolving impediments. The team can use any structure or technique for the Daily Scrum. However, the team should not wait for these daily meetings to adjust. The team should collaboratively adapt, or re-plan work whenever needed. Let’s examine some ways <span class="No-Break">to improve:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Refine the Daily Scrum process</strong>: Consider reducing the frequency of Daily Scrums to two or three times per week. This change can prevent the meetings from becoming monotonous and make them more dynamic and valuable. As teams become more experienced with Agile practices, they frequently communicate and collaborate to maintain project momentum, making daily meetings <span class="No-Break">less critical.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use a Kanban board</strong>: Integrating a Kanban board into the Daily Scrum process effectively illustrates the team’s workflow, the status of work, and the flow of value. The Kanban board efficiently addresses the three questions in the daily <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>meeting so the team can focus more on coordinating the day’s work and resolving impediments. This approach aligns well with Lean principles, emphasizing waste removal (in this case, unnecessary discussion) and <span class="No-Break">smooth flow.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use generic language</strong>: Due to differing views on best practices, terms, and the costs associated with training and certification, some organizations may resist adopting specific methodologies and terminology on a large scale. For example, what is typically known as a Daily Scrum could be called a sync meeting or whatever makes sense to your team. You can still implement Scrum’s practices without necessarily using its specific jargon—we encourage and support this adaptability if using specific jargon gets in the way of adoption and their supporting <span class="No-Break">value steams.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Use Lean-Agile principles to adapt the Daily Scrum for your context to enhance the effectiveness of it and other Agile events. The evolution of practices requires a mature understanding of Agile methods, emphasizing adaptability and <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement.</span></p>
			<h3>Conducting iteration reviews in Lean-Agile environments</h3>
			<p>In the Lean-Agile development environment, the <em class="italic">Sprint Review</em> concept undergoes a transformative shift. In BLAST, we prefer <em class="italic">iteration</em> over the term <em class="italic">Sprint</em>, though we often <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>use the terms interchangeably in this book. One reason is that the term <em class="italic">iteration</em> is independent of the team’s development approach. Also, the term <em class="italic">Sprint</em> has the suggestion of running a short but fast race, which is not our intent. Instead, our goal in each iteration is to deliver a new increments of value at a sustainable cadence. We also use the term <em class="italic">integrated increment</em> over increment to emphasize that the increment is fully integrated from a functional point of view across the teams involved, to fully support a <span class="No-Break">new release.</span></p>
			<p>Timeboxes establish the cadence at which we have agreed to deliver new increments of value. A metronome is a better analogy, as the iterations set the pace for our work and our deliveries. Therefore, the term <em class="italic">integrated increment</em> more accurately conveys the purpose of this timebox: to produce a new increment of customer-centered value through a new product or <span class="No-Break">value-stream enhancement.</span></p>
			<p>The review of the BLAST integrated increment at the end of each solution development cycle is a structured activity where customers, users, and other stakeholders assess the completeness of the integrated increments for release. For example, an integrated increment might focus on development work across two disparate information systems that simultaneously support changes to existing business processes. The integrated increment may also consist of transformed and migrated data, SQL queries, custom reports, job aids, training materials, and <span class="No-Break">related communications.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> illustrates the concept of an <span class="No-Break">integrated increment.</span></p>

			<p>The number of incremental releases and the overall timeline for completing the systems integration work are secondary concerns. Instead, the primary focus in MVR planning and BLAST planning is on achieving the increment’s goal through the completion of one or more MVIs. The increment’s goal provides a clear description of the minimum amount of business value that should be realized from the customer’s perspective, detailing all the components required for its release and the acceptance criteria that define <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>their definition of done. In other words, the MVI approach prioritizes delivering tangible, useful, and deployable value in each <span class="No-Break">development cycle.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, an MVR may include multiple MVIs and follow the same BLAST release cadence. We will explore the relevance of MVIs and MVRs later in this chapter, and again in <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Defining a Business Agility System for the </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Enterprise (BASE)</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Now, we will move on to discuss the use of team retrospectives in a <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile environment.</span></p>
			<h3>Enhancing retrospectives with value stream management</h3>
			<p>In a Lean-Agile organization, the approach to Sprint Retrospectives undergoes a significant <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>transformation. Spending time, money, and resources on non-value-added activities can be detrimental. Well-intentioned retrospectives that lead to local optimizations can harm BLAST performance, resulting in infighting, finger-pointing, fire-fighting, and employee burnout. This often occurs when changes or delivery objectives are dictated without considering their systemic impact. Therefore, in BLAST, we align retrospectives with VSM-based improvement strategies to focus on the most <span class="No-Break">impactful enhancements.</span></p>
			<p>Scrum retrospectives focus on what the development team can directly influence in the forthcoming sprint, aiming for immediate, iterative improvements within the team’s local authority and scope. This approach works well in small team settings where the scope is limited to the team’s control. However, in large, multi-team settings, individual team improvements can lead to local optimization, overlooking the broader system needs. So, to recap, team-based retrospectives are beneficial for making the team more effective and adaptable but are limited in their capacity for broader, systemic changes due to a lack of visibility and authority over the entire <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, Lean’s VSM practice mandates a broader perspective, examining the entire value stream from concept or request to customer delivery. This helps identify and prioritize enhancements that significantly impact overall flow, productivity, efficiency, and throughput. These improvements directly contribute to increased revenue, reduced costs, and <span class="No-Break">improved quality.</span></p>
			<p>Without systems thinking, optimizations may improve specific teams or processes but miss more impactful changes that benefit the entire value stream. If changes do not address the current bottleneck, considerable effort and resources might be expended with little to no perceptible benefit to customers or the organization. Therefore, VSM practitioners always look for the constraints that hinder flows. </p>
			<p>Let’s revisit a figure originally introduced in <a href="B21818_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a> as an example of the theory of constraints (see <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.3</em></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer102">
					<img alt="Figure 8.3 – Theory of constraints example" src="image/B21818_08_3.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.3 – Theory of constraints example</p>
			<p>As before, <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em> depicts a value stream comprising seven activities, each taking 5 minutes, with one exception: a central activity (A4) that requires 10 minutes. This lengthier <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>activity creates a bottleneck, causing a backlog of work in the steps leading up to it. Meanwhile, subsequent activities lack work, awaiting input from the bottlenecked step. The key issue is that fixing the bottleneck in activity A4 is the primary concern. If another team spends time, money, and effort on reducing their cycle time to 30 seconds, it will be for nothing, as A4 is still the bottleneck. Even with their change, the other six activities cannot support the flow rate of the revised value <span class="No-Break">stream activity.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, retrospectives in a Lean-Agile organization must be adapted to include a broader VSM perspective. This holistic view fosters a more comprehensive understanding of how value is delivered to customers. By integrating VSM thinking into retrospectives, teams are empowered to make immediate sprint-level improvements and contribute to broader, systemic changes that enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the organization’s <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we explained how reviews and communications operate differently in a <span class="No-Break">multi-team environment.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor404"/>Prioritizing value delivery in BLAST artifacts</h2>
			<p>BLAST <a id="_idIndexMarker632"/>stands out with its unique focus on delivering tangible value through its three signature <strong class="bold">artifacts</strong>: <strong class="bold">minimum viable product</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>), as defined by Eric Ries, <em class="italic">minimum valuable increment</em> (<em class="italic">MVI</em>), and <em class="italic">minimum valuable release</em> (<em class="italic">MVR</em>). These artifacts are <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>strategic milestones in the development process that ensure the delivery of actual value to customers while aligning with broader organizational goals. Let’s walk through these concepts one at <span class="No-Break">a time.</span></p>
			<h3>Minimum viable product (MVP)</h3>
			<p>The MVP in BLAST is a proven method emphasizing collaboration among integrated value stream teams to create an early version of a new product or service that allows a team to <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>validate a proposed concept or market opportunity. This MVP is a minimal and tangible representation of what can be built and delivered <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>over time. MVPs use an iterative process, allowing teams to gauge the product’s viability and adjust based on fast feedback. In his seminal book <em class="italic">The Lean Startup</em>, Eric Ries describes the MVP as a method to validate whether you have a product that customers need and, if so, what features are needed. In his follow-up book <em class="italic">The Startup Way</em>, Ries clarifies that MVPs are about addressing all assumptions. That is, MVPs are not just about exploring the product but all the assumptions about the whole product, its marketing, delivery, and <span class="No-Break">support.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-013"><span id="endnote-013-backlink">13</span></a>, <a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-014"><span id="endnote-014-backlink">14</span></a></span></span></p>
			<h3>Minimum valuable increment (MVI)</h3>
			<p>This is about delivering new increments of value within a product’s life cycle, from concept <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>to end of life. They often integrate <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>the efforts of multiple value stream teams to launch customer-centric products or services. This includes aligning strategies, securing funding, determining market demands, designing, developing, and testing, as well as deployment, promotion, sales, and support. MVIs ensure that each step adds value and aligns with <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<p>A key principle underpinning both the MVP and MVI is the focus on the rapid delivery of high-value features. However, the defining element of MVIs is that they represent the minimal value that customers expect to meet their needs, delivered in very granular slices. This granularity ensures that each increment is small enough to be quickly developed and deployed, allowing for frequent feedback and continuous improvement. This concept is consistent with Lean-oriented philosophies, which aim to eliminate waste and constraints on activities that customers do <span class="No-Break">not value.</span></p>
			<p>MVIs are <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>identified, prioritized, and refined in the business value backlog. Participating BLAST teams pull their work from the backlog in <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>order of highest priority. Priorities are set based on customers’ needs and to ensure that necessary elements to support future value-based deliveries are properly sequenced. Teams that pull lower-priority MVIs engage in a form of local optimization, which may be due to preferences or skills, and this hinders the organization’s ability to efficiently deliver the entire increment of value. On the other hand, we cannot expect a marketing team to work on software development tasks. In BLAST, teams pull work items from a single Business Value Backlog. But segmentation within the backlog is necessary to coordinate disparate pieces of work across value streams for each <span class="No-Break">release cycle.</span></p>
			<h3>Minimum valuable release (MVR)</h3>
			<p>While an MVI may offer functionality to customers, there are instances where bundling MVIs <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>together may be more advantageous. This bundling could serve multiple purposes: to reduce the overall transaction <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>cost of the release, to create a more significant functional impact from a marketing perspective, or to make it easier for customers to absorb new capabilities without feeling continuously overwhelmed by new features <span class="No-Break">and functions.</span></p>
			<p>When transaction costs, whether to the customer or the releasing company, are high, bundling MVIs together may be warranted. Additionally, if a larger impact is desired, multiple MVIs may need to be bundled as an integrated solution. Therefore, BLAST implements the MVR concept to coordinate the release of new functions, features, and processes on a planned cadence. Further details on how this works will be explored in the next chapter, <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Defining a Business Agility System for the </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Enterprise (BASE)</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>A significant advantage of BLAST, whether you are working on MVPs, MVIs, or MVRs, is the alignment it creates, enabling quick feedback cycles at low cost. In short, BLAST’s MVPs and MVIs ensure that value delivery remains at the forefront, bridging the gap between development ambitions and tangible <span class="No-Break">customer benefits.</span></p>
			<p>This concludes our discussion on BLAST’s three artifacts: MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs. This also wraps up our look at the foundational concepts and basic elements of the BLAST Framework, which, in recap, includes marshaling the work of multiple Lean-Agile teams across <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>seventeen steps in four Core Domains of Work, with three supporting roles and three delivery artifacts. The artifacts are the deliverables <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>produced by the BLAST teams to support the incremental release of value by the enterprise to its customers via the BASE Framework, which we will discuss in the next chapter, <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Defining a Business Agility System for the Enterprise (BASE)</em>. But we have more to cover in this chapter, so let’s continue by discussing the rhythms and cadences needed to support <span class="No-Break">value-based deliveries.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor405"/>Optimizing Development Cadences and Value Deliveries</h1>
			<p>Cadences in Lean and Agile environments are not new concepts. Agile uses an Iterative and Incremental Development (IID) model to establish a rapid development and delivery cadence, exemplified by the Sprints in Scrum. In contrast, Lean focuses on value stream flows, with a <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>production goal to establish a cadence that matches takt time. The German word <em class="italic">takt</em> means pulse or beat, conceptually aiming to align production capacities with <span class="No-Break">customer demands.</span></p>
			<p>This is where we begin to see inconsistencies between Scrum and Lean concepts of cadence. For instance, the Scrum Guide suggests a fixed length for Sprints of one month or less, emphasizing consistency in whatever length you choose. In contrast, Lean flows can vary significantly, being much quicker or longer depending on the size and complexity of the development effort. For example, tasks in a modern CI/CD line might be measured in seconds, minutes, or hours, while a Lean production line building large aircraft or ships might be measured in months to years. Moreover, in a Lean environment, takt time dynamically changes based on <span class="No-Break">customer demands.</span></p>
			<p>Synchronizing the concepts of cadence in a Lean-Agile environment becomes a critical concern, and this section shows you how to address it. As a preliminary hint, Lean-Agile organizations establish cadences across <span class="No-Break">planning horizons.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor406"/>Emphasizing customer centricity in Lean-Agile cadences</h2>
			<p>Both Scrum and BLAST underscore the paramount importance of the customer. Just as Scrum <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>begins with a product backlog, ordered by priority user stories and features, BLAST incorporates a Business Value Backlog that emphasizes the customer journey, placing customer needs and perceptions at <span class="No-Break">the forefront.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Scrum Guide and SAFe® Distilled</p>
			<p class="callout">The Scrum Guide at <a href="http://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html</a> offers more information about sprints and their events, so we needn’t repeat them here. Additionally, you may find <em class="italic">SAFe Distilled 5.0: Achieving Business Agility with the Scaled Agile Framework</em>, authored by Richard Knaster and Dean Leffingwell, an invaluable resource for applying Scrum in a multi-team, scaled environment. It also includes a detailed overview of the Scrum events integrated with <span class="No-Break">Lean concepts.</span></p>
			<p>While Scrum operates with distinct Sprint cycles that incorporate feedback through demos and retrospectives at the end of each cycle, BLAST takes a more continuous approach. Operating as a closed-loop system, BLAST persistently assesses customer needs to guide backlog items and priorities iteratively across a product’s economically viable lifecycle, ensuring ongoing alignment with value delivery. This mutual emphasis underscores the shared belief that understanding customer requirements <span class="No-Break">is paramount.</span></p>
			<p>The iterative approach of Agile is reflected in BLAST’s dedication to continuous delivery cycles. While BLAST’s Timeboxed Teams operate in Scrum-like sprint cycles, there is a key difference. Although Scrum incorporates lean principles to minimize waste, it doesn’t fully encompass the Lean concept of flow. In fact, it’s easy to argue that Scrum implements a batch process, as the sprint backlog items flow in and out as a batch at the beginning and end of each iteration of the Sprint’s <span class="No-Break">set cadence.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, lean flow concepts emphasize smooth and continuous value delivery with minimal delays or friction. BLAST ensures value is delivered efficiently and mitigates common bottlenecks in traditional development. This commi<a id="_idTextAnchor407"/>tment to flow reinforces BLAST’s comprehensive approach to integrating Lean and <span class="No-Break">Agile practices.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we will examine more closely how development and production cycles, as disparate but equally important cadences, work in a Lean-Agile <span class="No-Break">work environment.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor408"/>Embracing Lean flows in modern software development</h2>
			<p>As noted in the introduction to this subsection, the Scrum Guide specifies that a sprint is a <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>fixed-length event of one month or less.<span class="superscript"> <a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-015"><span id="endnote-015-backlink">15</span></a></span> This recommended duration has not changed. What has changed is the speed of software development due to integrated toolchains and automation <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>capabilities enabled by CI/CD and DevOps pipelines, along with <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">microservices-based architectures</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>For example, the <em class="italic">Google DORA Accelerate State of DevOps Report 2023 </em>underscores a stark divide in deployment capabilities across performance tiers. Elite performers in DevOps achieve on demand deployment frequencies, maintain a lead time for changes of less than one day have a change failure rate of 5%, and restore service in less than one hour. In stark contrast, low performers deploy on weekly to monthly intervals, grapple with a daunting 64% failure rate, and face failed deployment recovery times that can stretch to an alarming six months.<span class="superscript"> <a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-016"><span id="endnote-016-backlink">16</span></a></span> This gap underscores the differences between top-tier developers, who are well versed in the latest software development methods, test automation, and integrated toolchains, and their peers in the lower tier, who may not have fully embraced <span class="No-Break">these advancements.</span></p>
			<p>While the pace and efficiency of software development have undergone profound transformations, it’s pivotal to recalibrate our understanding of the purpose of sprints within Agile. As originally conceived, Scrum sprints do not map directly to the end-to-end development cycles typical of Lean-oriented product delivery flows. Instead, they serve a foundational role by providing a consistent cadence for teams to prioritize, plan, execute, and reflect on their work. This rhythm ensures that teams can align their efforts with business needs regularly, make necessary adjustments based on feedback, and deliver <span class="No-Break">incremental value.</span></p>
			<p>So, while Lean emphasizes efficient flows, notably enhanced through integrated systems, tools, and workflow automation, Agile underscores the value of iterative and incremental planning and execution cycles. Thus, in the BLAST framework, the intrinsic nature of a sprint as a cycle of planning and execution remains unchanged, even as the overall delivery speed and flow <span class="No-Break">efficiency improve.</span></p>
			<p>As we’ve explored the evolving dynamics of software development, it’s evident that rhythms and flows are central to modern Lean-Agile practices. With this foundation, we can now fully explore the importance of embracing these rhythms and cadences to harness the power of the <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile enterprise.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor409"/>Pursuing a new model for value delivery</h2>
			<p>In Lean-Agile enterprises, value delivery relies on multiple cadences that span from overarching <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>strategic work to daily operations. The next subsection dives deeper into the planning and execution cycles, highlighting their significance in a successful <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile enterprise.</span></p>
			<p>To fully understand the Lean-Agile approach to product deliveries, we need a model that illustrates the progression from an idea’s inception to its actualization as a process, product, or service. We will get to that model a bit later in this section. Before we get to that, let’s introduce some <span class="No-Break">basic concepts.</span></p>
			<p>An integrated Lean-Agile delivery process is anchored in corporate strategy and shaped by market demands and customer insights. Initially, we might be inundated with business and product ideas, but many might not see the light of day. Meanwhile, modern DevOps pipelines enhance software development and delivery capabilities through integrated toolchains and automation. Consequently, the gap between defining requirements and delivering on them has only broadened. The good news is that the BLAST approach clarifies the mechanisms to achieve an efficient software <span class="No-Break">delivery ecosystem.</span></p>
			<p>Conceptually, we can employ a funnel metaphor to illustrate how the <em class="italic">inception phase</em> for products, services, or business-supporting processes, systems, and artifacts might brim with potential avenues to explore. However, factors such as time, resources, risks, and market dynamics will whittle down these options. Initially, we won’t know what products and services we need to deliver, nor the capabilities, features, and functions required. Everything is still fuzzy at this stage. Recognizing this uncertainty is essential to ensure a steady, productive supply to our <span class="No-Break">DevOps pipelines.</span></p>
			<p>To manage this flow of requirements effectively, we utilize different <em class="italic">planning horizons</em>. These horizons help us structure our approach to requirements assessment and refinement. Long-term planning horizons focus on aligning with corporate strategy and market demands, establishing high-level goals and objectives. Mid-term planning horizons translate these goals into tangible work items, prioritized within backlogs. Short-term planning horizons ensure that teams have well-defined, actionable tasks ready for development. This structured approach ensures that as ideas move through the funnel, they are continuously refined and aligned with strategic objectives, enhancing the efficiency of our <span class="No-Break">delivery processes.</span></p>
			<p>However, defining value through a series of planning horizons isn’t exclusive to supporting modern software delivery capabilities. Executives are constantly bombarded with investment ideas to support the business, but there are usually insufficient financial and human resources to pursue every request. Therefore, the organization needs a planning process to properly vet, prioritize, and fund the initiatives that drive the most value. This section fundamentally focuses on defining planning processes to support <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>these vetting and refinement activities. Here, you will learn how to implement the multi-faceted rhythms that drive enterprises holistically across all domains. In a Lean-Agile context, we refer to these rhythms <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">cadences</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>We noted that business and product requirements are fuzzy in the early stages of planning. This issue is so significant that we have a name for it: <strong class="bold">the </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">fuzzy front-end</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Taming the fuzzy front-end</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">fuzzy front-end</strong> (<strong class="bold">FFE</strong>), a term <a id="_idIndexMarker650"/>coined by Smith and Reinertsen in their book <em class="italic">Developing Products in Half the Time</em>, describes the initial, often <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>opaque stages of requirements discovery and refinement and how they pose a unique challenge in software development.<span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-017"><span id="endnote-017-backlink">17</span></a></span> This phase may have high uncertainty, require continuous exploration, and cannot be easily automated. Requirements identification, analysis, and prioritization are just as challenging now as in 1998 when Smith and Reinertsen published <span class="No-Break">their book.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll revisit this concept frequently throughout the remainder of this chapter. For the moment, let’s turn our attention back to the topic of cadences. We have already touched on this briefly, but we will explore how these cadences extend across various planning horizons, i<a id="_idTextAnchor410"/>mpacting every facet of <span class="No-Break">business domains.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor411"/>Mastering Lean-Agile Planning and Delivery Cadences</h2>
			<p>This subsection <a id="_idIndexMarker652"/>explains the strategic importance of planning cadences within Lean-Agile enterprises. While iterative planning may seem outdated in today’s fast-paced, Lean-Agile environments characterized by continuous flow and rapid delivery, these cadences remain vital for organizations seeking to build and maintain their <span class="No-Break">competitive edge.</span></p>
			<p>Frequent cadence-based planning ensures that organizations can respond swiftly to market demands by consistently replenishing their development pipelines with customer-oriented products, service enhancements, and business process and systems improvements. Moreover, such planning fosters synchronization across multiple teams, promoting alignment and cross-functional coordination, including the management of team dependencies <span class="No-Break">and integrations.</span></p>
			<p>As you work your way through this subsection, refer to <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> for more details on the iterative <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>planning increments necessary to support a modern Lean-Agile software delivery pipeline employing highly integrated and automated CI/CD and DevOps toolchains. These planning processes and horizon concepts apply equally to evaluating all business <span class="No-Break">investment opportunities.</span></p>

			<h3>Streamlining backlog refinement</h3>
			<p>We previously introduced the <em class="italic">fuzzy front-end</em> concept as a critical factor in successfully conducting <a id="_idIndexMarker654"/>product requirements analysis. This inception phase represents the initial requirements capture process that resists simplification through automation or systems engineering. In software development organizations, if not effectively addressed, this phase can lead to a shortage of work in the backlog necessary to support highly efficient and accelerated DevOps software development pipelines, starving those lines <span class="No-Break">of work.</span></p>
			<p>Organizations start addressing their fuzzy front-ends with <em class="italic">Corporate Strategy</em> and <em class="italic">Portfolio Management</em> activities to establish high-level goals and objectives. However, strategy is not limited to the C-Suite. The function of product management is to have a strategy-level responsibility to refine the executive’s product ambitions into tangible work items, usually expressed as epics. Their efforts initiate the <em class="italic">Backlog </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Refinement</em></span><span class="No-Break"> process.</span></p>
			<p>As noted in the <em class="italic">MVI planning (steps 3 and 4)</em> section, an epic is a large body of work that can <a id="_idIndexMarker655"/>be broken down into smaller sets of requirements in the form of user and technical stories. Epics may span multiple iterations or sprints and encompass a significant feature or requirement that delivers substantial business value <span class="No-Break">once completed.</span></p>
			<p>Value managers and product owners support the <em class="italic">BLAST increment planning</em> process to ensure the epics are decomposed into stories, refined, and prioritized for delivery. They also work with the BLAST teams to plan and provide guidance during the <span class="No-Break">integrated increments.</span></p>
			<p>Developers are responsible for assisting in the refinement process and defining the tasks necessary to build and deliver the solution components. Intentional design and architecture activities must start much earlier during backlog refinement and BLAST increment <span class="No-Break">planning phases.</span></p>
			<p>The concept of backlog refinement in BLAST goes beyond Scrum practices as starting the process earlier is even more important in a highly efficient Lean-Agile organization. Moreover, managing requirements in large enterprises or complex solutions often begins far in advance of <span class="No-Break">actual development.</span></p>
			<h3>Managing ideas and innovations</h3>
			<p>Using the funnel idea previously illustrated in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em>, we conceptualize the refinement <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>process as starting with a broad set of potential value stream processes, product ideas, and infrastructure development options, which are then iteratively narrowed down through successive <span class="No-Break">planning increments.</span></p>
			<p>However, many ideas in the funnel will be discarded or delayed due to cost and priority considerations. This does not necessarily mean they are poor ideas; rather, they may not be relevant in the current timeframe. It is useful to envision our funnel as having leaks where certain ideas and concepts escape our immediate attention. To ensure these ideas are not lost, we can also imagine a drain pan underneath the funnel to catch them for reference at a <span class="No-Break">later date.</span></p>
			<p>Managing these innovative ideas for future consideration requires a structured approach. This is where the concept of an <em class="italic">InnovationOps database</em> comes into play, serving as <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>the foundation for building and managing a centralized system designed to track innovation-related projects, activities, and data within an organization. While InnovationOps is a crucial aspect of innovation management, a detailed discussion of its implementation is beyond the scope of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<h3>Facilitating collaboration and planning during BLAST increments</h3>
			<p>During the planning and execution phases of the BLAST integrated increments, key players such <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>as the <strong class="bold">value manager</strong> (<strong class="bold">product owner</strong>), <strong class="bold">UI/UX developers</strong>, and <strong class="bold">lead developers</strong> engage in deep collaboration. They address critical tasks <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>encompassing usability, design, infrastructure, and architectural <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>considerations. This collaboration also extends to defining user stories and acceptance criteria, and developing UI prototypes for reviewers <a id="_idIndexMarker661"/>to evaluate before development begins. This preparatory stage is essential, as these refinements are instrumental in establishing a solid foundation for the upcoming team-based <span class="No-Break">planning sessions.</span></p>
			<p>When it comes time for the development teams to take over, their planning events are designed to be succinct, typically spanning just a few hours. This streamlined planning is only feasible if the preliminary product planning increment work has been thorough. With the refinement details already in hand, development teams can then concentrate on determining the specific tasks and workload for the upcoming BLAST increment, assigning tasks, and clarifying the build requirements and acceptance criteria. It’s a straightforward principle: an item from the business value backlog that has not been refined cannot be slated for an upcoming BLAST <span class="No-Break">increment’s backlog.</span></p>
			<p>This systematic approach ensures that our development pipeline is consistently fed with well-defined, ready-to-work items, preventing delays in the continuous flow of customer value. By refining the backlog ahead of the integrated increments, we empower our teams to maintain the momentum for Lean-Agile success, fostering a sustainable cycle of delivery that meets and exceeds competitive <span class="No-Break">market demands.</span></p>
			<p>In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em>, there was a note that the fuzzy front end is difficult to predict, estimate, and automate. Not much has changed since Don Reinertsen coined this term in his 1985 article <em class="italic">Blitzkrieg Product Development: Cut Development Time in Half</em>. However, some strides are being made to address these concerns by <span class="No-Break">utilizing AI.</span></p>
			<h3>Embracing AI in discovery</h3>
			<p>The requirements discovery process is evolving with the help of AI and ML. While AI-based <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>decision-making introduces uncertainties, leveraging <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>algorithms to analyze data and predict outcomes enhances efficiency. Striking a balance between utilizing AI’s power and maintaining human oversight <span class="No-Break">is essential.</span></p>
			<p>Here are <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>some examples of how AI is being used to address <a id="_idIndexMarker665"/>the challenges of requirements analysis in <span class="No-Break">software development:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Natural language <span class="No-Break">processing (NLP)</span></li>
				<li>Automated <span class="No-Break">requirements extraction</span></li>
				<li>Consistency <span class="No-Break">and conflict-checking</span></li>
				<li>Prioritization and <span class="No-Break">impact analysis</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Predictive analytics</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Requirements validation</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These AI applications enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of requirements analysis in software development. Still, the black-box nature of some AI models raises questions about transparency, interpretability, and accountability. Organizations must navigate this landscape carefully, embracing AI’s potential while mitigating risks. Ultimately, the synergy between human intuition and AI-driven insights will shape the future of requirements gathering <span class="No-Break">and innovation.</span></p>
			<p>We’ve covered the planning cadences needed to effectively transform strategies and ideas into actionable work items. Now, let’s get a clearer picture of the time and <span class="No-Break">effort involved.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>Exploring planning horizons</h2>
			<p>In product development and continuous improvement, organizations consistently face the challenge <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>of navigating the ambiguous fuzzy front-end of requirements analysis. As ideas emerge and take form, they naturally evolve from abstract concepts to concrete plans. Without a structured approach, this transition can become chaotic, leading to misaligned efforts and <span class="No-Break">missed opportunities.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">It’s essential to add an Agile perspective to planning horizons. For mature processes, systems, products, and services, new customer and business requirements can quickly emerge with high priority. If these changes fit within the approved strategy and portfolio investments, the product management function can expedite them by assigning high priority to the business <span class="No-Break">value backlog.</span></p>
			<p>To address this challenge, it is essential to adopt a planning methodology that leverages planning cadences, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em>. This approach not only streamlines the development process but also guarantees that value stream improvement initiatives stay attuned to what truly matters for end users, and teams are building the right thing at the <span class="No-Break">right time.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.5 – Enterprise planning horizons</p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em> presents an expanded, timeboxed view that builds on the funnel idea introduced in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em>. This diagram illustrates a clear sequence of planning that enhances the organization’s ability to deliver products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<p>With that concern addressed, let’s examine the planning horizons depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.5</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product Roadmap and Portfolio Investments</strong><strong class="bold"> </strong><strong class="bold">(longer term, 1-3+ years ahead)</strong>: Executives maintain the product roadmap, outlining future investments (products and services) vital for achieving the organization’s strategic goals. Simultaneously, portfolio management determines the investments needed to support <span class="No-Break">those offerings.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business Value Assessments (mid-term planning within the current fiscal year)</strong>: Converting strategy into actionable plans, product and marketing managers <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>undertake research and collaborate with industry experts, clients, and development teams. Their goal is to identify, define, and prioritize products and services for the business <span class="No-Break">value backlog.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Business and technical architects support this phase by providing preliminary assessments of process, system, infrastructure, and <span class="No-Break">architecture needs.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increment Plan (short-term planning, 8-12 weeks ahead)</strong>: Entering a tactical implementation phase, the value manager (product owner), with input from design and development teams, refines the work items in the backlog in collaboration with stakeholders <span class="No-Break">and clients.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team plans (1-4 weeks out)</strong>: As the requirements become refined and prioritized in the backlog, the development teams need time to assess the requirements and define the tasks to build the <span class="No-Break">work items.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Daily plans</strong>: Schedule frequent meetings, as needed, during BLAST solution construction periods to check progress against goals and address any challenges hindering progress. Timebox these meetings to no more than 15 minutes and avoid turning them into working sessions. Hold working <span class="No-Break">sessions separately.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Looking back at <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em>, we can see the interconnected nature of these cadences. Each has a vital role in the development of products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<p>The following subsection discusses integrated increments and their importance in synchronizing multiple Lean-Agile teams and multiple BLASTs operating across varied business domains. These concepts are key to understand before we delve into the next chapter, <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Defining a Business Agility System for the </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Enterprise (BASE)</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>Facilitating collaboration at scale – the team-of-teams approach</h2>
			<p>In Lean-Agile enterprises, the sheer scale and complexity of business operations can present <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>challenges in ensuring seamless collaboration and alignment across teams. The concept of a team of teams seeks to address this by creating a structured ToT <span class="No-Break">collaboration mechanism.</span></p>
			<p>At the heart of this approach are representatives from individual teams. Previously, we mentioned several scaled Scrum methods that implement similar roles, such as the Ambassador in Scrum of Scrums™ and NITs in the Nexus™ framework. Regardless of what you choose to call them, these representatives come together at periodic intervals, linking disparate teams and forming a collaborative entity that ensures enterprise-wide collaboration. This ToT communications structure facilitates the management of dependencies, seamless integrations, and maintains synchronization across all teams involved. The benefits of this structure include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Addressing dependencies</strong>: As teams work on interrelated tasks, issues related to dependencies, integration, and synchronization inevitably arise. Representatives in the team-of-teams structure ensure these issues are identified early and managed effectively, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring <span class="No-Break">smooth delivery.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ensuring ToTs integration</strong>: Integration points are critical in large-scale projects. BLAST’s ToT planning and review sessions should be scheduled with qualified representatives from each team to resolve business and technical <span class="No-Break">integration issues.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Aligning/coordinating efforts</strong>: Coordination becomes vital when multiple teams work toward common goals. The team-of-teams approach ensures a synchronized effort, with teams aware of each other’s progress, challenges, and upcoming milestones. Coordination tends to be expensive and error-prone. The BLAST framework implements a shared business value backlog to improve the alignment of work and work item prioritization across <span class="No-Break">the BLAST.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Shared learning and best practices</strong>: Representatives can share learnings, challenges faced, and best practices adopted by their teams. This collective wisdom improves efficiency and fosters a culture of <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Risk mitigation</strong>: Discussing challenges and potential risks at the team-of-teams <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>level can address issues proactively, ensuring that individual teams don’t face <span class="No-Break">unexpected roadblocks.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Frequent communication</strong>: Regular and clear communication among team members and stakeholders is vital for aligning goals, sharing progress, and addressing any <span class="No-Break">concerns promptly.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement</strong>: Teams should regularly review their processes and outcomes to identify opportunities for improvement and implement necessary changes for better efficiency <span class="No-Break">and effectiveness.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>BLAST does not define a precise role or set of responsibilities for these representatives. This is because the number and skills of representatives will constantly change in a Lean-Agile organization depending upon the domains and skills involved and the business context of <span class="No-Break">the discussions.</span></p>
			<p>To clarify their role, you may choose to call these BLAST representatives <em class="italic">BLAST coordinators</em>, or simply <em class="italic">coordinators</em>; their collaborative working sessions <em class="italic">BLAST meets</em>; and their socialization networks <em class="italic">BLAST hubs</em>. However, the choice is yours. Feel free to refer to the representatives and their meetings as you prefer. In short, BLAST implements <em class="italic">coordinators</em>, <em class="italic">meets</em>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">hubs</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In the next subsection, we’ll take a closer look at several common types of issues addressed by the <span class="No-Break">BLAST coordinators.</span></p>
			<h3>Ensuring Seamless Project Delivery</h3>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker670"/>chapter, and later chapters, we frequently mention that teams and individuals working in a team-of-teams environment must address dependencies, integration, and synchronization issues that arise from managing work across across-team tasks. Let’s take a moment to define how these issues manifest <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>in a BLAST or multi-BLAST <span class="No-Break">work environment:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cross-team tasks</strong>: Tasks that are connected or dependent on each other in <span class="No-Break">some way</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dependencies</strong>: Situations where one task relies on the completion of <span class="No-Break">another task</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration issues</strong>: Challenges that arise when combining different components or systems to <span class="No-Break">work together</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Synchronization issues</strong>: Problems that occur when coordinating the timing and sequencing of tasks to ensure they work <span class="No-Break">together seamlessly</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By focusing on these critical areas, BLAST teams can enhance their collaboration, minimize <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>obstacles, and drive successful project outcomes, ultimately achieving their strategic goals. The BLAST coordinator approach acts as a bridge, ensuring that while individual teams retain their autonomy and focus, a higher-level collaboration mechanism keeps the entire enterprise aligned, integrated, and moving <span class="No-Break">forward cohesively.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll discuss BLAST roles in an upcoming section. But first, we need to understand the concept of increments in BLAST and how they support the life cycles of a process, business system, product, <span class="No-Break">or service.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor414"/>Understanding increments in life cycle management</h2>
			<p>In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>, the term <em class="italic">increments</em>, and more precisely <em class="italic">increment planning</em>, stands out as a <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>cornerstone of product life cycle management. Typically spanning 8-12 weeks, this period involves the value manager (or product owner) actively collaborating <a id="_idIndexMarker674"/>with stakeholders to refine requirements for near-term enhancements across the business’s processes, systems, products, <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<p>However, the value manager’s role goes beyond merely ensuring the delivery of what customers desire. They also evaluate value through a Lean lens, aiming to eliminate waste, remove constraints, and <span class="No-Break">enhance flow.</span></p>
			<p>As we’ll learn in the next section, a product owner’s role is not just about embedding desired features; delivering them swiftly and cost-effectively is equally critical. This requires improvements to the organization’s value streams. In this context, we prefer to think of the role as a <em class="italic">value delivery manager</em> or <em class="italic">value manager</em>, rather than just a <span class="No-Break">product owner.</span></p>
			<p>The significance <a id="_idIndexMarker675"/>of increments in the Lean approach extends beyond product development-oriented value streams. The release of new business and customer value often necessitates the orchestration of efforts across multiple domains and value streams, underscoring the comprehensive nature of <span class="No-Break">this concept.</span></p>
			<p>This concludes our discussion on the implementation of Lean-Agile cadences. Now we move on to a discussion on Lean-Agile <span class="No-Break">management practices.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor415"/>Embracing Lean-Agile management practices</h1>
			<p>Management, often <a id="_idIndexMarker676"/>misunderstood in Agile contexts, holds a multi-faceted role in Lean-Agile work environments, which includes <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improving work environments</strong>: Creating a conducive environment for teams <span class="No-Break">to flourish</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resource allocation</strong>: Ensuring teams hav<a id="_idTextAnchor416"/>e the necessary people, resources, <span class="No-Break">and information</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">People development</strong>: Offering career guidance <span class="No-Break">and self-improvement</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collaboration</strong>: Coordinating with peers to ensure <span class="No-Break">cross-functional efficiency</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fiduciary responsibility to shareholders</strong>: Management also has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company’s shareholders, ensuring that decisions and actions align with long-term value creation and <span class="No-Break">sustainable growth</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A primary perspective for management in Lean-Agile work environments is recognizing the knowledge and expertise of team members actively involved in tasks. Trusting your teams and individuals is crucial, but it should be balanced with oversight to prevent <span class="No-Break">potential issues.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor417"/>Championing Lean-Agile management</h2>
			<p>W. Edwards Deming aptly said, “<em class="italic">A system must be managed. It will not manage itself</em>.” In an organization, management is the backbone, bridging the strategic vision with the hands-on execution at the Gemba or workplace. They play a central role in aligning organizational goals with actual execution, a concept termed <span class="No-Break">middle-up-down management.</span></p>
			<p>Often perceived <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>as obstacles in Lean-Agile transitions, middle managers can be catalysts for positive change. Their position uniquely positions them to translate overarching strategies into actionable activities, making them vital in transformations and the continuous success of Lean-Agile methods. They communicate strategic visions while also integrating insights from <span class="No-Break">frontline operations.</span></p>
			<p>In BLAST’s transformation model, middle management doesn’t just oversee the change but actively participates in it, becoming pioneers of the evolving <span class="No-Break">leadership dynamics.</span></p>
			<p>All managers must embrace and champion Lean-Agile practices. Management must take time to understand the issues workers face and ensure a respectful approach focusing on inclusivity <span class="No-Break">and cooperation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor418"/>Harnessing middle management for organizational agility</h2>
			<p>Scrum, first <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>introduced in 1993 by Jeff Sutherland, John Scumniotales, and Jeff McKenna at <strong class="bold">Easel Corporation</strong>, was inspired by the HBR article <em class="italic">The New New Product Development Game</em> (1986) by Takeuchi and Nonaka, which drew parallels between new development strategies and a game <span class="No-Break">of rugby.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-018"><span id="endnote-018-backlink">18</span></a></span></span></p>
			<p>The foundational principles of <em class="italic">Middle-Up-Down Management</em> were detailed in Nonaka’s 1988 work <em class="italic">Toward Middle-Up-Down Management: Accelerating Information Creation</em>. <span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-019"><span id="endnote-019-backlink">19</span></a></span> This management approach merges the systematic processing of information—a characteristic of established organizations—with the dynamic information creation typical in Agile entities. Central to this is middle management’s role in guiding organizational transformations aligned with <span class="No-Break">business objectives.</span></p>
			<p>Distinctly, the Lean-Agile aspects of BLAST acknowledge and embrace this core aspect of Lean management. In the Lean philosophy, management is viewed as a vital, positive force, not a blocker of progress. This concludes the section on embracing Lean-Agile management practices. Before we end the chapter, let’s understand the history <span class="No-Break">of BLAST.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor419"/>Tracing BLAST’s history</h1>
			<p>BLAST was conceptualized in 2008 during an engagement by Al Shalloway with a client that was using Scrum effectively but couldn’t deliver quickly. Although the teams were working on <a id="_idIndexMarker679"/>the same product, they operated independently and only attempted integration every two weeks. This led to long final <span class="No-Break">integration times.</span></p>
			<p>By viewing the work as a single value stream instead of separate Agile-based teams, it was quickly determined that a common backlog would create alignment and facilitate full integration after each sprint. The BLAST approach eliminated the need for extensive coordination, expedited integrations, and provided quick feedback across <span class="No-Break">the teams.</span></p>
			<p>This real-world example demonstrates how BLAST can transform team operations and significantly enhance efficiency and delivery speed. Today, this approach also better accommodates the highly accelerated software deliveries enabled via CI/CD and <span class="No-Break">DevOps toolchains.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note:</p>
			<p class="callout">The terms BLAST and BASE were coined by authors Al Shalloway and Gary Rupp in joint working sessions in <span class="No-Break">May 2022.</span></p>
			<p>This brings us to the end of this chapter. But before we move on, let’s summarize what you <span class="No-Break">have learned.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor420"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter presented BLAST as a framework and guide to integrating the efficiency of Lean with the adaptability of Agile. Recognizing the imperative of evolving business needs, we discussed how BLAST enhances Agile methodologies, providing an actionable approach from concept to realization. We reviewed the intricacies of harnessing BLAST and its differences from and similarities with Scrum models, as well as gaining an understanding of its roles <span class="No-Break">and artifacts.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding and implementing BLAST is critical for organizations aiming to stay competitive. It ensures timely value delivery at <span class="No-Break">minimized costs.</span></p>
			<p>Looking ahead, in <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Defining a Business Agility System for the Enterprise (BASE)</em>, we’ll transition into the product life cycle in Lean-Agile practices. The focus will be on the development of MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs. The BASE framework defines a systematic cycle of events, ensuring iterative and incremental value delivery through continuous process improvements and product enhancements. You will also learn how BASE facilitates cross-value <span class="No-Break">strea<a id="_idTextAnchor421"/>m teamwork.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor422"/>Questions</h1>

				<li>What are the three artifacts in the <span class="No-Break">BLAST framework?</span></li>
				<li>True or false: the BLAST framework has <span class="No-Break">17 events.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor424"/>Answers</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The three aspects of Lean management are traditional hierarchies may remain, leading by example, and <span class="No-Break">focused decision-making.</span></li>
				<li>The management concepts typified in Agile-based practices include flatter structures, distributed decision-making, servant leadership, and continuous <span class="No-Break">feedback loops.</span></li>
				<li>The steps defining the customer-centric foundations of the BLAST framework are customer centricity (step 1) and business value backlog (<span class="No-Break">step 2).</span></li>
				<li>The BLAST framework steps that define planning, refinement, and commitment activities are MVR refinement (step 3), BLAST planning (step 4), and commitment backlog (<span class="No-Break">step 5).</span></li>
				<li>The BLAST framework concepts for Lean-Agile workflow integrations are flow teams and timeboxed teams (steps 6 and 7), daily reviews and review and refinement of workflow tracks (steps 9 and 10), and BLAST integrations (steps 10 <span class="No-Break">and 11).</span></li>
				<li>The three BLAST framework concept steps for evaluating and enhancing product deliverables are integrated increments and integrated increment reviews (steps 12 and 13), feedback and pivot (step 14), and BLAST improvements to CX (steps 15 <span class="No-Break">to 17).</span></li>
				<li>The fuzzy front-end is important for the <span class="No-Break">following reasons:</span><p class="list-inset">Popularized by Preston Smith and Donald Reinertsen in 1991, the fuzzy front-end refers to a period of ambiguity when determining what needs to be built. Besides requiring more time than we might like, as ideas emerge and take form, there’s a natural evolution from abstract concepts to concrete plans. Without a structured approach, this transition can become chaotic, leading to misaligned efforts and <span class="No-Break">missed opportunities.</span></p></li>
				<li>The three BLAST framework roles are value manager, developer, <span class="No-Break">and coach.</span></li>
				<li>The three BLAST framework artifacts are <strong class="bold">minimum viable product</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>), <strong class="bold">minimum valuable increment</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVI</strong>), and <strong class="bold">minimum valuable </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">release</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">MVR</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li>False. However, this is a bit of a trick question. BLAST does not include the concept of events. Instead, BLAST has 17 steps. Unlike Scrum, which uses the term events, BLAST uses the term steps to imply action <span class="No-Break">and progress.</span></li>
