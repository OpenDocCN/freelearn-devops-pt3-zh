			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>The Tools to Take Your DevOps to the Next Level</h1>
			<p class="author-quote">I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your persons or your properties, but and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Socrates</p>
			<p>Alright, here we are, the final chapter, the final stop on our journey together in this book. It has been fun; I hope you’ve learned a few things – I certainly have experienced a lot of joy in teaching you and trying to help you in your journey. This whole book has been a journey for me as well. We will now conclude with a few tools that will help you further your journey into DevOps and Python on <span class="No-Break">your own.</span></p>
			<p>Consider this chapter to be an epilogue: a quick perusal of everything that has happened over the course of this book and a recap of all your learnings put into a functional context. In <em class="itali">The Lord of the Rings</em>, when the war is over, we see all of the characters have their individual endings of how their lives continued. That is my aim with this chapter, to leave you with something that rouses your curiosity and encourages you to walk even further down this path of DevOps and learn for yourselves what you <span class="No-Break">can achieve.</span></p>
			<p>On a personal note, I can say that over the course of writing this book, I have changed in many ways as well. The concepts of collaboration that I have preached throughout this book have come to help me greatly in collaborating with all of the wonderful people who have made this book possible. It has helped me level up in a way, and has pushed the boundaries of my ability and made me understand the responsibility of being <span class="No-Break">an author.</span></p>
			<p>The journeys that we undertake change us, mostly for the better. They make us confront who we are and what we want to do. The journey that I undertook writing this book has made me appreciative of the knowledge I had beforehand and the knowledge that I gained during the research of this book. It has made me a professional writer, and while this book won’t be as big a part of your life as it was mine, I hope it has helped facilitate your journey <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>So, for the final time, in this chapter, you will learn about <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Advanced automation tools that will allow you to make even more complex automation into <span class="No-Break">a reality</span></li>
				<li>Advanced monitoring tools to combine your monitoring and data analysis workloads and use <span class="No-Break">both skills</span></li>
				<li>Advanced event response strategies for when those events and alerts really get out <span class="No-Break">of hand</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow along with this chapter, you will require <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Grafana account <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="http://grafana.com"><span class="No-Break">grafana.com</span></a></li>
				<li>An AWS account with the ability to use AWS Step Functions and <span class="No-Break">Compute Engine</span></li>
				<li>A GitHub account to use the code in this book’s <span class="No-Break">repository (</span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Python-for-DevOps"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Python-for-DevOps</span></a><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>A Google Cloud Platform project with Google Kubernetes <span class="No-Break">API enabled</span></li>
				<li>A sense of achievement that you have reached this far in your <span class="No-Break">learning process</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Advanced automation tools</h1>
			<p>Throughout this book, I have emphasized the value of automation and how important it is to the DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>realm and the increase of your productivity in general. It is very hard to go overboard with automation as long as you’re careful with it and understand your use case. We have expanded our toolbelts throughout this book to allow us to automate tasks in a number of scenarios. We even figured out how to automate those automations. But now, let’s look into a tool that may take this process a step further. It also happens to be a personal favorite <span class="No-Break">of mine.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">AWS Step Functions</strong> is something that I am always excited to talk about and use. Whenever I look <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>for the gold standard of automation workflow tools, it is this that I think of. Any other automation tool that I have seen that works well has had very similar functionality and usability to Step Functions. There are, of course, equivalent services in the other major clouds that can be used as a replacement and that work well in those environments, but the UX on Step Functions is the one that I prefer and is the one that will be the easiest to explain in <span class="No-Break">this workflow.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s go <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>into a few steps (and steps inside of steps) in <span class="No-Break">Step Functions:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Log in to your AWS account, and on the console, search for <span class="No-Break"><strong class="sour e-inline">Step Functions</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Go to the <strong class="bold">Step Functions</strong> page, and at the top right, click on <strong class="bold">Create </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">state machine</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p class="list-inset">The Step Functions workflow consists of actions, which are the invocation of services, completely based on the parameters that their APIs take, and flows, which direct the flow of <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
			<p class="list-inset">The example function that we will demonstrate consists entirely of flows since using actions simply requires calling APIs, and you can apply them wherever you see fit. Here is a diagram of <span class="No-Break">this flow:</span></p>

				<li class="upper-roman">Once this is done, both numbers are compared to see which one is greater than <span class="No-Break">the other.</span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman">If <strong class="bold">Ping</strong> is greater than <strong class="bold">Pong</strong>, the state machine stops its execution; otherwise, it executes the parallel <span class="No-Break">state instead.</span></li>

			<p>This particular <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>application seems rather mundane, but it is a great proof of concept for how Step Functions can be used to make workflows. An example of a real-world application for this could be a simple one that we have used before: deleting all the objects in an S3 bucket. There is no clear way in the user interface of AWS to delete all your objects at once; you need to do it one by one. But with Step Functions (which is integrated with every AWS service), you can list out and delete all the objects in an S3 bucket in parallel if you want to. Now, we will pivot to the monitoring of such applications to learn some insights into how to make them <span class="No-Break">even better.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Advanced monitoring tools</h1>
			<p>The purpose <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>behind monitoring has always been to make sure that the things you said were working are still working. And it is often the case that they won’t be. It could be your fault or not; the concept of fault gets in the way of solving the problem. The proper monitoring of your workloads provides the path to more easily solving <span class="No-Break">your problems.</span></p>
			<p>The simplest workloads can be monitored and the reactions to the information received can be automated so that you don’t even have to be involved most of the time when it comes to dealing with something going wrong. In more complex workloads, it is still important to keep up monitoring for faster reaction times to any situation, as well as to get more information on the situation in <span class="No-Break">real time.</span></p>
			<p>Often, your solution, as it gets more complex, starts using more tools. More tools and services means the requirement for more monitoring and also more complex monitoring. If your monitoring comes from multiple places at the same time, it can become quite <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>a hassle to deal with. So, a good solution in this case would be to centralize the monitoring in a central location that can hold and manage all of <span class="No-Break">that data.</span></p>
			<p>This is where <strong class="bold">Grafana</strong> comes in, and it is the tool I want to talk about because it provides not <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>only a ridiculously wide range of monitoring options but also an incredible range of deployment options with which you can make your Grafana instance managed or customized, meaning that it is a solution for both kinds of people: those who prefer self-made solutions and those who <span class="No-Break">prefer ready-made.</span></p>
			<p>When I first started looking into Grafana, I was writing a blog on how to monitor multiple compute instances over several different clouds using the monitoring services of one cloud, and I found that while that is pretty simple, there are still a few awkward hitches to the solution. Most of the time, choosing one cloud over the other resulted in complications arising in other services on the platform. A lot of these problems were solved by Grafana and all the love and work that has gone into <span class="No-Break">making it.</span></p>
			<p>So, let’s dive into the use of Grafana with its free <span class="No-Break">account tier:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Firstly, create a Grafana account. It is completely free and has a lot of SSO options, which <span class="No-Break">I appreciate.</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.7 – Grafana signup</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">It will then <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>ask you for your own personal monitoring subdomain URL and the region for deploying your instance. Once you set those, you are good <span class="No-Break">to go.</span></li>
				<li>Alternatively, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>download and install Grafana on a custom server from here: <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/download?edition=oss">https://grafana.com/grafana/download?edition=oss</a>. It has installation instructions for practically every OS that you can <span class="No-Break">think of.</span></li>
				<li>Let’s take a look at <span class="No-Break">our dashboard:</span></li>

			<p class="list-inset">As you can see, Grafana offers us a lot of monitoring options, integrations, and data sources. For this exercise, we will use a data source that is very ubiquitous that just about anyone can access: <span class="No-Break">Google Sheets.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">In your <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>console’s search tab, search for <strong class="sour e-inline">Google Sheets</strong>. You will then have to install the plugin. It is the blue button at the <span class="No-Break">far right:</span></li>

				<li class="upper-roman">Follow the steps given to create a service account and give that service account’s email address access to your sample <span class="No-Break">Google Sheet.</span></li>

			<p class="list-inset">Again, this changes according to changes <span class="No-Break">in data.</span></p>
			<p>So far, we <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>have seen events and automations that deal with events. But what happens when an event occurs that you can’t just reset your way out of? What happens when you are on the back foot and are forced to run damage control? Well, we are going to find out in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Advanced event response strategies</h1>
			<p>An event response should be simple and organized, and it should bring about the solution to whatever caused the event in the first place. But, once again, no matter how hard we try, it is never that simple. Sometimes you’re working with a system you haven’t had <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>the chance to work with much. Sometimes the team that you work with is not experienced enough to help out in any meaningful way. These circumstances cannot be helped because of time and personnel constraints, and they are largely out of our control. In such situations, we simply have to make do with what <span class="No-Break">we have.</span></p>
			<p>But there is one scenario that happens very often and causes widespread damage to the point where the response to the event stops being about damage recovery and starts being about what you can recover from the damage already done. This will occur if any sort of incident goes unreported or unmonitored for a long period of time. These situations often occur when there is some sort of data breach, or an unknown/undiscovered error is present in <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></p>
			<p>So, what do you do when you suffer such a scenario? Well, the first thing to do is not to panic. But don’t think <em class="itali">don’t panic</em> – that’ll make you panic more! Approach the situation logically. I will now give you insight into how I would approach such a situation. It is based <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>on situations that I have faced in the past, as well as everything I have learned about problem-solving from all sorts of places. I think it’s a good way to solve a lot of problems, IT or otherwise. So let’s get <span class="No-Break">into it.</span></p>
			<p><em class="itali">Step </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="itali">0: Read</em></span></p>
			<p><em class="itali">Because: You don’t do </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="itali">that enough</em></span></p>
			<p>Seriously, a lot of errors can be solved just by reading the outputs of those errors or glitches. Trust the thing you see and you will be rewarded; the solutions to your problems lie right in front of you. Well, the first steps to the solutions, anyway. But if you want to get there, you need to read and understand the process of getting there. You cannot get to step 1 without knowing all of the details in front <span class="No-Break">of you.</span></p>
			<p><em class="itali">Step 1: If it is a single problem, </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="itali">google it</em></span></p>
			<p><em class="itali">Because: You are </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="itali">not alone.</em></span></p>
			<p>This is serious advice. 90% of any sort of error that you encounter can be solved by Googling the error. This is because someone else has probably encountered your problem before. They have probably had the correct solution given to them before too. Chances are really high that you will find the solution to your problem on a <em class="itali">Stack Overflow</em> forum, a GitHub repository comment, an obscure YouTube video, or somewhere like that. You might be thinking to yourself: “It’s not that easy – no way can I solve my biggest problems just by googling them.” Stop thinking that right now! I once saw someone spend a full two hours trying a migration bridge, which we managed in about five minutes after looking at a YouTube tutorial. It happens – stop wasting your time and look for quick, informed results. They’ll handle the minor problems, and believe me, most problems <span class="No-Break">are minor.</span></p>
			<p><em class="itali">Step 2: If it is several problems, google it several times (or, now, </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="itali">ChatGPT it)</em></span></p>
			<p><em class="itali">Because: One big problem is several small problems combined </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="itali">into one</em></span></p>
			<p>It’s true: any problem can be broken down into its smallest components and solved at that level. It is basic logic; if you have a big problem, turn it into smaller problems and google those. If it is a really big problem or breaking down the problem will be mundane and take a <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>lot of your time, you can use ChatGPT for that now; it is fairly good at that. Digesting a large amount of useless text into smaller, useful versions is probably what ChatGPT is best at. Use it. Use these great tools that you have at <span class="No-Break">your disposal.</span></p>
			<p><em class="itali">Step 3: Follow the methods of induction </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="itali">and deduction</em></span></p>
			<p><em class="itali">Because: It will solve any everyday problem </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="itali">you have</em></span></p>
			<p>Solutions and solving problems are very different from having ideas. Ideas are like lightning bolts from God; they are ghosts in our system, appearing out of the oddest of places. Grabbing an idea and bringing it to fruition is an ethereal experience, like having a religious revelation. Solutions are not that. They are simple, fundamental, and – if you know how to solve a problem – much easier to approach. The logic can be summarized in two words: induction <span class="No-Break">and deduction.</span></p>
			<p>Every major problem that I have ever solved where I had access to a sample environment, I have solved with this logic. It’s something I found in <em class="itali">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>, where the narrator solves the most mundane problems through these two methods and connects these concepts to those of quantum physics and Zen Buddhism. These are not complex concepts, but all problem-solving can be defined within <span class="No-Break">their parameters.</span></p>
			<p>Induction is recreating the elements that cause the problem in a system to know exactly where the problem has occurred. This is useful in incident management when an incident needs to be recreated in a sample application and then breaking down those steps to find out where it all <span class="No-Break">went wrong.</span></p>
			<p>Deduction is <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>starting at the end and going back to the beginning. This is used when the logic of the error is not recreatable or an incident has occurred already with no idea of how it occurred. In this case, you work back from the end result and figure out what could possibly have caused <span class="No-Break">these results.</span></p>
			<p>So, summarizing these results in a diagram, you can look at them <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer168" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_13_16.jpg" alt="Figure 13.16 – The steps to solving any IT problem you want"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.16 – The steps to solving any IT problem you want</p>
			<p>And that is how you solve all of your problems. Try it out on a few of them and see how far you get. If you want to know about the formation of ideas, well, they are quite random, but they can be specified and turned into action points based on methods similar to these. So, now you have learned everything. Use your <span class="No-Break">knowledge wisely.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Alright, this is the end, not just of the chapter but of the book. The end of your journey as a reader of this book and of mine as a first-time author. It has been q<a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>uite the journey. Talking about this chapter in general, it was a lot more abstract and a lot less code-focused than a lot of the other chapters, but that is because I’ve come to understand one thing when it comes to all of these systems: everything is code. Everything you touch will have been coded in some way; it is just up to you to understand and manipulate the logic <span class="No-Break">behind it.</span></p>
			<p>In the section regarding Step Functions, you learned about a very useful automation tool, but you also learned that it is a way to use coding logic visually while integrating that way into a lot of powerful tools <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<p>In the section on advanced monitoring, we learned about a powerful monitoring and visualization tool in Grafana and the importance of centralized monitoring in preserving your sanity by not having to look through data from multiple locations and then parsing through them, and instead having one location that will work for all <span class="No-Break">your workloads.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, you learned about how I approach problem-solving, an effective method if I do say so myself. I hope you get the chance to use it on your own workloads. This is a sort of meta code, an algorithm that is not beholden to any platform or technology but will work effectively on all <span class="No-Break">of them.</span></p>
			<p>And so, I must bid you adieu. We have come to the end, but look at it only as the end of the beginning, because what happens after is the most important part. This is what will define the person you are and the things that you will do. Now comes the part where you apply all of this knowledge in your own daily dealings. <em class="itali">Remember: the power is with you; it is time to </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="itali">use it</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
