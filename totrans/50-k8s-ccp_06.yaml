    a whole. In fact, that’s probably why the **Certified Kubernetes Administrator**
    (**CKA**) program is so popular and a prerequisite to the **Certified Kubernetes
    Security** (**CKS**) exam. Although certifications aren’t the be-all-and-end-all,
    and you definitely don’t need them to work with Kubernetes, it gives you an idea
    of what a critical component is, which is the infrastructure and overall cluster
    management.

    is the containerized application deployment piece. The second set of the 50 concepts
    will go into overall deployments, which you’ll learn about in these sections.

- en: Typically, when an engineer first gets started with Kubernetes, they’ll deploy
    a simple web app such as nginx or Hello World. They’ll grab the container image,
    put it in a Kubernetes manifest, run `kubectl apply –f`, and call it a day. The
    point is that popping a container image in a manifest and running a command is
    the easy part. The hard part is thinking about the actual strategy that you’re
    utilizing. Will you implement GitOps? CI/CD? A service mesh? How are you managing
    automation and repeatability? How many apps need to be deployed? There’s a lot
    that goes into the thought process from a strategy and architecture standpoint.

    deploy containerized apps. Although we couldn’t go into every specific use case,
    you should be able to take what’s in these two chapters and have a good path forward
    for what to use in your production environment.
