- en: Unless you have been living under a rock, you might have noticed that the vast
    majority of new system deployments have moved out of corporate data centers and
    into cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud.
    The process of moving existing in-house applications is well underway, from the
    finance industry to telecommunication providers. DevOps engineers need to be well
    versed in building managed distributed platforms that enable their companies to
    operate in cloud, multi-cloud, and hybrid-cloud environments.

    images using Packer on the AWS platform, use Go with Terraform to create your
    own custom Terraform provider, program the Kubernetes API to extend its capabilities
    for your needs, provision resources using Azure's cloud SDK, and design resilient
    DevOps software that can avoid the mistakes that large cloud providers have already
    made.
