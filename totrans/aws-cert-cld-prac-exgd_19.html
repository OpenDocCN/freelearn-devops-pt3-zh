			<p>Many companies looking to move to the cloud have heard of the cost benefits associated with shifting from a CAPEX model of investment in IT to an OPEX model. CAPEX refers <a id="_idIndexMarker1552"/>to capital expenditure for the procurement of long-term assets such as infrastructure equipment, vehicles, and buildings. A company that purchases such assets will own those assets, but this tends to tie up capital that could otherwise have been spent on other resources that directly benefit the business. Consider a company having access to spare capital to invest in research and development of their products and services, as opposed to simply purchasing IT infrastructure equipment. </p>
			<p>OPEX refers to<a id="_idIndexMarker1553"/> operating expenditure and is an ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system. In the context of cloud computing, OPEX is the ongoing cost of leasing resources from the cloud provider, such as running a fleet of web servers, where the business is charged on a pay-as-you-go model. The idea that you do not need to tie up vast amounts of capital in expensive hardware equipment (which depreciates rapidly), or expensive software licenses for your on-premises infrastructure, is a critical factor for your company's financies. </p>
			<p>However, simply shifting to the cloud is not necessarily going to save you money. The solutions you design to host your applications in the cloud need to be cost-optimized and architected to ensure you get the best value for your dollar. The good news is that with a cloud provider such as AWS, the solutions you design can be highly cost-effective. For one thing, you can ensure that you only pay for services when you consume them. In addition, each service offering has various options to minimize costs that you can configure, based on your access patterns and core business requirements.</p>
			<p>One thing to be careful about is that you should not consider cost optimization in isolation. Minimizing cost is important for the business, but so is ensuring application availability, reliability, and scalability. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we look at the fundamentals of cost optimization and the key components of AWS billing and pricing. We discuss key principles and look at various tools to help you gain insight and manage your costs effectively.</p>

			<p>To complete the exercises in this chapter, you will need to log in to your AWS account as the IAM user <strong class="bold">Alice</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-372"><a id="_idTextAnchor377"/>An overview of billing and pricing on AWS</h1>
			<p>AWS charges you based on three core components, which are the amount of <em class="italic">computing</em>, <em class="italic">storage</em>, and <em class="italic">outbound data transfers</em> you perform. There are some deviations to this, but these are the primary cost drivers. With compute, this could represent the<a id="_idIndexMarker1554"/> number of hours that your <strong class="bold">On-Demand Instance</strong> is in the running state or the number of <a id="_idIndexMarker1555"/>Lambda executions you perform. With <a id="_idIndexMarker1556"/>storage, you are charged per GB. In both cases, you are charged for any data transferred out of the Region or AWS. The data transfer out rate is dependent on the service and the Region from which the data originates.</p>
			<p>A couple of key points to note here are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For data transfer within a Region:<ul><li>If an <strong class="bold">internet gateway</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker1557"/>used to send data to an AWS public service (Amazon S3, DynamoDB, and so on) in the same Region, then there are no data transfer charges.</li><li>If a <strong class="bold">NAT gateway</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker1558"/>used to access those public services in the same Region, then there is a data processing charge, calculated at a per-GB rate.</li><li>Data transfers between workloads within the <a id="_idIndexMarker1559"/>same <strong class="bold">Availability Zone</strong> are free. For certain services, such as EC2, data transfers across Availability Zones will incur a data transfer charge. </li></ul></li>
				<li>For data transfers across Regions, there is always a data transfer charge.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You are not charged for data transferred into AWS, for example, from your on-premises data center. </p>
			<p>Let's examine some key principles of pricing on AWS and the strategies you should adopt when moving your workloads to the cloud.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-373"><a id="_idTextAnchor378"/>Understanding AWS cost optimization</h1>
			<p>Depending on <a id="_idIndexMarker1560"/>your workloads and specific business requirements, you have access to a wide range of service options and tools to help you optimize for costs, ensuring that you monitor and control your spending. Choosing the right combination of services and deploying the correct resource configurations will help you run a tight ship. Here are some key concepts to bear in mind when architecting solutions for the cloud:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Choose the right pricing model</strong>: You <a id="_idIndexMarker1561"/>can use On-Demand Instances when you know that you only need the compute resources for a limited amount of time and for a specific short-term project. From a reliability point of view, you need to ensure that there are no interruptions to the service, but you are not going to be using the resources 24/7, 365 days a year. In this case, an on-demand pricing model works well. Alternatively, you can invest<a id="_idIndexMarker1562"/> in <strong class="bold">reserved capacity</strong>, which can save up to 72% over equivalent on-demand capacity price, but only if you need the resources 24/7, and for a much longer duration, for example, a year. You can also consider <a id="_idIndexMarker1563"/>using <strong class="bold">Spot EC2 instances</strong> for applications that are fault-tolerant, scalable, or flexible, and where your application can tolerate interruptions. Spot instances can save you up to a 90% discount off on-demand prices and there is no upfront commitment. Finally, consider opting <a id="_idIndexMarker1564"/>for the <strong class="bold">compute Savings Plans</strong> to reduce EC2, Fargate, and Lambda costs. EC2 Savings Plans can deliver savings of up to 72% on your AWS compute usage. Here, you make a commitment to a certain amount of compute usage, and you are automatically charged at the discounted savings plan prices.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Match capacity with demand</strong>: AWS offers <a id="_idIndexMarker1565"/>several tools to help you identify usage patterns. AWS Cost Explorer resource optimization (discussed later in this chapter) can help you identify instances that are idle or have low utilization. You can save money by either reducing the capacity provisioned or if possible, stopping the instances during periods when they are not in use. You can use <strong class="bold">AWS Instance Scheduler</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1566"/> is a CloudFormation template offered by AWS that can help reduce costs by configuring start and stop schedules for your Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS instances. This is like the exercise you completed in <a href="B17124_12_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Automation and Deployment on AWS</em>, where you configured Amazon CloudWatch Events and Lambda to automatically start and stop EC2 instances at scheduled times. Another service that can be stopped when not in use is Amazon RDS. In the case of Amazon Redshift, you can pause the service.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implement processes to identify resource waste</strong>: Carefully monitoring your AWS resources <a id="_idIndexMarker1567"/>will help you identify ones that are sitting idle and not being used. For example, if you have EBS volumes where utilization is less than 1 IOPS per day for a period of 7 days, then it is likely that volume is not being used. You can save on costs by taking a snapshot of those volumes and deleting them. For Amazon S3, you can use the <strong class="bold">Amazon S3 analytics</strong> service <a id="_idIndexMarker1568"/>to understand storage access patterns that will help you decide when to transition less frequently used objects to infrequent storage classes. You can also use the results from the tool to help build your Amazon S3 life cycle rules. Another area where you can save costs is on the networking front. Amazon elastic load balancers are chargeable and if you happen to have any idle ELBs, then it makes sense to terminate them. You can analyze metrics from your ELBs and watch out for ones that have a <strong class="source-inline">RequestCount</strong> value of less than 100 over the past 7 days, which could be ideal candidates to terminate.<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p><p class="callout">Amazon S3 analytics will not provide recommendations for transitions to the One Zone-IA or S3 Glacier storage classes.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, we examined some core concepts to ensure that the workloads you deploy in the cloud are cost-optimized. In the next section, we will look at various tools and services that will help you monitor, control, and manage your costs effectively.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-374"><a id="_idTextAnchor379"/>Learning about AWS billing and cost management tools</h1>
			<p>In this section, we'll <a id="_idIndexMarker1569"/>look at several AWS billing and cost management tools, enabling you to visualize your usage and spend across your AWS accounts as well as implementing better cost control strategies. We'll start by looking at the Cost Explorer service.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-375"><a id="_idTextAnchor380"/>AWS Cost Explorer</h2>
			<p>AWS Cost Explorer <a id="_idIndexMarker1570"/>enables you <a id="_idIndexMarker1571"/>to monitor and visualize your costs via dashboards and reports. You can access 12 months of usage and spending data as well as forecasting what your future costs will be for the next 12 months. You need to enable the Cost Explorer service and, once enabled, the current month's reporting data is accessible after 24 hours. Additional data from previous months will start to appear after a few more days.</p>
			<p>The AWS Cost Explorer home page displays a snapshot of your spending. Here, you will find <strong class="bold">Current month costs</strong> as well as <strong class="bold">Forecasted month end costs</strong>, as per the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer293" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_15_01.jpg" alt="Figure 15.1 â€“ Cost Explorer home page&#13;&#10;" width="996" height="169"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.1 â€“ Cost Explorer home page</p>
			<p>AWS Cost Explorer <a id="_idIndexMarker1572"/>offers several types of reports. For example, in the following screenshot, you will see a <em class="italic">monthly cost by service</em> report for one of my AWS accounts:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer294" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_15_02.jpg" alt="Figure 15.2 â€“ Cost Explorer â€“ monthly cost by service report&#13;&#10;" width="1053" height="516"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.2 â€“ Cost Explorer â€“ monthly cost by service report</p>
			<p>The report <a id="_idIndexMarker1573"/>shows the last 6 months of spending broken down by service, comprising EC2 instances, Amazon RDS, and storage archives in Amazon Glacier. </p>
			<p>Additional features of Cost Explorer include granularly filtering your data to understand daily and hourly cost patterns and by resource types. </p>
			<p>AWS Cost Explorer also provides various recommendations where you can save some money. For example, from the left-hand menu of the AWS Cost Explorer console, you can select <strong class="bold">Recommendations</strong>, under the <strong class="bold">Reservations</strong> category, to see where Cost Explorer <a id="_idIndexMarker1574"/>suggests purchasing EC2 <strong class="bold">Reserved Instances</strong> (<strong class="bold">RI</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker1575"/>your existing on-demand workloads as per the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer295" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_15_03.jpg" alt="Figure 15.3 â€“ Cost Explorer RI recommendations&#13;&#10;" width="1105" height="245"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.3 â€“ Cost Explorer RI recommendations</p>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker1576"/>can see, purchasing RI for the two on-demand instances I have running would potentially save me 33% off my final costs. </p>
			<p>AWS Cost Explorer can also be used to send you EC2 <em class="italic">rightsizing recommendations</em> to help you examine your historical usage patterns and identify resources that are being underutilized. AWS Cost Explorer will be able to identify idle instances and allow you to take action to terminate or resize your underutilized resources.</p>
			<p>Another report you can view within Cost Explorer<a id="_idIndexMarker1577"/> is the <strong class="bold">RI utilization report</strong>. The RI utilization report enables you to identify the savings made from using RI over on-demand options for Amazon EC2, Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, and so on. The RI report also provides details of how much you may have overspent because you are underutilizing your RI.</p>
			<p>Finally, AWS Cost Explorer comes with a security feature to help you detect anomalies in your spending patterns, and the root causes, and can be configured to send you alerts using Amazon SNS. </p>
			<p>In this section, you have learned about the AWS Cost Explorer tool, which enables you to visualize and manage your costs and allows you to create custom reports to identify usage patterns and trends. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we discuss how cost allocation tags can help you identify which services and resources you are consuming and spending on.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-376"><a id="_idTextAnchor381"/>Cost allocation tags </h2>
			<p>Previously we <a id="_idIndexMarker1578"/>have discussed how <a id="_idIndexMarker1579"/>important tagging your resources is. It allows you to not only identify your resources, but you can also automate and run management tasks against your resources using these tags as a form of identification. Additionally, you can also use tagging to help you identify which resources are costing you money and by using cost allocation tags, you can track usage by different projects, departments, business units, and so on.</p>
			<p>Tags consist of a <em class="italic">key</em> and a <em class="italic">value</em>, and for every resource, you can have up to 50 key-value tags. In addition, the tag key must be unique, and each key can only have one value. You need to first activate cost allocation tags, which AWS will then use to help you analyze your costs using those tags. There are two types of cost allocation tags:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">AWS-generated tags</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker1580"/> are created and defined by AWS and the AWS Marketplace.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User-defined tags</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker1581"/>can be created and defined by you based on your business cost management and naming conventions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Activating the tags can be done from the billing management console and each <em class="italic">tag key</em> will need to be activated individually. Once activated, AWS will generate <strong class="bold">comma-separated values</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSV</strong>) file reports <a id="_idIndexMarker1582"/>with your usage and costs grouped by your active tags.</p>
			<p>Next, let's look at the cost and usage report.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-377"><a id="_idTextAnchor382"/>Cost and usage report</h2>
			<p>AWS offers <a id="_idIndexMarker1583"/>a cost and usage report tool that provides a very detailed breakdown of the resources you use and the <a id="_idIndexMarker1584"/>associated costs. The report includes usage amounts and units consumed, rates, costs, and product attributes. Reports are published to an Amazon S3 bucket of your choice, and the reports can be configured to provide a breakdown of your costs by hour, day, or month. These reports are made available in your S3 bucket in CSV format, which you can then import into Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet tools.</p>
			<p>In addition, you<a id="_idIndexMarker1585"/> can also integrate the reports for use with Amazon Athena, Redshift, and QuickSight, as well as setting the compression type to GZIP, ZIP, or Parquet.</p>
			<p>Next, let's examine the AWS Budgets service.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-378"><a id="_idTextAnchor383"/>AWS Budgets</h2>
			<p>AWS Budgets <a id="_idIndexMarker1586"/>enables you to understand <a id="_idIndexMarker1587"/>how money is being spent on the workloads you deploy in the cloud. You can use AWS Budgets to track your cost and usage across different types of projects you may be running in your organization. You may have different departments requiring different cloud services and, based on their requirements, specify monthly budgets for their spending. </p>
			<p>If your budgets exceed the threshold (whether actual or forecasted), you can define specific actions to <a id="_idIndexMarker1588"/>take on your AWS account. At present, you can define three types of actions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An <strong class="bold">Identity and Access Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) policy</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service Control Policies</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCPs</strong>)</li>
				<li>Target <a id="_idIndexMarker1589"/>running instances (EC2 or RDS)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For example, you could specify an IAM policy that denies the ability to launch new EC2 instances if the monthly budget for EC2 has been exceeded. You can then apply this policy to the IAM user, group, or role used to launch instances. </p>
			<p>AWS Budgets actions can be executed automatically when the threshold has been exceeded or can be configured for manual approval if required.</p>
			<p>With AWS Budgets, you can also set up alerts using Amazon SNS to be notified (or perform some event-driven action) if the actual or forecast spending is likely to cross the budgeted threshold values. You can also configure variable target amounts, so that the budgeted amount increases by a certain percentage over a period because consumption is likely to increase.</p>
			<p>AWS Budgets can also be used to ensure that you stay within specified quotas and limits, including staying under a specific AWS Free Tier offering.</p>
			<p>There are several types of budgets you can create, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost budgets</strong>: Define <a id="_idIndexMarker1590"/>specific amounts you are willing to spend.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Usage budgets</strong>: Define <a id="_idIndexMarker1591"/>how much you want to use a specific service.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">RI utilization budgets</strong>: Specify <a id="_idIndexMarker1592"/>a utilization threshold and be alerted if you use less than the threshold value. This enables you to identify those RI resources that may be underutilized and reconsider whether those reservations are required.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">RI coverage budgets</strong>: Identify <a id="_idIndexMarker1593"/>how much of your instance usage is covered by the reservation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Saving plan utilization budgets</strong>: Identify <a id="_idIndexMarker1594"/>when your usage of savings plans falls below utilization threshold values, enabling you to identify under-utilized savings plans.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Saving plan coverage budgets</strong>: Identify<a id="_idIndexMarker1595"/> how much of your instance usage is covered by saving plans.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1596"/>looked at AWS Budgets, which can be used to ensure you do not overspend on the resources you deploy on AWS. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we move on to look at some AWS pricing and cost calculators.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-379"><a id="_idTextAnchor384"/>Learning how to use the AWS pricing and TCO calculators</h1>
			<p>AWS offers <a id="_idIndexMarker1597"/>calculators to help you estimate costs associated with setting up and deploying resources on AWS. Two key calculators are the <strong class="bold">AWS Pricing Calculator</strong> and <strong class="bold">Migration Evaluator</strong> (previously known as the TCO Calculator).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-380"><a id="_idTextAnchor385"/>The AWS Pricing Calculator</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker1598"/>AWS Pricing Calculator is a tool used to calculate the estimated monthly costs of deploying and configuring AWS services and resources. You can use the AWS Pricing Calculator to work out estimated monthly charges for your projects and applications that you wish to deploy on AWS. You can view prices per service or per group of services to analyze your proposed architecture costs.</p>
			<p>You can then send the estimate's unique link to other team members, finance, and your clients to help analyze the potential cost of the project. </p>
			<p>To see how the AWS Pricing Calculator works, let's take an example of a simple application solution comprising elastic load balancers, EC2 instances, and Amazon RDS databases. Refer to the following architectural diagram for the proposed design:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer296" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_15_04.jpg" alt="Figure 15.4 â€“ AWS Pricing Calculator example â€“ application architecture &#13;&#10;" width="905" height="661"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.4 â€“ AWS Pricing Calculator example â€“ application architecture </p>
			<p>In the preceding architecture, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1599"/>core resources deployed are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A VPC in the <strong class="bold">US-East-1</strong> Region, with<a id="_idIndexMarker1600"/> six subnets, spread across two Availability Zones.</li>
				<li>An internet gateway to allow traffic into and out of the VPC.</li>
				<li>An <strong class="bold">Application Load Balancer</strong> (<strong class="bold">ALB</strong>) to allow users on the internet to access<a id="_idIndexMarker1601"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker1602"/>web application running on the <strong class="bold">app s</strong><strong class="bold">ervers</strong>.</li>
				<li>Two EC2 instances, one in each Availability Zone, within private subnets. An <strong class="bold">Auto Scaling group</strong> designed<a id="_idIndexMarker1603"/> to scale out/in as required. For this example, we will keep the instance fleet size to two EC2 instances, replacing any failed EC2 instances if required.</li>
				<li>An Amazon RDS database running the MySQL engine, configured <a id="_idIndexMarker1604"/>with <strong class="bold">Multi-AZ</strong> to offer high availability and resilience.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Determining <a id="_idIndexMarker1605"/>the estimated costs for provisioning these resources also requires you to be aware of the type and amount of traffic that will be transferred in and out. These details are going to be derived from setting a test environment and monitoring your workloads or perhaps from previous deployments.</p>
			<p>To simplify this example, let's assume that your architecture is provisioned as per the following table:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer297" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Table_15.1.jpg" alt="Table 15.1 â€“ AWS Pricing Calculator example architecture&#13;&#10;" width="1650" height="882"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Table 15.1 â€“ AWS Pricing Calculator example architecture</p>
			<p>To determine the estimated monthly costs for the set of resources as detailed in the preceding table, you can use the <a id="_idIndexMarker1606"/>AWS Pricing Calculator available at <a href="https://calculator.aws/">https://calculator.aws/</a>.</p>
			<p>Within the AWS Pricing Calculator, you will need to select the various services and provide resource<a id="_idIndexMarker1607"/> configuration information as per the example shown in the screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer298" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_15_05.jpg" alt="Figure 15.5 â€“ AWS Pricing Calculator â€“ EC2 instance specifications&#13;&#10;" width="1106" height="768"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.5 â€“ AWS Pricing Calculator â€“ EC2 instance specifications</p>
			<p>Once you have provided all the various configuration items as well as an indicative quantity of data<a id="_idIndexMarker1608"/> transferred in and out, you will be provided with an estimate table, like the following:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer299" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Table_15.2_a.jpg" alt="Table 15.2 â€“ AWS Pricing Calculator â€“ estimated costs&#13;&#10;" width="1650" height="320"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer300" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Table_15.2_b.jpg" alt="Table 15.2 â€“ AWS Pricing Calculator â€“ estimated costs&#13;&#10;" width="1650" height="766"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Table 15.2 â€“ AWS Pricing Calculator â€“ estimated costs</p>
			<p>Note that the<a id="_idIndexMarker1609"/> aforementioned costs are just estimates and to keep the example simple, don't cover minute configuration details for your resources. For example, no backup storage is included with Amazon RDS and no routing policies are defined for Route 53. In addition, the prices exclude taxes.</p>
			<p>Next, let's look at a brief overview of Migration Evaluator.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-381"><a id="_idTextAnchor386"/>AWS Migration Evaluator</h2>
			<p>Many <a id="_idIndexMarker1610"/>companies looking to move to the cloud will need to understand the cost implication of migration projects required to complete the shift from their on-premises environments. As well as designing the technical steps required to perform the migration, companies need to perform estimated cost analysis and the potential savings likely to be gained by moving to the cloud. </p>
			<p>AWS Migration Evaluator removes the guesswork in planning any migration project to AWS. Your organization can work with the Migration Evaluator team to help capture millions of real-time data points related to your IT environment and review recommendations for the right sizing and right costing of workloads on AWS. With the Migration Evaluator service, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker1611"/>use <strong class="bold">AWS Application Discovery Service</strong>, the <strong class="bold">TSO Logic agentless collector</strong>, or third-party tools to discover and gain insights into your current compute, storage, and total<a id="_idIndexMarker1612"/> cost of ownership. The agentless collector tool can analyze your on-premises resources requiring just read-only access to your VMware, Hyper-V, Windows, Linux, Active Directory, and SQL Server infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Migration Evaluator then provides extensive analysis and matches your existing workloads with appropriate AWS resources, such as the correct EC2 instance types, storage platform and database services, and so on, that can be provisioned in the cloud for your applications' workloads. The service can also help perform <em class="italic">what-if</em> analysis such as identifying cost savings by selecting different purchase options for your EC2 instances as well as incorporating elasticity features to eliminate waste by provisioning resources only when there is demand.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, Migration Evaluator helps companies build business case reports and illustrate the cost benefits of moving to the cloud.</p>
			<p>In this section, we looked at two types of AWS calculators to help identify costs associated with hosting workloads and applications in the cloud as well as performing total cost of ownership analysis with a view to helping customers make the right migration decisions.</p>
			<p>In the upcoming exercise for this chapter, we look at how to work with AWS Budgets.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-382"><a id="_idTextAnchor387"/>Exercise 15.1 â€“ setting up cost budgets on AWS</h1>
			<p>In this exercise, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1613"/>will create a total monthly cost budget for your <a id="_idIndexMarker1614"/>workloads. This will allow you to monitor your spending and avoid unintentional cost overruns:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Log in to the AWS Management Console using the credentials of the IAM user <em class="italic">Alice</em>.</li>
				<li>Search for <strong class="source-inline">AWS Budgets</strong> from the top search bar on the console screen, and navigate to the AWS Budgets console page.</li>
				<li>From the right-hand pane, click on the <strong class="bold">Create a budget</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Next, from the list of <strong class="bold">Budget types</strong>, select <strong class="bold">Cost budget â€“ Recommended</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button in the bottom-right corner of the page.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Set budget amount</strong> pane, configure the following:<ol><li>Set the period to <strong class="bold">Monthly</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong class="bold">Recurring budget</strong>.</li><li>Set the start month of your choice.</li><li>Select the <strong class="bold">Fixed</strong> option under <strong class="bold">Choose how to budget</strong>.</li><li>Next, enter your budget amount.

			<p>Note that you can set up five additional alerts for your budgets, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When current monthly costs exceed the budgeted amount</li>
				<li>When current monthly costs exceed 80% of the budgeted amount</li>
				<li>When forecasted monthly costs exceed the budgeted amount</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section exercise, you learned how to create monthly cost budgets for your AWS account. Setting custom budgets can alert you if you are crossing specific threshold values or even forecasted costs in the future. </p>
			<p>Next, we provide a summary of this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-383"><a id="_idTextAnchor388"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Businesses across the globe of all sizes can benefit from moving their applications and workloads to the cloud and gain a competitive advantage from the vast array of services on offer by AWS. AWS enables customers to build highly available, fault-tolerant, scalable, and resilient cloud solutions. AWS offers some of the latest and greatest cutting-edge technologies to help you design and build robust application solutions. Without AWS, the cost of provisioning the vast pool of services and resources alone would make it impossible for many companies, including start-ups, to innovate. </p>
			<p>One of the prime drivers of cloud adoption is the fact that companies can save on capital expenses and opt for a variable expense model for all their IT investments. This allows businesses to channel more of the previous capital into improving their products and services. However, careful planning and monitoring are required. It is all too easy to spin the instances and other resources and incur unnecessary costs, especially where you may have overprovisioned the infrastructure required to support your applications. This clearly defeats one of the primary reasons for moving to the cloud.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned about the principles of cost optimization, and the approaches you can take to ensure you consume the right services at the right price. You learned how to provision resources when you need them most and not have idle resources simply sitting around gathering dust. Different pricing options for different workload types enable you to make sensible decisions about your investment. In addition, AWS offers a number of different management and monitoring tools to help you stay well informed about your spending. Using Cost Explorer, cost and usage reports, and AWS Budgets, you can run a tight ship if you implement best practices and plan your solutions carefully. </p>
			<p>Finally, we also reviewed a couple of cost calculators that help you estimate the investment required for implementing solutions on AWS and how migrating your workloads to the cloud could save you money using Migration Evaluator.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we offer two complete exam-style practice questions to help you gauge your understanding of the syllabus for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam and help you prepare for the certification.</p>
			<p>Passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam will help you progress your career in cloud computing. This exam guide has been designed to help you not only achieve exam success, but also gain valuable hands-on experience in architecting, building, and managing real-world cloud solutions. With a vast array of exercises in this study guide, we hope you are now feeling much more confident in tackling real-world business use cases. </p>
			<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your time in going through this material and I hope you have gained valuable knowledge and some hands-on experience in designing cloud solutions. </p>
