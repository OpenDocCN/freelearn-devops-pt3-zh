    Products*, refer to a holistic approach that captures and analyzes the movement
    of work within an organization1\. Value stream networks provide a holistic view
    of an organization by illustrating how people, processes, information, and technology

    delivery across the organization. At their core, they facilitate the progression
    of value from inception to delivery, encompassing interactions, handoffs, and

    anchor it to one or more customer journeys, highlighting its proximity to the
    customer and depicting the focus of its activities to either development or operations.
    Additionally, we can simulate and hypothesize the effects of changes in measurement,

    the customer’s perspective and an invaluable reference for product management
    in recent decades. Customer journeys can be mapped, measured, and used to drive
    customer and outcome-centric conversations. They serve as an excellent reference
    point for technology leaders to engage business leaders on common ground. It’s
    also a far more valuable context than mapping the network with a strictly internal
    or isolated scope.

    provides a common foundation for teams and organizations as they begin to embrace
    the concept of value streams. It offers an outside-in, customer-centric perspective

    outcomes) backward to an idea or request.

    stream. The customer journey, as depicted in *Figure 7**.2*, is mostly beyond
    the organization’s influence. It takes place at the borders of the organization,
    where customers interact with products and services. Its path is primarily determined
    by customers, which may limit the organization’s ability to fully influence or
    optimize it.

    and buys it immediately. The other discovers our company’s products or services
    through advertising, investigates alternatives, gets distracted by other needs,
    and only returns to purchase when timing, needs, and cost align. If these two
    scenarios were viewed through the lens of value streams, they would have dramatically
    different paths and attributes. Lead times for these scenarios would be significantly
    different. Furthermore, there are insufficient mechanisms for measuring work in
    process, value-added time, or percent complete and accurate for customer interactions.
    Customer journeys are typically measured by sentiment, probability of purchase,
    cost of acquisition, conversion rate, order size, and more.'

    operates. While they cannot dictate customer actions, they can implement standardization
    and automation to facilitate improved flow. Key metrics such as lead time, value-added
    time, throughput, quality, and work in process are essential. Organizations can
    guide work through a value stream much more effectively than they can direct a
    customer’s journey.
  prefs: []

    because without it, value streams have no clear direction or focus. They also

    and support the customer journey at critical touchpoints.

    and knowledge, potentially leading to a sale, while the sales and purchase processes—streamlined
    through easy-to-use systems such as checkouts or shopping carts—represent separate
    value streams that culminate in the purchase. This means that when we experience
    an issue with the customer journey, we can trace it directly to the contributing
    value streams. Now, let us discuss how we can visualize the proximity of our value

    the customer’s journey from initial curiosity to product use, product sales, and
