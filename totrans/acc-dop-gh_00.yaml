- en: We are in the 2020s and research has shown us for more than 10 years that companies
    with high developer performance not only outperform their competitors in velocity
    and throughput, they also score higher in quality, innovation, security, employee
    satisfaction, and most importantly, customer satisfaction.

- en: And yet, besides some *unicorn* companies, the majority of traditional businesses
    struggle to transform themselves. Established rigid structures and slow processes,
    monolithic application architectures, and long release cycles for traditional
    products make it hard for companies to change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This, however, is not a new phenomenon. Transformational changes are always
    hard and take many years to succeed, if the companies do succeed at all. The probability
    of failure is also very high. This is because transformation has to happen on
    so many levels – and if these changes are not aligned, the transformation is bound
    to fail. This book will help you with your transformation - not only by providing
    the research for high developer performance but also by providing practical examples
    on how you can accelerate your software delivery.

- en: This book is a practical guide to DevOps. It helps teams that are already on
    their DevOps journey to further advance into DevOps and speed up their software
    delivery performance by providing simple solutions to common problems. It will
    help teams find the right metrics to measure their success and learn from other
    success stories without just copying what these teams have done themselves. The
    book uses GitHub as the DevOps platform and shows how you can leverage the power
    of GitHub for collaboration, lean management, and secure and fast software delivery.

    performance and how they can measure delivery capabilities. They will therefore
    realize where they stand and how they can move forward in their journey with transparency
    and simple solutions for cross-team collaboration. Equipped with simple solutions
    for common problems, they will understand how they can leverage the power of GitHub
    to accelerate: by making work visible with GitHub Projects, measuring right metrics
    with GitHub Insights, using solid and proven engineering practices with GitHub
    Actions and Advanced Security, and moving to an event-based and loosely coupled
    software architecture.'

- en: This book is for developers, solution architects, DevOps engineers, and SREs,
    as well as for engineering or product managers who want to enhance software delivery
    performance. They may be new to DevOps or already have experience but struggle
    to achieve maximum performance. They may already have experience with GitHub Enterprise
    or come from a platform such as Azure DevOps, Team Foundation Server, GitLab,
    Bitbucket, Puppet, Chef, or Jenkins.
