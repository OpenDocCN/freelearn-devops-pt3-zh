			<p class="author-quote">The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">- William Arthur Ward</p>
			<p>In the fast-paced world of business management, one key element often separates successful leaders from the rest: the ability to navigate and optimize the flow of work and deliver value within an organization. For example, imagine your organization is like a well-designed ship with a motivated crew and you have a clear destination—delivering value to your customers. Everything seems perfect, but as we all know, the currents and winds of business are not <span class="No-Break">always predictable.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter will explore how to shift from managing projects to products while leveraging digital enhancements. Sticking with our previous nautical metaphor, we’ll illustrate how navigating your value stream’s path is like sailing through shifting winds <span class="No-Break">and flows.</span></p>
			<p>Value streams constantly change; nothing remains stagnant. However, two shifts remain constant in today’s landscape to become a <span class="No-Break">Lean enterprise:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Shifting from projects to products</strong>: To remain competitive and customer-centric, we must change our focus from managing short-term projects to continuously evolving our business processes, products, and services across their economically viable <span class="No-Break">life cycles</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Harnessing digital enhancements</strong>: Employing digital enhancements is key to effectively improving processes, products, <span class="No-Break">and services</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It’s vital to introduce value stream operating models to build a solid foundation for adaptation, offering a holistic view of value creation and delivery across the organization. These new operating models integrate people, processes, information, and technology to optimize workflow. The shift from project to product and embracing customer-centricity enables sustainable value creation <span class="No-Break">and delivery.</span></p>
			<p>By understanding how optimizing value streams drives organizational transformation, you can improve solutions for customer needs, foster agility, and gain a competitive edge. You will be equipped with strategies for enhanced productivity, efficiency, adaptability, and <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></p>
			<p>The following topics are covered in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shifting from projects <span class="No-Break">to products</span></li>
				<li>Understanding value stream <span class="No-Break">operating models</span></li>
				<li>Identifying and overcoming obstacles to <span class="No-Break">streamlined workflows</span></li>
				<li>Balancing innovation and efficiency in <span class="No-Break">value streams</span></li>
				<li>Optimizing value streams for <span class="No-Break">enhanced performance</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>Shifting from projects to products</h1>
			<p>In the evolution of digital knowledge<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> work, there’s a pivotal shift from project-based to product-centric models, transforming how organizations deliver value and respond to market demands. Mik Kersten’s book <em class="italic">Project to Product </em>drew significant attention to this change, offering a structured framework and practical guidance that solidified the concept.<span class="superscript">1</span> Building upon discussions within the Agile and DevOps communities, Kersten’s work reinforced the importance of product-centric thinking, which Agile methodologies and the DevOps movement had already <span class="No-Break">laid out.</span></p>
			<p>Traditionally, the project-centric<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> paradigm, often associated with the <strong class="bold">Waterfall</strong> <strong class="bold">development</strong> <strong class="bold">model</strong>, emphasized discrete, temporary efforts with a specific scope, budget, and timeline. However, this model proved to be inefficient, unnecessarily delaying projects and allowing coding errors and defects to accumulate, making them increasingly difficult to resolve. Moreover, it often led to siloed efforts focused solely on predetermined deliverables and meeting project milestones rather than on addressing end user needs or fostering <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement.</span></p>
			<p>The modern transition to a product-centric approach represents a fundamental shift in strategy and execution in the digital landscape. Unlike projects, products are seen as living entities that evolve with customer needs and market trends. This shift aligns with Lean, Agile, and DevOps practices, emphasizing long-term value creation, cross-functional collaboration, and a relentless focus on customer experience and <span class="No-Break">feedback loops.</span></p>
			<p>This transition facilitates<a id="_idIndexMarker401"/> a more adaptable and responsive organizational culture, where teams are empowered to iterate and innovate rapidly. The product-centric model fosters a sense of ownership and accountability, as teams are continuously engaged with their product throughout its life cycle, leading to higher quality outcomes and greater alignment with <span class="No-Break">business objectives.</span></p>
			<p>Incorporating the product-oriented approach requires a fundamental shift in mindsets, processes, and management structures within organizations. It aligns more closely with the needs of digital knowledge work, where agility, responsiveness, and continuous improvement are key to sustaining a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving <span class="No-Break">digital marketplace.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.1 </em>contrasts the two models, project versus product, across various dimensions, highlighting the transition from a traditional, delivery-focused approach to a modern, customer-centric one. The product operating model’s emphasis on continuous improvement, adaptability, and customer satisfaction represents<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> a significant shift in how organizations approach digital <span class="No-Break">knowledge work:</span></p>

			<p>In practice, the shift from project to product is rarely a binary switch and can happen at different times in various ways and extents. To better align with product-centric operating models and principles, it’s helpful to consider differences in behavior and operating model across a spectrum as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.2</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.2 – The project to product spectrum</p>
			<p>At one end of the spectrum, behaviors are aligned with traditional project management paradigms; at the other end, behaviors reflect a modern product-centric philosophy. This spectrum is best visualized as a gradient since organizations might find themselves at various points, transitioning<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> from project to product-oriented behaviors as they adopt new practices <span class="No-Break">and mindsets.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Evaluating project-centric behaviors</h2>
			<p>In project-centric<a id="_idIndexMarker404"/> environments, teams exhibit several distinct behaviors that shape their approach to work <span class="No-Break">and collaboration:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fixed scope emphasis</strong>: Teams prioritize delivering specific outputs within predefined constraints, focusing heavily on adherence to the original plan, budget, <span class="No-Break">and timeline.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Temporary teams</strong>: People are allocated to projects and disbanded upon completion. From project-to-project, team composition frequently changes, leading to potential disruptions in knowledge continuity and <span class="No-Break">team dynamics.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Change</strong> <strong class="bold">resistance</strong>: Change is often seen as a threat to the project’s scope, budgets, and timelines, leading to rigid change control processes that can <span class="No-Break">slow adaptation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Success</strong> <strong class="bold">metrics</strong>: Success is measured by the project’s adherence to predefined specifications, deadlines, and budget rather than long-term value or <span class="No-Break">customer satisfaction.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Siloed workflows</strong>: Work tends to occur in departmental or functional silos, with limited cross- functional collaboration, often resulting in hand-offs that can delay delivery and <span class="No-Break">reduce efficiency.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we’ve established a common understanding of project-centered behaviors, let’s explore how these behaviors evolve as organizations transition toward product-centric <span class="No-Break">development strategies.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>Transitioning behaviors</h2>
			<p>As organizations transition toward product-centric development<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> strategies, they exhibit transitional behaviors<a id="_idIndexMarker406"/> characterized by a shift toward balanced priorities, flexible team structures, openness to change, evolving success metrics, and integrated workflows. Let’s explore these behaviors in <span class="No-Break">more detail.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Balanced priorities</strong>: Organizations begin to balance the need for delivering specific project outputs with understanding the broader impact on customer value and <span class="No-Break">strategic goals.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flexible team structures</strong>: There’s an increased emphasis on stable, cross-functional teams, though they may still be project-bound. Teams start to form around capabilities <span class="No-Break">and products.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Openness</strong> <strong class="bold">to</strong> <strong class="bold">change</strong>: Changes are managed more flexibly, with a growing understanding that adaptation can lead to better outcomes. Iterative methodologies such as Agile may <span class="No-Break">facilitate this.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Evolving success metrics</strong>: While traditional project metrics remain important, there’s an increasing focus on measures such as customer feedback and <span class="No-Break">market impact.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrated</strong> <strong class="bold">workflows</strong>: Efforts to break down silos begin, with increased emphasis on collaboration across functions and stages <span class="No-Break">of work.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we progress through the transition<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> from project-centric to product-centric <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>behaviors, let’s now explore the transformative shift toward product-centric approaches. Here, teams prioritize continuous value delivery, embrace change, and foster <span class="No-Break">seamless collaboration.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>Contrasting product-centric behaviors</h2>
			<p>As organizations transition<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> to product-centric behaviors, they prioritize continuous value delivery, embrace change, and foster seamless collaboration. For example, they focus on enabling flow demanded by a continuous, holistic product focus as <span class="No-Break">described below.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer and market focus</strong>: Teams are primarily focused on delivering continuous value to customers and responding to market changes. The scope is flexible and evolves based on feedback <span class="No-Break">and insights.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Persistent,</strong> <strong class="bold">cross-functional</strong> <strong class="bold">teams</strong>: Teams are stable, long-term, and organized around products or services. They possess all the necessary skills to deliver value <span class="No-Break">from end-to-end.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Embrace change</strong>: Change is seen as an opportunity to learn and improve. Teams rapidly adapt based on real-world feedback, using method such as continuous delivery <span class="No-Break">and deployment.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value-based success metrics</strong>: Success is measured by the product’s impact on the market, customer satisfaction, and the ability to deliver business outcomes over the <span class="No-Break">long term.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Seamless</strong> <strong class="bold">collaboration</strong>: Workflows are highly integrated, with a strong emphasis on transparency, communication, and collaboration across all levels and functions within <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Product-based organizations<a id="_idIndexMarker410"/> are in a constant state of evolution, moving from rigid, project structures and behaviors towards more dynamic, product-oriented models that prioritize agility, customer value, and <span class="No-Break">sustainable growth.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s examine flow at different levels, macro and micro, to enable the greater emphasis on flow that continuous, holistic, <span class="No-Break">product-focus demands.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>Understanding flow at organizational and individual levels</h1>
			<p>In this subsection, we explore <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>how identifying constraints within processes and employing principles such as the theory of constraints, Lean flow, and metrics can systematically address these challenges, leading to a more efficient and effective flow of work and value creation. Addressing these challenges helps us achieve more with fewer resources, maintain high-quality standards, deliver enhanced customer value, foster employee satisfaction, and <span class="No-Break">accelerate deliveries.</span></p>
			<p>As we explore the process of streamlining value streams, we must examine two distinct levels of flow: the <strong class="bold">macro</strong> <strong class="bold">level</strong>, encompassing the organization’s collective workflow, and the <strong class="bold">micro</strong> <strong class="bold">level</strong>, focusing on individual employees’ personal <span class="No-Break">work experiences.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s take a closer look at these levels to gain a comprehensive understanding of how optimizing flow can lead to improved efficiency <span class="No-Break">and satisfaction:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Macro</strong> <strong class="bold">level</strong> <strong class="bold">(collective</strong> <strong class="bold">flow)</strong>: This perspective includes the entire<a id="_idIndexMarker412"/> organization’s workflows, which ensures cohesion and efficiency. Like a relay race, these flows involve a synchronized, cross-organizational flow that allows work to progress rapidly and efficiently through the usual stages of planning, developing, testing, and deploying. This macro approach reflects how lean flow principles improve productivity and efficiency while leveraging Agile’s iterative and incremental planning process, fostering adaptability and evolution across our value stream flows. The macro level effectively represents a view of our value <span class="No-Break">stream flows.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Micro level (personal flow)</strong>: On an individual level, flow<a id="_idIndexMarker413"/> relates to an employee’s work experience. It involves uninterrupted time, deep and focused work without the risk of burnout, a dedication to one’s area of expertise, and the need for acknowledgment. The personal flow is illustrated by the balance between challenge and skill, which is fundamental to achieving joy and satisfaction at work, as depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.3</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Both the macro and micro levels of flow are critically interdependent. Enhancing flow within an organization should include efforts to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Reduce delays</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Lower friction</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Increase engagement</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Boost performance</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>When seeking improvement, people often tend to concentrate on either the macro or micro aspects. However, both aspects must be considered simultaneously to establish high-performance systems. When addressing the macro level, measure the impact on the individual and <span class="No-Break">vice versa.</span></p>
			<p>As we explore optimizing<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> value streams further, our next step is to identify obstacles to flow. These challenges obstruct work, create confusion, and reduce productivity. By identifying the most frequent types of flow interruptions, we can understand why unintentional value streams form. Recognizing and eliminating these obstacles is necessary because they persist when the flow isn’t intentionally<a id="_idIndexMarker415"/> designed to <span class="No-Break">avoid them.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>Identifying obstacles to streamlined workflows</h2>
			<p>Making value flow without interruption<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> is the first step to optimizing flow, as obstacles persist when workflows lack intentional design to address these problems. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.3 </em>depicts typical challenges, highlighting how they impede the efficient delivery of products <span class="No-Break">a<a id="_idTextAnchor337"/>nd services:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.3 – The path to value often winds through a maze of challenges</p>
			<p>The following is a list of typical impediments <span class="No-Break">to flow:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of clarity</strong>: This causes confusion and misdirection, leading to wasted effort and resources, as team members may not understand the goals <span class="No-Break">or processes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Unclear approvals</strong>: Unclear approvals cause delays and bottlenecks in a value stream, disrupting the smooth flow <span class="No-Break">of processes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Frequent handoffs</strong>: This disrupts the flow by increasing the chances of miscommunication, delays, and errors. They can lead to inefficiencies and cause longer overall <span class="No-Break">process time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bottlenecks</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">queues</strong>: They slow progress as tasks get queued, waiting for previous activities to be completed, reducing overall efficiency and increasing <span class="No-Break">lead times.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dependencies</strong>: You may encounter a situation where one team’s work is blocked while another team’s related work is completed. These handoffs typically occur when there is a gap in responsibility, knowledge, collaboration, and <span class="No-Break">fast feedback.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Excessive</strong> <strong class="bold">work</strong> <strong class="bold">in</strong> <strong class="bold">process</strong> <strong class="bold">(WIP)</strong>: Too much WIP causes priorities and resources to be shuffled, tasks to be frequently switched, and operating expenses to increase. It reduces productivity and throughput and increases wait times for <span class="No-Break">new functionality.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rework</strong>: This is a waste of time and resources, as completed work needs to be done again due to errors or changes <span class="No-Break">in requirements.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technical debt</strong>: The cost of deferring fixes or addressing identified issues, which leads to increased maintenance costs and reduced agility over time as accumulated shortcuts or incomplete solutions must be <span class="No-Break">corrected later.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Escalations</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">interruptions</strong>: These distract from planned work, often requiring immediate<a id="_idIndexMarker417"/> attention, disrupting workflow, and leading to <span class="No-Break">project delays.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next subsection, we will explore how aligning work to value streams helps overcome <span class="No-Break">these obstacles.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor338"/>Seeing the organization in terms of flow</h2>
			<p>Eliminating the constraints<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> imposed by traditional hierarchical structures improves productivity and efficiency, enabling a smoother flow of work across functional silos. Dr. Melvin Conway’s article in Datamation, titled <em class="italic">‘How Do Committees Invent?</em>’, discusses the relationship between organizational and technical design. His conclusion was that “<em class="italic">Organizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations</em>.” <span class="superscript">2</span> Simply put, the architecture of a system mirrors the communication structure of the organization that <span class="No-Break">designed it.</span></p>
			<p>What does Conway’s law mean in practice? “<em class="italic">Suppose the technology department at ABC Insurance has three main workgroups: one focused on insurance claims, a second for underwriting, and a third for actuarial analysis. Conway’s law predicts that your system design will mirror your organizational structure and communication pathways. In turn, there will be a separate software module for each of these three capabilities. Each will likely have a unique architecture, design, infrastructure, and systems integration protocols. The implications of team structure on architecture are often overlooked. The team’s organizational design should align with the desired technical architecture, not the other </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">way around.</em></span><span class="No-Break">”</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">3</span></span></p>
			<p>In traditional hierarchical<a id="_idIndexMarker419"/> and domain-based structures, work tends to align with these siloed teams and departments. It obstructs visibility into how value flows across the organization, making it challenging to see bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the additional cross-departmental and cross-functional processes required to overcome these silos create <strong class="bold">excess processing waste</strong>, which means doing more work or adding more components than necessary to meet customer requirements. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.4 </em>depicts traditional hierarchical <span class="No-Break">organizational structures:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer066">
					<img alt="Figure 6.4 – Siloed organizational structures" src="image/B21818_06_04.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.4 – Siloed organizational structures</p>
			<p>Traditional organizational structures are typically function- or domain-based, resulting in siloed processes, hindering workflows, and adding complexity across functions and departmental operations. As a result, organizations often need additional processes and systems to facilitate <span class="No-Break">inter-departmental workflows.</span></p>
			<p>To break free from these traditional structures and embrace a value stream perspective, organizations can streamline their processes, enhance collaboration, and achieve greater efficiency. However, that means ignoring the dogma associated with the traditional hierarchical model as the only way to organize work. In many cases, aligning resources along your organization’s product and service flows will make more sense, working backward from the customer outcomes you aim to deliver. We’ll show an example of that in the context of a <span class="No-Break">customer journey.</span></p>
			<p>Instead of adhering to conventional structures, organizations must chart a definitive course toward value creation. This requires an examination of value stream flows that transcend departmental divisions. An organization’s structural rigidity often hampers the fluidity necessary for seamless value delivery, as workflows are frequently hindered by compartmentalization and siloed practices. To address this issue, first conceptualize your value stream and then overlay it on top of the conventional <span class="No-Break">hierarchical model.</span></p>
			<p>In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em>, the highlighted line shows how value<a id="_idIndexMarker420"/> flows across a traditional hierarchy. As you can see, no single function or department can deliver a product or <span class="No-Break">service independently:</span></p>

			<p>When you map the workflow across your organization, you will find significant waste and inefficiencies. However, when we flatten this hierarchy and visualize the flow as a path from concept to value delivery, value flows smoothly <span class="No-Break">without interruption.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.6 </em>highlights the importance of streamlining flows across business functions. After all, a straight line is always the shortest path to <span class="No-Break">a destination:</span></p>

Additionally, many of the downstream issues result from invisible upstream problems that are unaddressed. The efficiency of a value stream is not solely determined by its automation, integration, and synchronization downstream. Its effectiveness is also contingent on a steady influx of new work identified<a id="_idIndexMarker421"/> and refined adequately. Without this, our streamlined value streams can <span class="No-Break">become underutilized.</span></p>
			<h4>Value streams – embracing continuous improvement in software delivery</h4>
			<p>In software development, adopting<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> value-stream thinking and organization fosters continuous improvement. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.7 </em>illustrates an oversimplified value stream for delivering software from concept <span class="No-Break">to support:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.7 – Software development life cycle</p>
			<p>The software development lifecycle shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.7 </em>is a simplified representation of the flow of work within a single value stream. The overarching objective of leveraging value streams is to achieve a comprehensive understanding and ultimate design of a discrete workflow delivering customer value. This perspective helps identify potential process bottlenecks at the system level, facilitating more informed decision-making, optimizing resources, and avoiding local- optimization. In <a href="B21818_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor355"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, we’ll go further to define the interconnected network of value streams at the <span class="No-Break">organizational level.</span></p>
			<p>By identifying and optimizing the flow of value, teams can address inefficiencies and prioritize customer satisfaction. This underscores the importance of value streams in elevating software delivery practices and preparing the groundwork for a deeper discussion on optimizing software development workflows for <span class="No-Break">better outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>Once you progress beyond the disruptive project model of pulling contributors together to work on a finite effort, improving performance becomes a regular and critical pursuit. Product and service delivery value streams provide an effective structure to leverage Lean–Agile practices to improve performance. Additionally, portfolios of products and services are delivered by a network of value streams that can be effectively mapped, measured, and intentionally designed for <span class="No-Break">peak performance.</span></p>
			<p>Investment in long-lived and evolving products and services demands the sustained measurement and refinement of performance through these value streams. It advocates for employing metrics that gauge efficiency, quality, and customer fulfillment to enable continuous improvement. This strategy is particularly pertinent amidst the shift from traditional project approaches to Lean product software development methods, which prioritize ongoing<a id="_idIndexMarker423"/> value delivery to customers over the completion of <span class="No-Break">isolated projects.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor339"/>Creating pathways to value – understanding and identifying value streams</h2>
			<p>Within an organization <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>lies a complex network of value streams, each serving as a vital channel for delivering value to both internal and external customers. Recognizing these streams is crucial, yet it can be a complex task for organizations unfamiliar with the concept or evolving toward a <span class="No-Break">value-oriented framework.</span></p>
			<p>To demystify these streams, begin with the customer outcomes that signify success for the organization. A customer outcome, which goes beyond the general idea of customer satisfaction, identifies the exact value provided, such as a feature’s utilization, new customer acquisition, or a <span class="No-Break">completed sale.</span></p>
			<p>Consider the sales process, an internal value stream that mirrors a customer’s journey in evaluating their business or user needs, reviewing competitive offerings, and making informed purchasing decisions. This process experiences variable lead times, influenced by factors such as customer product reviews, competitive value analysis, and buying processes. While inherently operational, the sales-oriented value stream remains adaptable and open to improvement through Agile methodologies applied to organizational CRM tools, sales processes, pre-sales roles, availability of competitive and customer information, and <span class="No-Break">product capabilities.</span></p>
			<p>In the previous subsection, we emphasized the significance of superimposing a value stream across our organizational structures to better appreciate how work flows. But how do we define the value stream in the first place? Discovering a value stream involves a reverse journey from the customer outcome, inquiring about the processes and decisions that lead to the realization of that outcome. This backward journey often leads to the source of the process, which could be a customer request, a stakeholder’s need, or an output from another <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<p>Initiating our value stream design by first defining what our customers want ensures that we stay aligned with their needs throughout the process. As we map the journey backward customer delivery upstream across our value stream flow to the initial order, we continuously inquire about the information and other product or service components that must be delivered at each stage of our value stream. This iterative approach guides us step by step, eventually leading us all the way back to the point of the initial customer order or request. It serves as a customer-centric foundation upon which we trigger our value <span class="No-Break">stream flow.</span></p>
			<p>In the process of optimizing our software delivery pipeline, we work our way backward<a id="_idIndexMarker425"/> through each phase of the <strong class="bold">software development life cycle </strong>(<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>). Our goal is to ensure that each stage is seamlessly integrated and aligned with the principles of customer-centric value stream design. To achieve this, we incorporate the essential elements of value streams: people, process, information, and technology. As we navigate our way upstream from support all the way back to concept or the initial order/request—we will define the critical components that contribute to a robust and efficient software<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> <span class="No-Break">development process.</span></p>
			<p>This backward exploration of value stream flows is not strictly applied to software delivery pipelines. All value steams need to be assessed in this manner to make informed improvements. Ideally, software delivery teams participate in these assessments to evaluate areas where software enhancements can improve the targeted <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<p>Once identified, value streams<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> become concrete elements that an organization can optimize to improve value delivery. They are actionable avenues where businesses can exercise control to transform customer interactions into reliable, gratifying experiences that propel <span class="No-Break">organizational success.</span></p>
			<p>By mapping these streams, an organization not only gains insight into its operational status quo but also lays the groundwork for targeted enhancements that streamline the flow of value. Embracing this method promotes ongoing improvement to enhance each stream and amplify <span class="No-Break">customer value.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor340"/>Charting pathways to value – identifying value streams</h2>
			<p>Identifying value streams<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> within an organization is like charting a course through a complex landscape. It begins with pinpointing<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> the destination—what we refer to as the target outcome. This is the summit where value is perceived and realized by the customer. To reach this peak, one must consider the product or service being offered and the journey the customer undertakes to interact with <span class="No-Break">this offering.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.8 </em>illustrates three potential starting points: target outcome, a specific product/service, or <span class="No-Break">customer journey:</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.8 - Identifying value streams</p>
			<p>To truly map out the value streams, we must delve into the questions that dissect the delivery mechanism of our products and services. It is essential to ask certain questions: how is value delivered? How do we measure it? What triggers the start of a new delivery? What are key value stream metrics? How do we gauge our successes after delivery? By answering these questions, the value streams begin to emerge, revealing not just the flow of value but also the obstacles, friction points, and challenges that may impede <span class="No-Break">its progress.</span></p>
			<p>Consideration of your objectives, goals, and targets frames the context for this exploration. The context is crucial—it gives perspective to the value stream, distinguishing it from mere processes by its purposeful orientation toward <span class="No-Break">delivering outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>Products and services act as vessels carrying value, and their selection can serve as an entry point in understanding the associated value streams. Whether one looks at a comprehensive product catalog or zeroes in on a specific offering, the objective remains to map the path back from the customer to the source of <span class="No-Break">its creation.</span></p>
			<p>The customer journey encompasses all interactions and experiences a customer encounters, from initial awareness to post-purchase interactions. Mapping this journey reveals touchpoints where the organization interacts with customers, influences their experience, and offers opportunities to enhance value delivery. By tracing these touchpoints backward, we unveil the underlying <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>When these elements—target<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> outcomes, products and services, and the customer journey—are considered together, an even clearer picture begins to form. The streams become visible, flowing from the source of creation to the point of customer interaction. It is along these streams that we can navigate, optimize, and innovate to ensure that the journey to performance improvement is as smooth and as enriching <span class="No-Break">as possible.</span></p>
			<p>In the upcoming subsection, you will gain valuable insights into the essential roles and responsibilities involved in value stream mapping. Specifically, we will explore how each key player contributes to the success of the mapping effort in the context of a mobile application project, where their collective expertise is leveraged to optimize the value stream and enhance <span class="No-Break">operational efficiency.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor341"/>Mapping flow</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Value stream</strong> <strong class="bold">mapping </strong>(<strong class="bold">VS mapping</strong>) is a strategic exercise in business process improvement <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>that is crucial for visualizing the flow of materials and information and working on the creation and delivery of a product or service. The clarity of roles and responsibilities is essential for the success of VSM, as depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em>, which outlines the key players in the VSM initiative for a mobile <span class="No-Break">application project.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.9 – Roles involved in value stream mapping</p>
			<p>In the following list of VS mapping roles, we introduce the crucial participants in a VS mapping exercise. Each plays a distinct role in visualizing and improving the flow of materials, information, and work in the creation and delivery of products or services. These roles represent crucial contributors to any cross-functional, end-to-end effort to improve flow and <span class="No-Break">value delivery:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">VSM</strong> <strong class="bold">facilitator</strong>: The facilitator is central to the VSM initiative<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> and is responsible for guiding the team through the mapping process. This individual ensures that the mapping activities are conducted methodically, encourages participation, and ensures that all voices are heard and documented. The facilitator may be the value stream leader assigned to support the value stream or an external expert in lean-oriented VS <span class="No-Break">mapping practices.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Executive</strong> <strong class="bold">sponsor</strong>: The executive sponsor provides the VSM initiative with its directive and mandate. Their role is to secure resources, overcome organizational resistance, and empower the team with the authority needed to carry out the mapping and subsequent <span class="No-Break">improvement initiatives.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product</strong> <strong class="bold">owners,</strong> <strong class="bold">UI/UX</strong> <strong class="bold">designers,</strong> <strong class="bold">developers,</strong> <strong class="bold">quality</strong> <strong class="bold">assurance</strong> <strong class="bold">(QA),</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">testers</strong>: These functional roles provide their perspective as contributors to qualify and quantify what is happening in the flow of work, how it performs, and where<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> they see issues <span class="No-Break">and opportunities.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each step of the flow, starting from the final outcome and working backward to inception, is mapped, analyzed, and optimized to ensure that the value stream is as lean and efficient as possible, minimizing waste and maximizing value to <span class="No-Break">the customer.</span></p>
			<p>Through VSM, the collective<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> expertise of these roles is leveraged to dissect and understand the end-to-end process, identify inefficiencies, and improve the flow of value. This collaborative effort is instrumental in creating a flow that not only meets customer expectations but also contributes to the organization’s competitive edge and <span class="No-Break">operational excellence.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor342"/>Inspecting efficiency and effectiveness</h2>
			<p>When we map and inspect<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> value streams, we must consider both value stream efficiency and effectiveness <em class="italic">as shown in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.10</em>. These results could encompass various aspects such as streamlined workflows, improved customer experience, value delivery, financial performance, and the impact on organizational outcomes. </p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer072">
					<img alt="Figure 6.10 – ﻿Workflow versus value realization" src="image/B21818_06_10.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.10 – Workflow versus value realization</p>
			<p>On one side, we have <strong class="bold">efficiency</strong>, which focuses on the performance of internal processes. Outputs such as rate of flow, frequency of delivery, waste in the value stream, and types of work underway are critical indicators of a value stream’s health. These metrics are essential for gauging how well the internal processes are functioning and how efficiently value is being delivered through the <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<p>Transitioning to <strong class="bold">effectiveness</strong>, the emphasis shifts<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> to business outcomes, particularly in terms of customer experience. Here, outcomes are most important. For example: active usage of the platform’s capabilities by customers, the rate at which new customers are acquired, direct customer feedback on their experiences, and the financial health of the value stream are all vital signs of how effectively the organization is delivering value to its customers <span class="No-Break">and stakeholders.</span></p>
			<p>It’s important to maintain<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> a balance between streamlined workflows and accelerated business outcomes. It’s not enough to be efficient internally; an organization must also ensure that this efficiency translates into real-world effectiveness that customers can feel and appreciate. This balance is the cornerstone of a thriving value stream and, ultimately, a <span class="No-Break">successful business.</span></p>
			<h4>Balancing innovation and efficiency in value streams</h4>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.11 </em>illustrates a crucial dimension<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> for classifying and influencing organizational value streams: the balance between innovation and operational efficiency. It underscores the importance of recognizing where each value stream falls on the spectrum, from a focus on disruptive innovation to a commitment to stability <span class="No-Break">and efficiency:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer073">
					<img alt="Figure 6.11 – The spectrum of performance focus" src="image/B21818_06_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.11 – The spectrum of performance focus</p>
			<h3>The drive for effectiveness and innovation</h3>
			<p>At one end of the<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> spectrum, as shown on the left in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure</em></span><span class="No-Break"> </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">6</em></span><em class="italic">.12</em>, we have value streams delivering products and services that are unique and novel and differentiate the organization’s offerings from the competition. This is where innovation and disruption <span class="No-Break">are born:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer074">
					<img alt="Figure 6.12 – Streams can be plotted to place them in relative context" src="image/B21818_06_12.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.12 – Streams can be plotted to place them in relative context</p>
			<p>These are areas where the organization is actively seeking to break new ground, often characterized by new capabilities, experimentation, and exploration of new practices. The emphasis here is on creating value through innovation and embracing change to stay ahead of <span class="No-Break">market trends.</span></p>
			<h3>The drive for efficiency and stability</h3>
			<p>Conversely, on the opposite<a id="_idIndexMarker440"/> end, we find processes such as billing, infrastructure services, payroll, and human resources. These are established, highly commoditized practices that prioritize efficiency, stability, and predictability. In such domains, the goal is to refine and optimize, reducing variation and increasing margins through operational cost efficiencies. These value streams are mature, well-evolved areas where consistency and security are paramount, and the focus is on maximizing profitability through standardization. At the extreme, they may be so commoditized and standardized that they are most<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> beneficial as an <span class="No-Break">outsourced capability.</span></p>
			<h3>The dynamic nature of value streams</h3>
			<p>What’s particularly noteworthy<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> here is that value streams are not static. They can shift positions across this spectrum over time, either through deliberate strategic repositioning or as a response to evolving market and internal conditions. The recognition that value streams can transition between focusing on innovation and efficiency opens up possibilities for strategic management and <span class="No-Break">intentional transformation.</span></p>
			<h3>Implications across organizational dimensions</h3>
			<p>This spectrum has far-reaching<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> implications, affecting creativity, exploration, operational management, and resource allocation. It informs the approach to leadership, investment in technology, and process development. Understanding where a value stream sits on this continuum is critical for aligning organizational efforts with broader <span class="No-Break">strategic objectives.</span></p>
			<h4>Contextualizing performance focus</h4>
			<p>In essence, this visualization<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> is a strategic tool that helps leaders understand and direct the evolution of value streams within their organization. It provides insight into how to foster an environment where innovation can thrive without sacrificing the operational excellence necessary for <span class="No-Break">long-term success.</span></p>
			<p>Using FinOps and billing as representative points on this spectrum helps to contextualize the diverse nature of value streams. While FinOps may be situated toward the innovation end – continually adapting and evolving, billing would typically be found toward the operational efficiency end – emphasizing reliability <span class="No-Break">and cost-effectiveness.</span></p>
			<p>Using this spectrum, you can discuss what it might mean to shift a value stream further toward one end or another and what targets and behaviors might enable that. We’ll discuss how targets, metrics, and measures drive this change in the following section. Moreover, in the following chapter, we’ll show how this deep commitment to learning. Here, the work processes are more experimental, spectrum forms the backbone for mapping your organization as a network, as well as the strategic and tactical implications of your value<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> stream <span class="No-Break">network map.</span></p>
			<h4>Striking the balance – from learning to results in value streams</h4>
			<p>When exploring the strategic<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> dynamics within<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> an organization, one can consider a continuum that spans from the <strong class="bold">flow of learning (Explore) </strong>to the <strong class="bold">flow of results (Exploit)</strong>, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.13</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer075">
					<img alt="Figure 6.13 – Spanning the spectrum from the flow of learning to the flow of results" src="image/B21818_06_13.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.13 – Spanning the spectrum from the flow of learning to the flow of results</p>
			<p>At the left end of this continuum lies the realm of innovation and effectiveness, characterized by a deep commitment to learning. Here, the work processes are more experimental, exploratory, and often disruptive. It’s an environment where ideas are incubated and nurtured over time, and gaining acceptance for a groundbreaking innovation is considered a desirable outcome. The focus is on long-term value creation rather than immediate returns. This approach can be more time-consuming and less about immediate efficiency, but the potential for transformative outcomes can justify the investment in learning <span class="No-Break">and experimentation.</span></p>
			<p>To the right of the spectrum, the focus becomes efficiency and sustainable delivery—the flow of results. Here, the emphasis is on speed of delivery, predictability, and consistency. Value streams operating at this end often manage a backlog of mostly uniform tasks that need to be processed with high efficiency and effectiveness. The primary goal is to drive down costs and streamline processes to maximize output. Also, the ability to increase margins is more constrained, as there’s a limit to how much one can optimize existing processes<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> without introducing new innovations<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> or <span class="No-Break">disruptive methods.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>Refining the process – questions for progress</h2>
			<p>Another critical point<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> to consider is that <em class="italic">Figures 6.11</em> to <em class="italic">6.13</em> underscore a fundamental principle: the coordinates at which a stream is placed within this bi-dimensional framework directly result from what it does, prioritizes, and measures. However, these figures do not show how a stream might move after considering the results of priority and measurement. To shift a stream, the team adjusts its priorities and measurements. As a result, we can see not only the present flow of activities but also a future state flow by defining changes to targets that drive changes <span class="No-Break">in behavior.</span></p>
			<p>Paraphrasing the teachings of Eliyahu M. Goldratt, the author of <em class="italic">The</em> <em class="italic">Goal</em> and<a id="_idIndexMarker451"/> the developer of the <strong class="bold">theory</strong> <strong class="bold">of</strong> <strong class="bold">constraints</strong>, it can be said that “<em class="italic">the elements an organization chooses to measure will inevitably align with its achievements</em>.” He is also often quoted as saying, “<em class="italic">Show me how you’ll measure me, and I’ll show you how I’ll behave</em>.” Said another way, your outcomes are a downstream effect of what you measure upstream. This is because the act of measurement does more than just record data—it focuses attention and resources, dictating what the organization will <span class="No-Break">actually execute.</span></p>
			<p>So, with this information, we can answer these questions on the value of metrics <span class="No-Break">and measurements:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why do metrics and <span class="No-Break">measurements matter?</span><p class="list-inset">Understanding the influence of metrics and measurement on organizational positioning is not just an academic exercise; it is crucial to tangible progress in any business domain. It matters because the metrics we prioritize are the rudders steering our collective efforts. They shape our decision-making processes, influence our resource allocation, and ultimately define our <span class="No-Break">success criteria.</span></p></li>
				<li>How do we release <span class="No-Break">more often?</span><p class="list-inset">To enhance the frequency of our releases, we should focus on the efficiency of our release mechanisms. By measuring the lead time and the proportion of automated processes versus manual interventions, we can identify bottlenecks. Tracking the influence of constraints and the handoffs between teams can reveal inefficiencies and areas ripe <span class="No-Break">for innovation.</span></p></li>
				<li>How can we change the way <span class="No-Break">we work?</span><p class="list-inset">Effective alteration of our work methods requires a shift in what we measure. By setting new performance indicators, we influence behaviors and reshape the operational model. The focus of the team naturally shifts to align with these new metrics, driving them to adapt their approaches and innovate <span class="No-Break">their practices.</span></p></li>
				<li>What if we want to <span class="No-Break">change [variable]?</span><p class="list-inset">If a change is desired in a specific area, noted as “[variable]” in the question, it is essential to start by identifying the relevant metrics that can trigger a change in that domain. Measure the current state, set a target for the desired state, and monitor progress against those metrics. This structured approach to change can catalyze a shift in behavior, workflows, and, <span class="No-Break">ultimately, outcomes.</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By revisiting what<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> we measure, we do not just change numbers on a dashboard; we instigate a culture of transformation that permeates through the layers of our organizational practice, altering the way we operate, innovate, and grow. The act of measurement, therefore, is not just a reflective tool but a formative one—it shapes the path we take toward <span class="No-Break">our aspirations.</span></p>
			<p>Now let’s move on to introduce five steps to optimize our <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor344"/>Optimizing value streams</h2>
			<p>The E9 VSM Methodology<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> presented in <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a> offers a robust approach to conducting a VSM engagement. But for the purposes of this chapter, we can simplify it. For example, <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.14</em> presents a streamlined view of value stream management, encapsulating the essential steps for optimizing <span class="No-Break">business processes:</span></p>
			<div>

					<img alt="Figure 6.14 – The flow of value stream management" src="image/B21818_06_14.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.14 – The flow of value stream management</p>
			<p>The objectives for<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> each of the five key <span class="No-Break">steps are:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Clarify</strong> <strong class="bold">your</strong> <strong class="bold">target</strong>: Establish a clear goal that your value stream efforts aim to achieve. This will set the direction for all subsequent actions <span class="No-Break">and decisions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identify stream and contributors</strong>: Determine the specific value stream that aligns with your target and recognize the contributors who influence the flow <span class="No-Break">of value.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assess</strong> <strong class="bold">the</strong> <strong class="bold">current</strong> <strong class="bold">state</strong>: Evaluate the present condition of your value stream to understand where you stand in relation to <span class="No-Break">your target.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Find</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">measure</strong> <strong class="bold">key</strong> <strong class="bold">constraints</strong>: Identify and quantify the bottlenecks that are hindering your value stream. Understanding these constraints is critical to prioritizing efforts <span class="No-Break">for improvement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Address</strong> <strong class="bold">constraints</strong> <strong class="bold">with</strong> <strong class="bold">capabilities</strong>: Utilize available capabilities to resolve the constraints, thereby enhancing the performance and efficiency of your <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This approach to value stream management facilitates a focused and effective strategy for process improvement, ensuring that efforts are aligned with desired outcomes. Still, we need to keep in mind why we are executing these five steps to streamline <span class="No-Break">value deliveries.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor345"/>Streamlining value delivery</h2>
			<p>Navigating through the intricacies<a id="_idIndexMarker455"/> of value stream management requires a focus on several pivotal elements that ensure a seamless and dynamic flow of value to <span class="No-Break">the customer:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delivery focus</strong>: The core emphasis lies in the sustainable delivery of value. This involves a persistent commitment to not just planning or outlining the value streams but operationalizing and executing <span class="No-Break">them efficiently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Topology</strong> <strong class="bold">supporting</strong> <strong class="bold">value</strong> <strong class="bold">streams</strong>: A well-defined team topology is the foundation of successful value streams. The interaction of multiple teams within a network facilitates a comprehensive, interconnected system that propels value <span class="No-Break">delivery forward.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Set new targets</strong>: Shifting the performance focus necessitates setting new targets and benchmarks. By altering what is measured and expected, behaviors and outcomes within the value stream are redirected toward the <span class="No-Break">desired change.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Visualize flow across the organization</strong>: It is crucial to understand and see the flow of value not just in isolated pockets but across the entire organizational structure. This broad perspective is essential for a holistic approach to value stream management, ensuring that all parts of the organization are aligned and contributing to the flow <span class="No-Break">of value.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we have explored various strategies for inspecting, refining, and optimizing value stream operations, we have one last dimension to define where our value streams sit within our organization - which <span class="No-Break">is evolution.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor346"/>Managing value stream evolution</h1>
			<p>In this section, we show how to chart<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> the dynamics of value stream flows and explore strategies for optimizing their performance. By mapping value streams, organizations gain a clear understanding of their <span class="No-Break">improvement opportunities.</span></p>
			<p>Specifically, we continue to examine the two dimensions of customer proximity and operational focus. Through this two-dimensional network of value streams, we expose the complex interplay of organizational activities. This network view empowers leaders to pinpoint each value stream’s position relative to its strategic importance and <span class="No-Break">operational emphasis.</span></p>
			<p>We also explore how value streams vary in their customer visibility and operational focus, from customer-centric, front-facing elements such as mobile banking to highly efficient yet less customer- visible processes such as billing. This mapping isn’t just a static representation; it’s a dynamic model that reflects the fluid nature of <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we will examine how changes in one area can ripple through the network, influencing adjacent streams. Whether<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> it’s the introduction of innovative <strong class="bold">financial operations </strong>(<strong class="bold">FinOps</strong>), the automation of platforms, or the deliberate strategic repositioning of value streams, each connection represents a decision point where the balance between innovation and efficiency must be managed. Understanding these interconnected dynamics is crucial for strategic agility, aligning internal processes with organizational goals, and delivering value to both customers and <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll start this section with a discussion on how value stream mapping helps organizations align customer-centric innovation with operational efficiency, guiding strategic decisions for a cohesive and <span class="No-Break">efficient operation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor347"/>Synchronizing core and supportive workflows</h2>
			<p>In this subsection, we continue<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> with our mobile app use case to demonstrate how external-facing core value stream processes can translate into supporting value streams for internal customers. Here, we will find that numerous support value streams can be created to assist the core, depending on activities that require operational or <span class="No-Break">development-oriented support.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.15 </em>illustrates the interplay between core and supportive streams within our organizational workflow. It depicts the flow of work across standard development value stream processes. The dotted lines provide visibility to where efficiencies can be gained and where efforts may <span class="No-Break">be diluted.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer077">
					<img alt="Figure 6.15 – Core and supportive streams" src="image/B21818_06_15.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.15 – Core and supportive streams</p>
			<p>Core streams directly engage<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> with external customers, delivering the final products or services that define our market presence. These streams are depicted through the mobile app process flow, which includes the <strong class="bold">Planning</strong>, <strong class="bold">Design</strong>, <strong class="bold">Develop</strong>, <strong class="bold">Test</strong>, <strong class="bold">Deliver</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Enable </strong>phases. The proximity of the core streams to the end users is a fundamental concept, as it indicates that the deliverables are closely aligned with the customers’ needs <span class="No-Break">and expectations.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, supportive streams function internally, providing essential capabilities that empower the core streams. These supportive<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> streams, illustrated as <strong class="bold">Design Platform </strong>and <strong class="bold">Security Platform</strong>, undergo a similar process<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> flow, ensuring that the capabilities they develop are robust and align with the overarching goals of the core streams. These platforms undergo their own <strong class="bold">Planning </strong>to <strong class="bold">Enable </strong>phases, ensuring a structured and thorough approach to internal <span class="No-Break">service provision.</span></p>
			<p>As another example, the design platform may offer tools and frameworks that enhance the <strong class="bold">Develop</strong> phase of the mobile app, while the security platform provides security protocols and infrastructure crucial for the mobile app’s <strong class="bold">Test</strong> and <strong class="bold">Deliver</strong> stages. This symbiotic relationship is vital for internal customer satisfaction and for maintaining a <span class="No-Break">seamless workflow.</span></p>

This approach promotes agility, accelerates development, and enhances overall efficiency within <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p>As Lean-Agile teams and individuals navigate their way through the currents of change, they bear witness to a profound transformation. This journey is characterized by a transition from a structure weighed down by dependencies to one that champions flow and autonomy. Let’s look at the progression of <span class="No-Break">this transformation.</span></p>
			<h4>Navigating dependencies with streamlining efforts</h4>
			<p>Improvement efforts often began with the installation of<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> Agile software development teams using Scrum, often entangled in the web of complex subsystems. Their days were punctuated by the push and pull of interdependencies, where the quest for progress was met with the inertia <span class="No-Break">of inefficiency.</span></p>
			<p>This was an era of disruption, a time when progress stumbled over the hurdles of hierarchical constraints. Software development teams integrated tools and systems and process automation to address these issues across the enterprise and then found it useful to apply these same capabilities within their own <span class="No-Break">IT domains.</span></p>
			<h4>Elevating teams with platform empowerment</h4>
			<p>Metaphorically, the winds<a id="_idIndexMarker469"/> of change brought forth the concept of platform teams, akin to architects laying down bridges over chasms of chaos. These platforms emerged as enablers of self-service, offering tools and capabilities that turned pipeline delivery obstacles into gateways. Stream-aligned teams, once hindered by the unpredictable tides of dependencies, now found themselves in a rhythm, a harmonious flow that resonated with <span class="No-Break">continuous delivery.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Stream-Aligned Teams: </p>
			<p class="callout">Cross-functional teams in software development organized around specific value streams or customer journeys, responsible for end-to-end delivery and continuous improvement of a particular aspect of the product or service, ensuring alignment with business goals and <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.16 </em>depicts our transition from isolated, function-based operations to cohesive, customer-centric value streams. It highlights the transformation from Agile team structures, which often operate across disparate systems, to stream-aligned teams.
