			<p class="author-quote">“Agility is the ability to adapt and respond to change … agile organizations view change as an opportunity, not a threat.”</p>
			<p class="author-quote">–Jim Highsmith</p>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor428"/>Whether you work in a commercial enterprise, non-profit, or government agency, staying competitive and relevant requires the ability to swiftly adapt and innovate to meet and exceed customer expectations. How can organizations not just survive but thrive amid <a id="_idIndexMarker680"/>constant change? This chapter introduces the <strong class="bold">Business Agility System for the Enterprise</strong> (<strong class="bold">BASE</strong>), a model designed to transform uncertainty into opportunity. The BASE drives continuous improvement by coordinating all facets of a company’s resources to enhance business processes, systems, products, <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<p>According to <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>the Business Agility Institute<a id="_idTextAnchor429"/>, <strong class="bold">business agility</strong> is “<em class="italic">a set of organizational capabilities, behaviors, and ways of working that grant businesses the freedom, flexibility, and resilience to achieve their purpose</em>.” Similarly, <strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>® defines business agility as “<em class="italic">the ability to compete and thrive in the digital age by swiftly responding to market changes and emerging opportunities with innovative, digitally-enabled </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">business solutions</em></span><span class="No-Break">.”</span></p>
			<p>Our world is changing rapidly, requiring businesses to adopt an innovative approach to product development. Within the BASE model, Lean’s flow-oriented practices improve productivity, efficiency, and quality, while Agile’s timeboxed practices help organizations implement <a id="_idIndexMarker682"/>a hypothesis-driven approach to innovation, value delivery, and digital transformation. The BASE coordinates the activities of multiple <strong class="bold">Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams</strong> (<strong class="bold">BLASTs</strong>) to deliver new increments of value on cadence. This approach involves continuous cycles of information gathering, informed decision-making, and experimentation to optimize outcomes with <span class="No-Break">available resources.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn how the BASE conceptual model facilitates enterprise-wide collaboration and prioritizes customer-centered value deliveries. BASE also implements a holistic approach to delivering <em class="italic">integrated increments</em>, coordinating efforts across <a id="_idIndexMarker683"/>business functions and value streams. It features a <strong class="bold">Virtuous Circle</strong>, where each positive event in the model reinforces the next, driving continuous improvement. This chapter describes how the BASE shapes the enterprise’s customer-centric value delivery approach and includes the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the BASE <span class="No-Break">conceptual model</span></li>
				<li>Establishing <span class="No-Break">customer-centric foundations</span></li>
				<li>Delivering value across the product <span class="No-Break">life cycle</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor430"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>There are no technical requirements to understand the content presented in this chapter. However, readers should understand the concepts presented in <a href="B21818_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams (BLASTs</em>), as these teams provide the structure and resources for incrementally implementing new value. Al Shalloway’s online books, at <a href="https://successengineering.works/books/">https://successengineering.works/books/</a>, also provide extensive details on BASE development, including descriptions of the <span class="No-Break">BLAST framework.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor431"/>Understanding the BASE conceptual model</h1>
			<p>BASE offers a carefully crafted Lean-Agile <strong class="bold">operating model</strong> to promote enterprise business agility. An <a id="_idIndexMarker684"/>operating model is a comprehensive framework that defines how an organization operates to deliver value to its customers and achieve its strategic objectives. It encompasses the organization’s structure, processes, systems, and culture, detailing the alignment of resources, technology, and workflows to support <span class="No-Break">its goals.</span></p>
			<p>The BASE model supports the dynamic nature of the product life cycle — the continuously changing and often unpredictable stages a product goes through from concept to market release to end of life. This dynamism can be due to many factors, such as evolving customer needs, technological advancements, market competition, regulatory changes, and customer feedback during development. BASE aims to deliver new customer value perpetually, provided it is economically viable to continue supporting the product <span class="No-Break">or service.</span></p>
			<p>A BASE solution <a id="_idIndexMarker685"/>typically starts as a <strong class="bold">minimal viable product</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>). Organizations should initially explore new product or service concepts by developing an MVP to design, build, and test a limited set of planned features, functions, and capabilities, and then test them with your customers and in the market. The MVP helps evaluate the product’s potential and assesses its viability through fast feedback from one or more customer segments in the <span class="No-Break">target market.</span></p>
			<p>The BASE <a id="_idIndexMarker686"/>implements value streams that deliver new increments of business value, starting with <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>an initial MVP followed by a series of <strong class="bold">minimum viable increments</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVIs</strong>), as illustrated in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 9</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>. Each MVI iteratively and incrementally enhances a business process, information system, a product, or a service, offering customers increased benefits over time. This leads to a higher perceived value and often provides a competitive advantage in <span class="No-Break">the market.</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.1 – Product development in a BASE value stream</p>
			<p>As noted in the previous paragraph, an MVI can also focus on implementing changes in business processes, systems, or other business-enabling artifacts that the organization uses to improve its operations. These changes compete for the organization’s limited resources; therefore, business priorities must be assessed alongside enhancements to products and services as part of the business value backlog. This is why we prefer the term “value manager” over “product owner” for the person responsible for managing the business <span class="No-Break">value backlog.</span></p>
			<p>As discussed in <a href="B21818_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams (BLASTs)</em>, MVIs often fail to provide a complete solution or may not warrant individual deployment due to cost considerations. Additionally, introducing partial features, functions, or incomplete processes could negatively affect customer satisfaction. Therefore, the BASE conceptual model also incorporates the concept of a <strong class="bold">minimum viable release</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVR</strong>) to synchronize <a id="_idIndexMarker688"/>the rollout of new functions, features, and processes on a <span class="No-Break">regular cadence.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 9</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> illustrates the BASE’s conceptual model as a virtuous circle for enterprise improvements, with customers at its core. Customers and their buying journeys enable and fund <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>our business, establishing the requirements that guide our decision-making and business operations. The success of our business hinges on our ability to swiftly meet their needs or desires while managing <span class="No-Break">costs effectively.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2 – BASE’s virtuous circle for enterprise improvement</p>
			<p>As we work our way through this section, we will begin with a brief description of the outer ring of the BASE framework representing the four tenets of BASE followed by a more in-depth discussion of each tenet. Then, we will describe the eight BASE core processes (from Portfolio Management to Corporate Strategy) and conclude with the inner BASE core (Value Stream Management, Value Stream Improvement, Product Owner and Value Manager, and the <span class="No-Break">customer journey).</span></p>
			<p>But before we start our review of the tenets and processes defined within the BASE conceptual model, let’s first understand why we refer to this model as a Virtuous Circle for Continuous <span class="No-Break">Enterprise Improvements.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>Defining the virtuous circle for continuous improvement</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">virtuous circle for continuous enterprise improvements</strong> is a self-reinforcing loop <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>where each positive action leads to further enhancements and benefits. In this context, it means that improvements in one area of the business drive further improvements across the enterprise, creating a cycle of ongoing enhancement and <span class="No-Break">value creation.</span></p>
			<p>For example, an organization invests in analyzing the customer experience within its target market and in marketing to attract more customers who will value its products and services. As the customer base grows, product development budgets increase, allowing further investment in customer-centric product enhancements and related promotional and sales strategies, resulting in even higher revenue and growth. This cyclical process never stops across the life cycles of our products and services. In this example, note how we have kept the customer front and center to ensure we stay on track with our investments and work to meet <span class="No-Break">their needs.</span></p>
			<p>This never-ending loop results in benefits that increase the positive effect of the next item in the loop. Every core virtuous circle activity affects the ability of the value streams to deliver customer-centric value. Consequently, skipping any virtuous circle activity affects the organization’s ability to deliver value through value streams that create products and services. A BASE enterprise ensures that its strategy and governance apply a Lean and Agile mindset, principles, and practices to achieve business agility. It enables the enterprise to move quickly and safely and adapt to change. The BASE is also built on two <span class="No-Break">core principles.</span></p>
			<h3>Underlying core principles</h3>
			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>further exploring the virtuous circle, it is essential to grasp two core and integrated principles that inform the BASE model: <strong class="bold">first principles</strong> and <strong class="bold">systems thinking</strong>. They offer practical insights into decision-making and problem-solving within <span class="No-Break">an organization:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">First principles</strong>: These represent the fundamental mechanisms of the world, forming <a id="_idIndexMarker692"/>the foundation for logical reasoning and decision-making. They are discovered through careful observation and <span class="No-Break">rigorous evaluation.</span><p class="list-inset">In Lean-Agile practices, first principles involve focusing on delivering maximum value to the customer by eliminating waste and continuously improving processes. Ignoring first principles can lead to negative consequences, for example, inefficiencies and overlooked opportunities. Embodying a scientific mindset, first principles involve questioning assumptions, developing theories based on evidence, and testing hypotheses <span class="No-Break">for validation.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Systems thinking</strong>: This prompts us to consider the entire system when contemplating change, as issues often originate from the interactions and interfaces <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>among system components, rather than from individual actions. Therefore, focusing solely on individual components or issues within a system is <span class="No-Break">typically ineffective.</span><p class="list-inset">Cross-team challenges frequently arise from external factors, people, and processes within our business as a solution development environment. It’s crucial to foster collaboration among these elements to resolve such issues collaboratively rather than in isolation. Moreover, creating a psychologically safe space becomes more achievable when management prioritizes improving systems over attributing blame <span class="No-Break">to people.</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following first principles underpin the BASE conceptual model and guide <span class="No-Break">its implementation:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Satisfying the needs of customers and aligning them with the organization’s objectives</strong>: Success is attained by delivering value for both parties. BASE ensures initiatives delivered across the enterprise are prioritized to deliver value as defined by customers. Ignoring this core principle jeopardizes success. Additionally, each virtuous circle activity in the BASE integrates customer feedback to inform decision-making and drive <span class="No-Break">incremental improvements.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Distributing work among small, collaborative teams tasked with delivering customer-centric valuable increments</strong>: Multiple BLAST teams contribute to the BASE’s value-creation activities by harmonizing efforts to develop <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>MVPs and a series of MVIs. Information about BLAST was covered in the <span class="No-Break">previous chapter.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leveraging digital technologies extends to our processes, products, and services</strong>: Digital optimization offers unprecedented opportunities for enhancing operational efficiency, effectiveness, and competitiveness. By prioritizing digital optimization, organizations commit to exploring, adopting, and innovating digital solutions. This commitment elevates performance, delivers superior value to customers, and helps the enterprise maintain a sustainable <span class="No-Break">competitive edge.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>With this background in mind, let us take a high-level tour of the BASE virtuous circle and its significant processes. We will start with the four tenets of <span class="No-Break">the BASE.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>Understanding the four tenets of the BASE</h2>
			<p>The outer <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>ring of the BASE diagram in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 9</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> illustrates the four tenets that underpin an organization’s Lean-Agile environment. They include <strong class="bold">strategy<a id="_idTextAnchor434"/> and execution</strong>, <strong class="bold">Lean-Agile culture</strong>, <strong class="bold">hypothesis-driven development</strong>, and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">business agility</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Aligning execution with strategy ensures the organization remains focused on achieving its mission <span class="No-Break">and vision</span></li>
				<li>Establishing a Lean-Agile culture enables the organization to manage competing production and development objectives simultaneously while maintaining operational efficiencies, gaining higher throughput, and quality to adapt and evolve in dynamic <span class="No-Break">business situations</span></li>
				<li>Hypothesis-driven development using MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs establishes the cadence <a id="_idIndexMarker696"/>for producing new increments <span class="No-Break">of value</span></li>
				<li>Lastly, business agility in an enterprise refers to the organization’s capacity to adapt rapidly and effectively to changes in the <span class="No-Break">business environment</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s take a closer look at these <span class="No-Break">four tenets.</span></p>
			<h3>Aligning strategy and execution</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Strategy and execution alignment</strong> ensures organizational goals get translated into actionable <a id="_idIndexMarker697"/>plans, enabling efficient progress, and maintaining focus on the mission and vision. It is critical for success, to ensure employees’ daily activities and decisions align with strategic goals, creating a cohesive approach to achieving <span class="No-Break">business objectives.</span></p>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>alignment bridges the gap between strategic planning and implementation, requiring clear communication of the company’s vision, mission, and objectives at all levels. Proper alignment helps employees understand how their roles contribute to broader goals. However, many companies struggle with this, leading to wasted resources and conflicting priorities. Research indicates only a small percentage of senior executives and frontline supervisors can link initiatives to <span class="No-Break">corporate priorities.</span></p>
			<p>To achieve alignment, organizations should focus on clear communications so that strategy is understood at all organizational levels. Align jobs by implementing roles that support strategic objectives. Foster a culture where employees own their contributions to strategy. Regularly review and adjust strategy based on business results and market changes. Use <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>performance management systems <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>to track progress towards goals with systems such as <strong class="bold">objectives and key results</strong> (<strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>) and <strong class="bold">key performance </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">indicators</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">KPIs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>Focusing on these areas strengthens the link between strategic intent and daily operations, improving strategy execution and enhancing employee engagement. This ongoing process positions organizations to adapt to market changes, outperform competitors, and achieve <span class="No-Break">long-term objectives.</span></p>
			<h3>Cultivating a Lean-Agile culture</h3>
			<p>A Lean-Agile culture fosters a mindset of continuous improvement and adaptability, empowering <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>teams to rapidly respond to change and deliver high-quality value efficiently. It represents a transformative approach to organizational management, rooted in the principles of Lean thinking and Agile methodologies. Moreover, it prioritizes customer value delivery, waste minimization, and the cultivation of a collaborative, adaptive work environment. At its core, it empowers teams through decentralized decision-making, fostering innovation and <span class="No-Break">rapid experimentation.</span></p>
			<p>A Lean-Agile culture is characterized by a customer-centric focus, continuously aligning efforts with customer needs and preferences. It implements iterative improvement through continuous feedback loops for <span class="No-Break">incremental enhancements.</span></p>
			<p>Decentralized decision-making grants teams autonomy to drive innovation and quick problem-solving. Transparency and open communication build trust and alignment across the organization. Cross-functional collaboration breaks down silos to enhance information and <span class="No-Break">idea flow.</span></p>
			<p>The culture favors incremental change, preferring small, frequent updates over large, risky overhauls. Leaders in a Lean-Agile culture serve as facilitators and coaches, not traditional command-and-control managers. They support team empowerment and resource provisioning while championing continuous learning and improvement. This leadership style fosters an environment where adaptability and growth become integral to the <span class="No-Break">organizational DNA.</span></p>
			<p>A Lean-Agile culture enhances organizational resilience and responsiveness, improving the ability to navigate complex business landscapes. It enables faster time-to-market for products and services, increases competitive advantage through continuous innovation, and ensures consistent delivery of exceptional <span class="No-Break">customer value.</span></p>
			<p>By embracing a Lean-Agile culture, organizations position themselves to thrive in the face of rapid market changes, evolving customer expectations, and intense competition. This approach not only streamlines operations but also cultivates a workforce that is engaged, innovative, and aligned with the company’s strategic goals. In conclusion, a Lean-Agile culture represents a powerful paradigm shift in organizational thinking and practice. It equips companies with the tools and mindset necessary to excel in today’s dynamic business environment, ensuring sustained growth and <span class="No-Break">customer satisfaction.</span></p>
			<h3>Implementing hypothesis-driven development</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Hypothesis-driven development</strong> (<strong class="bold">HDD</strong>) is a powerful approach to product development <a id="_idIndexMarker702"/>that combines scientific methodology with Agile practices. At its core, it emphasizes the importance of formulating and testing hypotheses <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>about user needs, behaviors, and product features before committing significant resources to development. Hypothesis-driven development is a structured process where assumptions about product features or user needs are rigorously tested. It begins with identifying key assumptions and converting them into clear, measurable statements. Metrics are defined to measure success, and experiments such as prototypes or A/B tests are designed and executed to gather data. The outcomes of these experiments are analyzed to confirm or refute the initial assumptions. Based on the findings, decisions are made to either scale successful solutions or refine and retest. This iterative approach ensures continuous learning and data-driven decision-making in product development. This approach allows teams to make data-driven decisions, reduce risk, and create products that truly meet <span class="No-Break">user needs.</span></p>
			<p>In the context of HDD and the BASE, three key concepts play crucial roles in implementing this iterative and <span class="No-Break">experimental approach:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Minimum viable products (MVPs)</strong>: MVPs are the cornerstone of many lean startup <a id="_idIndexMarker704"/>methodologies and play a vital role in HDD. An MVP represents the smallest <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>version of a product that can effectively test core hypotheses about its value proposition. It contains just enough features to gather meaningful feedback from early adopters or potential customers. The primary goal of an MVP is to validate or invalidate key assumptions about the product’s market fit, user needs, and potential success with minimal investment of time and resources. By releasing an MVP, teams can quickly learn from real-world usage and adjust their product <span class="No-Break">strategy accordingly.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Minimum valuable increments (MVIs)</strong>: MVIs focus on delivering incremental <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>value to <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>users and support all business development requirements, spanning business processes, systems, artifacts, and enhancements to products and services. An MVI represents a small, discrete piece of functionality or improvement that provides tangible value to the user or <span class="No-Break">the business.</span><p class="list-inset">Unlike MVPs, which are typically used at the outset of product development, MVIs are employed throughout the product's development life cycle to continuously deliver value and gather feedback. MVIs allow teams to break down larger features <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>or improvements into smaller, manageable chunks that can be developed, tested, and potentially released <span class="No-Break">more quickly.</span></p><p class="list-inset">This <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>approach supports continuous integration and delivery practices, enabling teams to respond more rapidly to changing requirements or user feedback. Finally, MVIs can be released individually or as part of <span class="No-Break">an MVR.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Minimum viable releases (MVRs</strong><strong class="bold">)</strong>: MVRs extend the iterative approach to the <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>release level, enabling organizations to deliver tangible value while minimizing <a id="_idIndexMarker711"/>waste. An MVR represents the smallest set of features or improvements that can be packaged into a release while still providing meaningful value to users <span class="No-Break">or stakeholders.</span><p class="list-inset">MVRs allow teams to release more frequently, gathering feedback and validating hypotheses at regular intervals. This approach helps reduce the risk associated with large, infrequent releases and allows organizations to respond more quickly to market changes or <span class="No-Break">user needs.</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By incorporating these three concepts – MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs – into the hypothesis-driven <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>development process, teams can create a highly adaptive and efficient product development cycle. This approach allows for rapid hypothesis testing and validation through MVPs, continuous delivery of value through MVIs, and regular, meaningful releases <span class="No-Break">through MVRs.</span></p>
			<p>This combination supports a culture of experimentation, learning, and continuous improvement. It enables teams to make data-driven decisions, reduce the risk of building features or products that don’t meet user needs, and optimize resource allocation by focusing on validated high-value developments. Moreover, this approach fosters closer alignment between development efforts and business objectives. By consistently delivering value in small, measurable increments, teams can demonstrate progress more effectively to stakeholders and adjust course quickly when needed. This agility is <a id="_idIndexMarker713"/>particularly valuable in fast-moving markets or when dealing with emerging technologies where a user’s needs and market conditions can <span class="No-Break">change rapidly.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 9</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em> compares MVPs and MVI across eight areas as these concepts are sometimes confused by people who are new to <span class="No-Break">these terms.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.3 – Comparing MVPs and MVIs</p>
			<p>In summary, hypothesis-driven development, supported by MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs, provides a robust model for modern product development. It combines the rigor of scientific inquiry with the flexibility of Agile methodologies, enabling organizations to innovate more effectively, reduce risk, and consistently deliver value to their users <span class="No-Break">and stakeholders.</span></p>
			<h3>Enhancing business agility</h3>
			<p>In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, the ability to quickly respond to market shifts, customer demands, and competitive pressures is paramount. This capability, known as <a id="_idIndexMarker714"/>business agility, forms a critical tenet within the BASE and is essential for <span class="No-Break">organizational success.</span></p>
			<p>Put simply, we define business agility as an organization’s capacity to adapt and thrive amidst uncertainty and volatility. It emphasizes flexibility across all business aspects, resilience in the face of challenges, and adaptability in strategy, operations, and <span class="No-Break">customer engagement.</span></p>
			<p>To cultivate <a id="_idIndexMarker715"/>business agility, organizations should implement the following <span class="No-Break">key practices:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Employ <span class="No-Break">decentralized decision-making</span></li>
				<li>Leverage rapid experimentation <span class="No-Break">and learning</span></li>
				<li>Focus on making <span class="No-Break">customer-centric decisions</span></li>
				<li>Practice <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement</span></li>
				<li>Use value stream management <span class="No-Break">and mapping</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These practices enable organizations to anticipate and proactively address emerging challenges and opportunities, staying ahead of the curve in an ever-changing <span class="No-Break">business environment.</span></p>
			<p>Embracing business agility within the BASE also enables organizations to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Seize new <span class="No-Break">opportunities quickly</span></li>
				<li>Navigate uncertainty <span class="No-Break">with confidence</span></li>
				<li>Foster a culture of innovation <span class="No-Break">and adaptability</span></li>
				<li>Enhance strategic alignment and improve iterative <span class="No-Break">product development</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These benefits position organizations not just to survive but to thrive amidst modern business complexities and challenges. As a vital tenet of the BASE, business agility also empowers organizations to respond effectively to market changes, adapt strategies and operations in real time, engage customers more dynamically, and drive <span class="No-Break">continuous innovation.</span></p>
			<p>In conclusion, business agility, a cornerstone of the BASE, equips organizations with the tools and mindset necessary to navigate today’s evolving business environment with confidence <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>and resilience. By adopting Lean-Agile practices and fostering a culture of adaptability, organizations can position themselves for sustained success in an increasingly complex and <span class="No-Break">competitive world.</span></p>
			<p>This completes <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>our discussion on first principles, systems thinking, and the BASE’s four core tenets. We will now explore the eight processes within the BASE conceptual model for coordinating work across <span class="No-Break">the enterprise.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>Eight BASE business processes</h2>
			<p>The BASE model outlines eight main processes that define a product delivery strategy for the <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>enterprise to deliver new integrated increments of value in a predictable cadence. These processes can work for any type of organization, including commercial enterprises, non-profits, or government agencies. The BASE model doesn’t tell you exactly what kind of work your company needs to do to delivery products and services your external customers want. It also doesn’t give step-by-step instructions on how to use Lean-Agile methods to beat your competitors. That hard work belongs to you and your organizations to determine. However, the authors provide the following examples of common business processes and activities that your company might use to get ahead of others in <span class="No-Break">your field:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Portfolio management</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Planning increments</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Refining increments</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Integrated increments</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Integrated reviews</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Customer care</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Customer experience</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Corporate strategy</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you read through the sections that follow, please refer to Appendix 9.1 - Business Processes, Activities and Tasks. In that Appendix, you will find lists of common activities and tasks associated with each of the eight BASE <span class="No-Break">business processes.</span></p>
			<h3>Corporate strategy</h3>
			<p>In the BASE model, corporate strategy encompasses processes to define and communicate <a id="_idIndexMarker719"/>the organization’s vision, mission, goals, objectives, and priorities. Activities include assessing the products and services the organization can deliver, its target customers, and how the organization can uniquely and profitably <span class="No-Break">deliver value.</span></p>
			<p>C-Suite executives are responsible for developing and refining corporate strategy and governance policies. Chief executives establish governance policies to ensure organizational accountability, ethical conduct, and strategic alignment, fostering trust and sustainable success. Additionally, chief executives are accountable for aligning business unit activities with corporate goals and objectives and making critical business decisions. The establishment of OKRs is a key tool for <span class="No-Break">this alignment.</span></p>
			<p>Ideally, the <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>executives should communicate a new set of OKRs in cadence with each BASE increment. <strong class="bold">Objectives and Key Results</strong> (<strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>) is a goal-setting framework used by organizations to define and track objectives and their outcomes. OKRs work by setting clear, measurable goals (Objectives) and specifying key results (Key Results) that indicate progress toward achieving those goals. Objectives are ambitious and qualitative, while Key Results are specific, quantitative, and time-bound, providing a clear metric <span class="No-Break">for success.</span></p>
			<p>The typical recommendation for OKRs is to set 3-5 Objectives per organizational level (e.g., company, division, department), each with 3-5 Key Results. This keeps the focus manageable and ensures that each Objective receives adequate attention. OKRs are usually set and reviewed quarterly, allowing for regular assessment and adjustment while maintaining alignment with longer-term <span class="No-Break">annual goals.</span></p>
			<p>In BASE, the OKR framework encourages alignment, focus, and engagement across the organization, ensuring that all value stream and functional team members work towards common, strategic objectives and can track their <span class="No-Break">progress regularly.</span></p>
			<h3>Portfolio management</h3>
			<p>A Lean-Agile <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>portfolio invests in six fundamental <strong class="bold">business enablers</strong>: <em class="italic">people</em>, <em class="italic">processes</em>, <em class="italic">information</em>, <em class="italic">technology</em>, <em class="italic">products</em>, and <em class="italic">infrastructure</em>. In BASE, the portfolio management function oversees these investments and other significant initiatives to achieve the organization’s strategic objectives and maximize portfolio value. Chief and Line of Business (LoB) executives determine the funding level for each portfolio and agree on spending for investment themes developed through collaboration between senior portfolio leaders and enterprise executives. These investment themes guide how each portfolio invests in its value streams and contributes to the overall <span class="No-Break">enterprise strategy.</span></p>
			<p>Senior portfolio <a id="_idIndexMarker722"/>leaders use investment themes to decide funding for development value streams, prioritize strategic initiatives, allocate resources, and monitor portfolio performance. Collaborating with product management and other business owners, the portfolio identifies significant initiatives to advance from the portfolio’s current state to the future state aligned with <span class="No-Break">investment themes.</span></p>
			<p>Business strategy, OKRs, KPIs, and feedback from MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs all serve as tools for data-driven decision-making in portfolio management. Agile teams provide feedback through quantitative   metrics and qualitative information enabling collaborative decision-making at both top-down and <span class="No-Break">bottom-up levels.</span></p>
			<p>Portfolio Management within the BASE model encompasses a range of activities aimed at strategically allocating resources, prioritizing initiatives, and maximizing the value delivered by investments across the organization. Key activities include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Strategic investment prioritization, resource allocation, <span class="No-Break">and budgeting</span></li>
				<li>Developing Investment themes in alignment with enterprise strategy and monitoring and managing <span class="No-Break">portfolio performance</span></li>
				<li>Identifying and prioritizing strategic initiatives in collaboration with product management and business owners for <span class="No-Break">initiative selection</span></li>
				<li>Communicating portfolio strategy, objectives and key results (OKRs, and working with local teams to align their value stream’s key performance <span class="No-Break">indicators (KPIs)</span></li>
				<li>Facilitating top-down and bottom-up collaboration for decision-making, including Integrating feedback from teams using BLAST to support MVPs, MVIs, <span class="No-Break">and MVRs</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With Portfolio management considerations accounted for, the next step in our virtuous circle is to plan new increments of value to support the evolution of <span class="No-Break">the portfolio.</span></p>
			<h3>Planning increments</h3>
			<p>This phase entails the meticulous planning and prioritization of work across various domains, including <a id="_idIndexMarker723"/>portfolio management, product and marketing management, production, sales, distribution, services, and partner management. The value manager facilitates this process, gathering inputs from customers, stakeholders, domain experts, executives, and team members to assess <span class="No-Break">priorities collaboratively.</span></p>
			<p>While consensus is ideal, it’s not always feasible. In such cases, the value manager makes informed decisions based on available information. The BASE model mitigates risks by establishing a consistent cadence, reducing uncertainty with <span class="No-Break">each increment.</span></p>
			<p>Delivering value through integrated increments is paramount in Lean-Agile enterprises, facilitated by coordinating activities through the BLAST framework and BASE conceptual model. Specifically, multiple teams across the enterprise collaborate to assemble essential components, creating integrated increments in the form of MVPs, MVIs, or MVRs to deliver successful <span class="No-Break">value-based releases.</span></p>
			<p>Whether improving value streams, business processes, systems, artifacts, or products and services, a business value backlog is essential in BLAST and the BASE. This backlog spans multiple functions and value streams, requiring input from customers, stakeholders, experts, and executives <span class="No-Break">for prioritization.</span></p>
			<p>An optimal BLAST team size ranges from three to nine individuals, ensuring effective collaboration in addressing dependencies and synchronization issues across teams. Similar considerations apply to the number of participating teams in a BLAST, which should be limited to three to nine teams to facilitate efficient cross-team communication and synchronization management among the sub-team of BLAST representatives. The specific goal of each BLAST is tailored to address specific business needs and the complexity of integrated <span class="No-Break">increments required.</span></p>
			<p>Each BLAST has an assigned value manager responsible for managing its Business Value Backlog and work item prioritization. In multi-BLAST scenarios, a lead value manager oversees cross-BLAST priorities, coordinating efforts with product or portfolio management to produce the desired <span class="No-Break">integrated increments.</span></p>
			<p>The BASE model initiates new planning increments with each cycle, with value managers orchestrating pre-cycle planning sessions. BLAST teams define tasks and activities, and resolve  inter-team dependencies. Throughout each BASE cycle, traditional Lean and Agile metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>are monitored to track progress, maintain visibility and ensure timely issue resolution. Simultaneously, the lead value manager collaborates with product managers, marketing managers, and portfol<a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>io managers to plan <span class="No-Break">upcoming increments.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break">Refining increments</span></p>
			<p>The refinement of integrated increments is a continuous activity that occurs in lockstep with the <a id="_idIndexMarker725"/>planning increments process. Depending on the required granularity, an integrated increment can include MVPs, one or more MVIs, product features and functions, as well as user and technical stories. Production of an integrated increment may be supported by multiple value streams and various <span class="No-Break">business domains.</span></p>
			<p>Value managers lead the refinement process and work with the BLAST teams and their representatives to better understand and document requirements and acceptance criteria. We recommend the BLAST teams use traditional Agile-based user and technical stories and acceptance criteria formats for documenting <span class="No-Break">the requirements.</span></p>
			<p>With that recommendation made, let's take a quick look at the traditional Agile-based formats for defining epics, user stories, technical stories, and <span class="No-Break">acceptance criteria.</span></p>
			<p>Classically, organizations start defining requirements at a very high level in the form of an Epic. Though normally associated with Agile-based software development, the concept of Epics is easily applied to other requirements assessments, such as process, product, and <span class="No-Break">service improvements.</span></p>
			<p>In Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, the typical decomposition and relationship between epics, features, functions, stories, and acceptance criteria are structured <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Epics</strong>: These are large-scale initiatives or requirements that define broad business goals or customer needs at the outset. Epics are often called large stories, but there is no attempt to format the information beyond organizing it to maintain a logical train <span class="No-Break">of thought.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Features and functions</strong>: These represent distinct components or user capabilities derived from epics, focusing on specific customer-facing functionalities (features) or internal <span class="No-Break">operations (functions).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User stories</strong>: User stories break down features or functions into smaller, actionable units of work from an end-user perspective, detailing specific tasks that deliver business value. The traditional format is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span><p class="list-inset"><strong class="bold">As a [</strong><em class="italic">type of user</em><strong class="bold">], I want to [</strong><em class="italic">take action/ achieve a goal or obtain objective</em><strong class="bold">] so that [</strong><em class="italic">value-based benefit </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">or outcome</em></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">].</strong></span></p><p class="list-inset">Let’s break <span class="No-Break">this down:</span></p><ul><li><strong class="bold">As a [type of user]:</strong> This part identifies who the user is. It could be a customer, an admin, a visitor, or any other <span class="No-Break">relevant role.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">I want to [take action/achieve a goal or obtain objective]</strong>: Here, we express what the user wants to do. It could be a specific action they need to take or a goal they want <span class="No-Break">to achieve.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">So that [value-based benefit or outcome]</strong>: Finally, we explain the purpose behind fulfilling this user need. What benefit or outcome will the user gain from <span class="No-Break">this action?</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technical stories</strong>: Technical stories are similar to user stories but focus on technical <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>tasks or activities that are necessary to support the implementation of features or functions. They are written from a technical perspective and outline specific actions or improvements that need to be made within the system or infrastructure. The traditional format is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span><p class="list-inset"><strong class="bold">As a [</strong><em class="italic">role/persona/user type</em><strong class="bold">], I want to [</strong><em class="italic">goal or action</em><strong class="bold">] so that [</strong><em class="italic">desired result </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">from goal/action</em></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">].</strong></span></p><p class="list-inset">Let’s break <span class="No-Break">this down:</span></p><ul><li><strong class="bold">As a [role/persona/user type]</strong>: Just like in regular user stories, we start by identifying who the user is. However, in technical stories, this user might be a developer, system administrator<a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>, or any other <span class="No-Break">technical stakeholder.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">I want [goal or action]</strong>: Next, we express what the technical user wants to achieve. This could be related to coding, configuration, infrastructure, deployment, or any other <span class="No-Break">technical task.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">So that [desired result from goal/action]</strong>: Finally, we explain the purpose behind fulfilling this technical need. What benefit or outcome will be achieved by completing this <span class="No-Break">technical task?</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Acceptance criteria</strong>: These are specific conditions that user stories must meet to <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>be considered complete and ready for acceptance by stakeholders, ensuring they fulfill functional and non-functional requirements. The traditional format is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span><p class="list-inset"><strong class="bold">Given: [context or precondition], When: [action or event], Then: [outcome </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">or result]</strong></span></p><p class="list-inset">Let’s break <span class="No-Break">this down:</span></p><ul><li><strong class="bold">Given</strong>: <em class="italic">This</em> <em class="italic">sets the context (e.g., being on the product details page with </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">selected items)</em></span></li><li><strong class="bold">When</strong>: <em class="italic">This</em> <em class="italic">describes the action (e.g., clicking the “</em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Checkout” button).</em></span></li><li><strong class="bold">Then</strong>: <em class="italic">This</em> <em class="italic">outlines the expected outcome (e.g., seeing the </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">order summary)</em></span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Fail to define acceptance criteria at your own risk. Two things are guaranteed to happen. First, you will not know the full scope of usage criteria that will impact the successful implementation of the work item. Second, your customers may find fault for not delivering a complete or working solution. Yes, in Agile, we can always put the new criteria into our business value backlog. But, from an efficiency perspective, why not try to catch these requirements in advance? Now that we know how to refine our requirements, let’s look at how they progress from epics to <span class="No-Break">acceptance criteria.</span></p>
			<h4>Progressing epics</h4>
			<p>The typical <a id="_idIndexMarker728"/>progression in defining and refining requirements moves from broader epics to more detailed features/ functions, stories, and acceptance criteria, <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Epics are initially identified to outline major business objectives or customer <span class="No-Break">needs comprehensively.</span></li>
				<li>Features and functions are derived from epics, breaking down the broader scope into manageable components aligned with specific business goals or <span class="No-Break">technical requirements.</span></li>
				<li>User stories and technical stories are then created based on features or functions respectively, detailing the exact scenarios or tasks users need to perform to achieve <span class="No-Break">desired functionality.</span></li>
				<li>Acceptance <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>criteria are developed concurrently with or after defining user stories, specifying measurable conditions that ensure each user story meets stakeholder expectations and <span class="No-Break">functional requirements.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>With this progression in mind, we can now move on to understand techniques for prioritizing the work items in our <span class="No-Break">value-based backlogs.</span></p>
			<h4>Prioritizing business value backlogs</h4>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker730"/>subsection, we will briefly introduce two common strategies for prioritiz<a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>ing the work items in your business <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>value backlogs: <strong class="bold">Weighted Shortest Job First </strong>(<strong class="bold">WSJF</strong>) and <strong class="bold">MoSCoW</strong>. The WSJF approach prioritizes backlog items based <a id="_idIndexMarker732"/>on economic value and urgency, emphasizing maximizing returns and minimizing the cost of delay. In contrast, the MoSCoW method categorizes requirements into must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and won’t-haves, focusing on essential features and prioritization based on critical needs and <span class="No-Break">project constraints.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll start <span class="No-Break">with WSJF.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Weighted shortest job first (</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">WSJF) prioritization</strong></span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, we explored how Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) serves as a powerful prioritization <a id="_idIndexMarker733"/>tool in Agile and Lean environments. By calculating a score based on <strong class="bold">Cost of Delay </strong>(<strong class="bold">CoD</strong>) and job duration, WSJF helps teams determine which backlog items to tackle first for maximum economic benefit. This method ensures that high-value tasks, which deliver results quickly and incur significant costs if delayed, are given precedence. WSJF aligns with Lean principles by focusing on maximizing value, disregarding sunk costs, and continuously optimizing economic decisions. It’s a vital compass for organizations seeking efficient backlog management and <span class="No-Break">prioritization strategies.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">MoSCoW prioritization</strong></span></p>
			<p>The MoSCoW method <a id="_idIndexMarker734"/>is a prioritization technique widely used in Agile and Scrum methodologies to manage backlog items based on their importance and urgency. The acronym MoSCoW stands for <em class="italic">Must have</em>, <em class="italic">Should have</em>, <em class="italic">Could have</em>, and <em class="italic">Won’t have (this time)</em>. This method categorizes backlog items into the four MoSCoW categories to guide teams in determining what needs to be delivered immediately versus what can <span class="No-Break">be deferred:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Must have</strong>: Essential requirements that must be delivered in the current iteration to meet project objectives or satisfy <span class="No-Break">key stakeholders.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Should have</strong>: Important requirements that are not critical for the current iteration but should be included if possible, to enhance the value of <span class="No-Break">the product.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Could have</strong>: Desirable requirements that would be nice to have but are not necessary for the current delivery. These items can be considered if time and <span class="No-Break">resources allow.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Won’t have</strong>: Items that are explicitly excluded from the current scope at this time. If desirable, but not a priority, they may be  deferred to future releases <span class="No-Break">or projects.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By using the MoSCoW method, Agile teams can prioritize backlog items collaboratively, ensuring alignment between business priorities and development efforts. This approach helps maximize the delivery of essential features early while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changing requirements throughout the project <span class="No-Break">life cycle.</span></p>
			<h3>Integrated increments</h3>
			<p>We’ve explained previously that the concept of integrated increments helps us define the work <a id="_idIndexMarker735"/>that individual teams and BLAST teams must deliver, and that they take three forms: MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs. This BASE process is where we build, test, and deliver the <span class="No-Break">integrated increments.</span></p>
			<p>This is not a singular process description. For example, the marketing team delivers components of an integrated increment to promote a new product or service which is a much different set of deliverables than those created by a software development team when they build an enhancement to a software application released in the same increment. However, both of these development and operational activities need to be coordinated to support a new MVR. Additionally, there can be other MVIs going through similar integrated increment build cycles in parallel to fulfill all the requirements of <span class="No-Break">the MVR.</span></p>
			<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker736"/>process automation and integration capabilities available today – recall our CI/CD and DevOps toolchain discussions – many development activities will operate using Lean’s flow principles. However, the iterative and incremental release cycle of Agile sets the cadence for increment planning, construction, reviews, <span class="No-Break">and deliveries.</span></p>
			<p>Before we leave this section, let’s look at common business processes, activities, and tasks that may contribute to the deliverables produced in a single <span class="No-Break">BASE Cycle.</span></p>
			<h4>Forming BLAST teams to deliver integrated increments</h4>
			<p>Recalling <a id="_idIndexMarker737"/>our discussions on how the BASE model establishes a virtuous circle for continuous business improvements, every part of an organization contributes during any given BASE cycle, as depicted in <em class="italic">Appendix 9.1</em>, <em class="italic">Table 9.1: Business Processes, Activities, </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">and Tasks</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In the BASE conceptual model, organizations harness BLAST Teams to effectively execute diverse processes critical to their operations and value streams. Executives may establish multiple BLASTs tailored to support various business processes across different business functions and value streams. For instance, within Corporate Strategy and Portfolio Management, dedicated BLASTs may focus on vision development, strategic planning, performance management, and risk mitigation aligned with specific value streams. Similarly, Product and Marketing Management functions can form BLASTs to manage market intelligence, strategic decision-making, product development, market introduction, and sales support activities that drive value creation across their respective <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>The primary objective of these BLAST Teams within the BASE model is to deliver integrated increments of value, presented as MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs, within a single BASE cycle (i.e., one loop of its Virtuous Circle). Some MVIs may be released independently, while others contribute to larger MVRs. The flexibility of the BASE model allows organizations to adjust the number of integrated increments released per cycle based on their size and complexity. Larger organizations typically require multiple BLAST Teams to effectively manage and synchronize these processes, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with <span class="No-Break">customer-centric goals.</span></p>
			<p>Ultimately, your organization must define the business processes, activities, and tasks necessary to support delivering a new increment of value. It will determine the optimal setup <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>of BLAST teams to support these deliveries in the form of integrated increments. Finally, your organization will decide how and when to release each component of value during each BASE Cycle through its MVPs, MVIs, <span class="No-Break">and MVRs.</span></p>
			<p>As each integrated increment is constructed, it undergoes review for quality and completeness. These activities are detailed in the next core process, <span class="No-Break">Integrated Reviews.</span></p>
			<h3>Integrated reviews</h3>
			<p>Integrated increments from various BLAST teams require synchronization to support a new release. This <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>core BASE process stages the sequencing of integrated increments before their release—for example, coordinating marketing promotions and sales training ahead of product sales <span class="No-Break">and distribution.</span></p>
			<p>SMEs, customers, and stakeholders must review these increments at this stage. They assess whether the integrated increment’s goals, user stories, technical requirements, and acceptance criteria have <span class="No-Break">been met.</span></p>
			<p>Any issues identified are processed through the <em class="italic">feedback and pivot</em> branch of the BLAST Framework. Defects or errors are returned to the <em class="italic">business value backlog</em> for refinement and prioritization. If urgent and feasible within the current BASE cycle, they are promptly addressed; otherwise, they are scheduled for a future <span class="No-Break">BASE cycle.</span></p>
			<p>At this stage, integrated increments that have been successfully reviewed and deemed ready for release are deployed in proper synchronization with other integrated increments or on demand as needed. Once accepted, the deployed products and services for both internal and external customers must be supported, a topic covered in the next section on <span class="No-Break">customer care.</span></p>
			<h3>Customer care</h3>
			<p>Effective <strong class="bold">customer care</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>critical process group within the BASE Model, ensuring that businesses can consistently meet customer needs and expectations across diverse product types and industries. Implementing an exemplary customer support program involves several <span class="No-Break">key practices:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer-Centric Approach:</strong> Make it a priority to understand and anticipate customer needs and to provide proactive support and <span class="No-Break">personalized experiences.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Multi-Channel Support:</strong> Offer support across various channels (e.g., phone, email, chat, social media) to accommodate diverse customer preferences and <span class="No-Break">ensure accessibility.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Timely and Responsive Service:</strong> Implement quick response times and resolution to customer inquiries and issues, aiming for high customer satisfaction <span class="No-Break">and retention.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Knowledge Management:</strong> Maintain a centralized knowledge base to empower <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>support agents with accurate information and solutions, ensuring consistency in <span class="No-Break">service delivery.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous Improvement:</strong> Regularly gather customer feedback to identify areas for improvement, iterate on support processes, and enhance overall <span class="No-Break">service quality.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Training and Development:</strong> Invest in training programs to equip support teams with the skills and knowledge needed to handle customer interactions effectively <span class="No-Break">and empathetically.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration with Product Development:</strong> Foster collaboration between customer support and product development teams to address recurring issues, prioritize feature requests, and enhance <span class="No-Break">product usability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Metrics and Analytics</strong>: Utilize metrics such as customer satisfaction scores, response times, and resolution rates to measure performance and drive continuous <span class="No-Break">service improvements.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>By incorporating these practices into the BASE Model’s Customer Care process, businesses can build strong customer relationships, improve retention rates, and differentiate themselves in competitive markets. Additionally, each product or service release affects the ability to deliver effective customer care processes, necessitating ongoing investments and process improvements to maintain effective customer support capabilities. Next up in our BASE process group is measuring customer experience (CX) and acting on <span class="No-Break">our findings.</span></p>
			<h3>Customer experience</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Customer experience (CX)</strong> embodies <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>the philosophy of prioritizing and enhancing the satisfaction, delight, and loyalty of customers <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>throughout their interactions with a business or brand. This emphasizes flexibility, rapid iteration, and customer feedback to optimize the consumer experience across all touchpoints. By adopting Lean-Agile principles, organizations aim to respond more to customer needs and market changes, enhancing customer satisfaction <span class="No-Break">and loyalty.</span></p>
			<p>Lean-Agile CX in the BASE model requires breaking down large, complex customer experience initiatives into smaller chunks that can fit within a BASE Iteration. During these BASE cadences, cross-functional teams work collaboratively to evaluate changes in the customer experience. These changes could be anything from refining the user interface on a website to streamlining the customer service process. After each iteration, the team reviews the outcomes and gathers feedback from stakeholders, including real customers, to inform the next cycle of product or service improvements. This iterative cycle helps ensure the organization continuously adapts and evolves its strategies to meet customer <span class="No-Break">expectations effectively.</span></p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>five key CX activities are common in <span class="No-Break">many organizations:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Conducting <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>customer journey mapping to understand and improve the end-to-end <span class="No-Break">customer experience.</span></li>
				<li>Implementing <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>)/ <strong class="bold">user experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>) design principles to enhance the interactions, usability and accessibility of products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></li>
				<li>Optimizing customer service processes and channels to provide timely and <span class="No-Break">effective support.</span></li>
				<li>Personalizing marketing and communication strategies to better resonate with individual customer needs <span class="No-Break">and preferences.</span></li>
				<li>Monitoring and analyzing key metrics related to customer satisfaction, loyalty, <span class="No-Break">and retention.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some organizations may add these additional activities to enhance their customer <span class="No-Break">experience initiatives:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Continuously iterate and improve CX initiatives based on insights gained from data analysis and <span class="No-Break">customer feedback</span></li>
				<li>Collaborate cross-functionally to align CX efforts with organizational goals <span class="No-Break">and strategies</span></li>
				<li>Implement <a id="_idIndexMarker746"/>technology solutions such as <strong class="bold">customer relationship management</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRM</strong>) systems and data analytics tools to enhance <span class="No-Break">CX capabilities</span></li>
				<li>Train and empower employees to deliver exceptional customer experiences at <span class="No-Break">every touchpoint</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>activities are essential for organizations aiming to create positive and memorable experiences for their customers <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>across various interactions and touchpoints. Moreover, Lean-Agile CX fosters a culture of ongoing learning and adaptability. By constantly testing new ideas and gathering feedback through MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs, companies can quickly learn what works and what doesn’t, greatly reducing risk. This approach helps refine product offerings and enhances overall service delivery, making companies more competitive and <span class="No-Break">customer centric.</span></p>
			<p>This completes our discussions on the eight core BASE business processes. Now, we are going to move to the core of the BASE conceptual model, which is all about putting our <span class="No-Break">customers first.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>Establishing customer-centric foundations</h1>
			<p>Both Lean <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>and Agile practitioners have stressed the importance of delivering customer-centric value. Therefore, a Lean-Agile conceptual model such as the BASE must similarly place the customer at the center of everything <span class="No-Break">we do.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 9</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em>, the core of the BASE, provides a graphical perspective of these concepts. The BASE intentionally puts improvements to the customer journey at the center of our enterprise improvement activities. We also show the criticality of having Value Managers and Product Owners orchestrating <span class="No-Break">those efforts.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer110">
					<img alt="Figure 9.4 – The core of the BASE conceptual model" src="image/B21818_09_4.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.4 – The core of the BASE conceptual model</p>
			<p>To further <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>emphasize the importance of coordinating work to support customers’ views on value, the <em class="italic">Value Manager</em> represents the customer’s voice in BASE, signifying their role in overseeing improvements across value streams and products and fostering effective <span class="No-Break">team communication.</span></p>
			<p>While the <em class="italic">Product Owner</em> role remains a viable option to apply in BASE, we caution against splitting functions between the two roles due to potential conflicts of interest, such as those between value stream improvements and product enhancements. However, if you opt for the title Product Owner, ensure that the individual in this role oversees all aspects of <span class="No-Break">value creation.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Value Stream Management</em> activities are central to the BASE model. In any organization, it’s common to face an abundance of tasks and conflicting priorities, which can overwhelm resources and lead to ineffective management. Without a holistic view or prioritization system, this often results in firefighting, conflicts, and <span class="No-Break">unmet expectations.</span></p>
			<p>VSM methods and tools play a crucial role in this context by enabling rigorous evaluation of the most impactful changes to enhance productivity and efficiency across the organization. By taking a systemic view of product delivery activities, VSM ensures that <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>resources are allocated optimally and that each iteration of the BASE cycle benefits from enhanced efficiency, productivity, <span class="No-Break">and adaptability.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s move on to the last section of this chapter, where we discuss the importance of taking a life cycle view to <span class="No-Break">product development.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>Delivering value across the product life cycle</h1>
			<p>The BASE model embodies the essence of guiding organizations through the complexities <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>of modern business landscapes by emphasizing value delivery across product life cycles. As we delve into practical applications of foundational theories, we explore the intricate processes that form the virtuous circle of BASE. This exploration provides a holistic view of how organizations systematically create, deliver, and enhance value throughout a product's <span class="No-Break">entire lifespan.</span></p>
			<p>At its core, the BASE model is designed to foster a culture of innovation, customer-centricity, and continuous improvement. It offers organizations a structured approach to aligning operations and customer engagement with business strategies, maximizing value creation, and sustaining competitive advantage. BASE stands out for its commitment to leveraging common sense and well-understood business practices avoiding the creation of unnecessary roles or imposition of counterintuitive business activities. While Lean and Agile practices may still be emerging or not fully mature in many organizations, their underlying concepts are proven <span class="No-Break">and robust.</span></p>
			<p>This section dissects the interplay between strategic decision-making, customer insights, and operational excellence. Understanding these elements’ convergence enables organizations to develop robust, customer-oriented strategies that drive value creation across every stage of the product <span class="No-Break">life cycle.</span></p>
			<p>From ideation through delivery and beyond, each phase of the product life cycle presents distinct challenges and opportunities. The BASE model equips organizations with principles and practices to navigate these complexities with agility and precision. Readers will gain actionable insights and practical strategies to optimize value creation across product life cycles, positioning themselves for long-term success in today’s dynamic <span class="No-Break">business landscape.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor441"/>Leveraging customer centricity for strategic growth</h2>
			<p>At the <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>heart of the BASE’s customer-centric approach lies the recognition that customer satisfaction and loyalty are pivotal to organizational success. While, theoretically, any core process can serve as an entry point into the BASE model, for this discussion, we begin with Customer Care, which serves as the gateway to successful customer engagements in the BASE model. This function acts as the frontline of interaction between the organization and <span class="No-Break">its customers.</span></p>
			<h3>Enhancing customer engagement in the BASE</h3>
			<p>In a Lean-Agile organization, the commitment to customer centricity is not just a philosophy <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>but a guiding principle that informs every facet of operations. Customer Care, as the front line of customer interaction, extends far beyond mere post-purchase services. It involves a comprehensive suite of activities to ensure ongoing customer satisfaction and loyalty. These activities include providing timely support and assistance, actively soliciting feedback, addressing customer concerns, and identifying opportunities for product or service improvement. Organizations can cultivate strong relationships and foster long-term loyalty by maintaining open lines of communication and demonstrating a genuine commitment to meeting <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<h3>Supporting customer engagements in the BASE</h3>
			<p>Running through the cycle, customer care encompasses a spectrum of activities, including <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>delivery, support, maintenance, and repair, all aimed at surpassing customer expectations. By actively engaging with customers post-purchase, organizations gain valuable feedback, identify pain points, and stay informed about emerging trends and <span class="No-Break">customer aspirations.</span></p>
			<p>Building upon the foundation of customer care is the customer experience process, which extends beyond basic service provision to proactively engage with customers and understand their holistic experience with the organization’s products and services. This involves various initiatives such as outreach programs, reward schemes, and conversational AI technologies designed to capture insights into customer preferences, satisfaction levels, and areas for improvement. Additionally, activities such as customer journey mapping provide a structured approach to understanding the end-to-end customer experience, enabling organizations to identify moments of delight, frustration, and opportunities <span class="No-Break">for optimization.</span></p>
			<p>Corporate strategy integrates insights from customer care and customer experience to shape the organization’s future direction. This strategic process involves critical decisions about product extensions, service enhancements, and market expansion initiatives. By aligning corporate strategy with customer needs and preferences, organizations can ensure that their investments and initiatives are strategically aligned to maximize customer value and drive sustainable growth with each <span class="No-Break">delivery cycle.</span></p>
			<p>Beyond CX, customer care, and strategy, the remaining  core processes in the BASE model focus on building and delivering integrated increments. The scope of work is dependent upon a myriad of business factors that must be addressed. As the improvement opportunities are identified, the value  managers collaborate with BLAST teams, stakeholders, SMEs, and functional area leads to prioritize <span class="No-Break">current initiatives.</span></p>
			<p>Leveraging customer centricity for strategic growth within the BASE necessitates a deep understanding of customer needs, preferences, and behaviors. By prioritizing customer insights and integrating them into strategic decision-making processes, organizations can build competitive advantages, foster customer loyalty, and achieve long-term success in today’s dynamic <span class="No-Break">business landscape.</span></p>
			<p>In the next subsection, we delve into the operational aspects of customer engagement within the BASE model. From post-purchase interactions to proactive outreach initiatives, we explore how organizations cultivate meaningful connections with <span class="No-Break">their customers.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor442"/>Continuously improving value delivery</h2>
			<p>Value streams play a pivotal role in the BASE, serving as the fundamental path through which <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>value is conceptualized, created, and <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>delivered to customers. These streams encompass interconnected activities and processes spanning the entire product development life cycle, from ideation to delivery <span class="No-Break">and support.</span></p>
			<h3>Maintaining a product focus</h3>
			<p>In larger <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>organizations, operational, development, and support value streams can expand into the hundreds, if not thousands, each with its own set of activities. However, under the BASE model, our goal is simplification. Therefore, we concentrate each BASE cycle on enhancing a product-oriented value stream that delivers a specific type of product or service to our <span class="No-Break">external customers.</span></p>
			<p>In essence, don’t lose sight of the big picture. Maintain focus on a product or service that requires improvements. During initial planning, keep your BASE processes defined at a high level, allowing your BLAST teams to delve into the details of how to enhance value delivery. If your organization encompasses multiple product lines—distinguished not <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>merely by variations in make or model but by genuinely different products or services—each should undergo a dedicated BASE cycle to drive improvements in processes, products, and <span class="No-Break">related services.</span></p>
			<p>Indeed, larger organizations may run multiple BASE cycles concurrently by product line. This strategy simplifies and maintains focus on individual product line requirements. Otherwise, consider the challenges involved in making business process, system, product, and service improvements across multiple products—that’s far <span class="No-Break">from simple.</span></p>
			<p>By managing and optimizing these product-oriented value streams, organizations can streamline operations, accelerate time-to-market, and gain a competitive edge in today’s fast-paced <span class="No-Break">business environment.</span></p>
			<h3>Eliminating waste in order of customer impact</h3>
			<p>One crucial aspect of optimizing value streams is identifying and eliminating waste wherever <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>possible. This process includes conducting thorough value stream mapping exercises to pinpoint inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas of redundancy within <span class="No-Break">the workflow.</span></p>
			<p>At times, quality or cost issues may drive decisions on improvement priorities. But often, your constraints will lead you to your most impactful improvement opportunities. Recall our discussions on local optimization. Addressing a waste that is not hindering throughput may have little or no impact when it’s not constraining your value <span class="No-Break">stream flows.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 9</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em> provides a useful analogy: imagine the owners of this high-performance green Lamborghini. They’ve invested significantly in this fast car, yet their speed is limited by the traffic around them. Any attempt to push beyond that limit risks undesirable consequences. Put another way, their money is wasted until the bottlenecks and delays constraining it <span class="No-Break">are eliminated.</span></p>

			<p>Organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>can reduce cycle times, improve productivity, and enhance overall operational efficiency by streamlining processes, reducing unnecessary handoffs, and minimizing wait times. This allows organizations to deliver value to customers more quickly, reduces costs, and maximizes <span class="No-Break">resource utilization.</span></p>
			<h3>Using metrics to guide decision-making</h3>
			<p>Effective value stream management involves continuously monitoring and measuring key <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>performance metrics to track progress and identify areas for improvement. By establishing clear performance benchmarks and metrics, organizations can evaluate the effectiveness of their value streams and make data-driven decisions to optimize performance and enhance value delivery. This iterative approach to value stream management enables organizations to adapt and evolve in response to changing market dynamics, customer needs, and business requirements, ensuring that they remain agile and responsive in a rapidly evolving <span class="No-Break">business landscape.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, optimizing value streams requires a collaborative and cross-functional approach involving stakeholders across the organization. By breaking down silos and fostering collaboration between different departments and teams, organizations can streamline communication, improve coordination, and enhance alignment toward common goals. This collaborative approach accelerates value delivery and fosters a culture of continuous improvement and innovation, where employees are empowered to identify and implement process improvements to drive <span class="No-Break">organizational success.</span></p>
			<p>Optimizing value streams is essential for organizations seeking to drive sustainable growth <a id="_idIndexMarker763"/>and competitive advantage in today’s dynamic business environment. By streamlining operations, reducing waste, and fostering collaboration, organizations can enhance their ability to deliver value to customers efficiently and effectively, positioning themselves for long-term success and resilience in <span class="No-Break">the marketplace.</span></p>
			<p>Next up, we delve into our concluding subsection on implementing continuous improvements. There, we will focus on the pivotal role of Value Managers, the adoption of the BLAST framework, and the importance of continuous feedback loops in fostering innovation within <span class="No-Break">the BASE.</span></p>
			<h3>Implementing continuous improvement</h3>
			<p>In the BASE model, driving continuous improvement is a fundamental principle that underpins the <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>organization’s ability to adapt, innovate, and thrive in a rapidly changing business landscape. At its core are Value Managers, pivotal in orchestrating work to ensure that value delivery aligns with organizational goals and <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<p>Value Managers oversee value stream activities, facilitate cross-functional collaboration, and optimize processes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. They collaborate closely with value stream teams to define objectives, establish performance metrics, and identify improvement opportunities. By providing guidance, support, and resources, Value Managers empower teams to deliver high-quality MVPs and MVIs that meet customer expectations and drive <span class="No-Break">business outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>Lean-Agile teams within the organization leverage the BLAST framework to efficiently deliver new integrated increments. This framework incorporates Lean’s flow-oriented processes and Agile’s iterative and incremental development model, enabling teams to streamline workflows, accelerate value delivery, and maintain focus on improving <span class="No-Break">customer value.</span></p>
			<p>Continuous feedback and iterative learning are also critical within BASE. Lean-Agile teams regularly solicit feedback from customers, stakeholders, and end users to gather insights, identify improvement opportunities, and validate assumptions. This feedback loop enables teams to iterate on products and processes, refine strategies, and deliver value more effectively <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<p>By embracing a culture of experimentation, innovation, and continuous learning, organizations foster a dynamic and adaptive environment where continuous improvement becomes ingrained in the <span class="No-Break">organization's DNA.</span></p>
			<p>Ultimately, driving continuous improvement in the BASE model goes beyond optimizing processes <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>or delivering better products; it cultivates a mindset of continuous learning, adaptation, and innovation. Empowering Value Managers, leveraging the BLAST framework, and embracing continuous feedback and learning position organizations for long-term success and <span class="No-Break">sustainable growth.</span></p>
