			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Tips for transitioning to a career in DevOps</h1>
			<p>This section revolves <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>around my DevOps journey. I will start <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>laying the groundwork by telling the story, followed by tips that can be extracted from it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Personal DevOps journey</h2>
			<p>In 2005, the <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>decision to attend college for mechanical engineering at the <em class="italic">University of Minnesota</em> was made. In college, I needed to take a C++ computer science class. This class was the extent of a software-related course that could be taken in college; however, the course got me inspired to continue exploring programming and what could be done with it. This fascination led to me purchasing a microcontroller board, similar to what is known as an Arduino. I ended up creating a hosted web page on a web server, which lead to a dorm room that could be monitored from a computer.</p>
			<p>I took a lab that focused on automation and robotics in my senior year in college, which inspired my interest in automation. The professor for my course also spurred my interest in automation. In the lab, we decided on a product we had to manufacture with no human interaction – we chose a wooden cribbage board. We were broken into groups of three and assigned a Fanuc six-axis robot, as well as a stage of the manufacturing process we were responsible for. My team was responsible for the packaging cell. After the cribbage board was created, it needed to be placed in a box, labeled, and shipped. I became very interested in the entire process and ended up spending far more time in the lab working on my cell, as well as helping other cells integrate with ours. The professor became the first academic mentor I had and was the reason I ended up taking the job I did out of college.</p>
			<p>My first job out<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> of college was working as a manufacturing engineer, a job I did not enjoy but took because of the exposure I was able to get with automation in an industrial setting. I sucked in as much as I could from my senior colleagues who worked in the automation department; one individual told me that it was impossible to master something quickly when you spend only a small portion of your time working on it. He recommended that I buy a used microcontroller to play around with on my own. I did and ended up setting up a home lab that grew into home automation tasks, and eventually into a fully automated home. </p>
			<p>My time as a manufacturing engineer ended and I started my career as an automation engineer working in the oil and gas industry in western North Dakota. During my tenure as an<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> automation engineer, I was exposed to <strong class="bold">supervisory control and data acquisition</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCADA</strong>) systems. The engineers working on SCADA systems were developing software in Java and using Maven, Subversion, and Eclipse. I began researching software development in my free time and began learning new programming languages and tools in my spare time. Once I felt comfortable with programming, I began applying for jobs as a software engineer for the same company. Eventually, I landed my first software engineering role. </p>
			<p>Software engineering was crazy fun – there was always something new to learn and a challenge to solve. I had a knack for picking up programming languages pretty quickly and wished to work with a more diverse code base. Another thing that I was struggling with was balancing work and life, or a lack thereof. I lived in Minnesota but needed to commute to western North Dakota frequently. I knew several individuals who worked at United Healthcare that continually encouraged me to apply. I applied to half a dozen software engineering roles I thought I was a good fit for.</p>
			<p>I also applied for a role as a technical agile coach, a role whose description sounded fascinating, but I did not feel I was overly qualified for. I had no experience using Agile, being a coach, or experience with DevOps. I ended up landing the role! Being a technical coach involves working with teams to help them further their DevOps practices. Overwhelmed did not begin to describe how I felt on the days leading up to my first day. I spent every hour I was awake studying DevOps and technical practices, only to get more discouraged as I learned how deep a rabbit hole the field was. On my first day, my manager sat me down and told me this: </p>
			<p>"<em class="italic">I know you don't have experience with DevOps or Agile; there were more qualified candidates than you, but you were chosen because of your desire and hunger to learn</em>." </p>
			<p> This individual<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> eventually became what I considered my first mentor. Under this individual, I grew both my technical skills as well as my soft skills. This individual helped me become more confident and encouraged me to attend Toastmasters to help with my public speaking. When I did leave their team, it was to tackle a new challenge – that is, building and leading a DevOps team of my own. </p>
			<p>The previous story was a goldmine of information; some of you may have missed some things, so let's break it down piece by piece.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Stay on track, but entertain your interests</h2>
			<p>While in<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> college, my degree did not allow me to take additional software courses, so I decided to follow up on this in my own time in a way that would not affect the time it took me to get my degree. This is not always an option; sometimes, you need to go all in. Unless I am certain of something, I usually hedge my decisions – that is, I continue doing what is working in parallel to my new idea/process. A notable example of this is as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer116" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.1.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Use your day appropriately&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1 – Use your day appropriately</p>
			<p>In the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>example, the individual in question has a job as a software analyst, but they would like to move into a higher-paying software engineering role. They have heard of software boot camps and are considering leaving their job to attend a 6-month boot camp. I strongly caution against doing this; first, you are not guaranteed a job after you graduate. You could go through the boot camp, only to come out and not be able to land a job. The second reason I do not feel it is a great idea to leave a job without a solid job offer in hand is that you will go into debt for tens of thousands of dollars. Instead, I recommend staying at your current job and taking advantage of the tuition reimbursement your company offers. Use these funds to take programming courses, get certifications, and even pursue an online degree. On top of this, something you can do even if your company does not offer tuition reimbursement is research and study on your own. Think of the amount of time you spend watching Netflix and playing video games; use a portion of this time to learn new things that will help you land your next job. I respect candidates who are self-taught and speak with many other leaders who have similar opinions. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Life is busy; prioritize and focus on things important to you</h2>
			<p>In college, I <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>was busy – too busy, honestly. I was volunteering as a ski patrol, taking 16 credits, working part-time, and trying to have a social life. It was not until the robotics lab that I realized I was going to need to reprioritize if I wanted to deliver a demo that I was proud of. In other labs, I was fine delivering something that was not my best work, so long as I would get good marks. I was extremely interested in the robotics lab and decided I wanted to get the most out of it so that I could use it in my career down the road. I prioritized the lab at the expense of having to give up being part of the ski patrol. Another example of this can be seen in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer117" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.2.jpg" alt="Figure 10.2 – Reprioritizing your time &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – Reprioritizing your time </p>
			<p>As you can see, there are a fixed number of hours in a day; you should also try to get adequate sleep, and you need to put in your time at work so that you can continue to perform at a good level. This leaves you with your free time; you are in control of how you spend this bucket of time. I recommend sitting down and determining areas that could be cut out or cut back to free up your time for activities you wish to prioritize.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Opportunity is often disguised in a deceptive facade</h2>
			<p>In the example <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>at the beginning of this section, I discussed how I took a job as a manufacturing engineer because I knew I would have the opportunity to work with the automation and control systems department; what was not said was that it took me a lot of time getting to know the company as an intern to discover this opportunity. This has happened several times in my career; in some instances, I have done upfront research and made a good decision; other times, I missed a fantastic opportunity. Take, for example, the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer118" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.3.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – Looking beyond what is seen on the surface&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – Looking beyond what is seen on the surface</p>
			<p>The preceding example is an extreme case for example's sake, but the logic of doing your research ahead of deciding on a major event still holds true.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Making an internal career change is sometimes easier than changing jobs and companies at the same time</h2>
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>are working for a company, there is a good chance you are building up a strong rapport with your management. If you have decided that you wish to pursue another career track, it is always advisable that you speak with your current employer first. In this example, another career track is referencing a shift away from the type of work you are currently doing. The example we will use to demonstrate this is of a software engineer moving to a career as a DevOps engineer:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer119" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.4.jpg" alt="Figure 10.4 – Internal versus external job change comparison&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.4 – Internal versus external job change comparison</p>
			<p>There is one thing I am not trying to say here – that applying for external jobs is not a good option. Applying to external jobs has worked for me many times in the past. Sometimes, applying internally shows quicker and more favorable results, as shown in the preceding diagram.</p>
			<p>Transitioning to a new career path requires new skills – skills you may have but that will not be evident unless an individual knows you personally. This is one reason transitioning internally can be easier. Another reason is that internal career moves can be made in stages or as part of a plan if you discuss them with your leadership. Finally, internal references for a job are gold. If you can apply for a job and have several people who can recommend you for the job, your chances of getting the job increase exponentially.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Apply for roles you find interesting, even if you do not meet all the requirements</h2>
			<p>Apply for jobs <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>you want, not ones you are completely qualified for. This will prove ineffective most of the time, but I have landed a job this way, as have many of my connections. Companies that use automated filtering mechanisms will filter you out if you do not meet all the requirements; one way to get around this is by including the time you have spent using said software on personal projects, not just professionally. As a hiring manager, I am not going to overlook you because you are missing 2 years of experience with a certain language or tool. </p>
			<p>The problem with setting years of experience requirements for jobs is that it only works if everyone learns at the same pace. However, most hiring managers are aware that this is not true.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Things to avoid during the interview process</h1>
			<p>In the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> section, I told a story about my successes and how they helped me get into DevOps. Now, I would like to spend a few pages reminiscing on my failures, or more so my failed attempts to land a job. To start, we will travel back to 2008.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Avoid providing inaccurate or misleading information when applying for a position</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">The time incorrect information cost me a job.</em></p>
			<p>In my junior year of college, I began looking for internships. I applied to one job that required applicants to be pursuing a degree in computer science; I was pursuing a degree in industrial engineering. When the question came up on the questionnaire asking if I was currently enrolled in a computer science program, I answered yes. A week later, I received a call from the recruiter and we began discussing the job; it was a very short discussion that ended with me being sent a link to a technical aptitude test. I must have done OK on it because I made it to the next round, which was onsite. The company paid for me to fly out, as well as put me up in a hotel. I was required to bring my transcripts onsite, which I went through in my first meeting. I was then asked, <em class="italic">I thought you were a computer science major?</em>. Needless to say, the encounter ended with me having a broken ego, which could have been avoided if I would have followed the golden rule of applying for jobs: always provide accurate information. If I had been upfront, I may still have been offered the opportunity, but because I was not honest in my initial application, I was put on the hard pass list.</p>
			<p>A rule that <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>should always be followed is being honest when applying for jobs, as well as on your social profiles. In my case, I knowingly provided false information, but unintentionally providing incorrect information can have the same results. Looking back, there is one word I would use to describe what I did: selfish. I chose to put my wants above what was required by the company. In doing so, the company wasted money interviewing me, flying me out to meet in person, and providing me with a hotel. It was a huge betrayal of trust when they learned I knowingly provided false information. I would not have hired me either – I may have had a chance had I been honest. Avoid going to an interview without fully understanding the requirements of the position.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Did you even read the job description?</em></p>
			<p>A candidate passed the recruiter screening for a DevOps role on my team and quickly moved on to the face-to-face technical interview. For every question I asked the individual, they responded with examples where they used Python to solve a similar problem. At the end of the interview, I gave the candidate this feedback: </p>
			<p>Though you seem highly skilled in using Python, we are looking for an individual who has more hands experience using Golang; would you be willing to go through your experience working with Golang? </p>
			<p>The candidate answered truthfully that they did not have experience using Golang outside of making slight code modifications. Unfortunately, the candidate did not get the job and could have saved their time if they had fully read the job description: <em class="italic">Senior DevOps Engineer – Golang Experience</em>. </p>
			<p>In the preceding example, the candidate could have avoided an awkward conversation if they had spent a little more time researching the role and requirements instead of jumping into preparation right away. It was clear that the individual was a strong engineer, but on the given team, the ability to mentor others in Golang was a requirement that was discussed in the job description. It is always OK to ask the recruiter if the job description is vague or if you are uncertain about something.</p>
			<p>There are four areas where you must come into an interview prepared:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Culture</strong>: Understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker494"/>the culture of a company will help you get through the initial screening process by a recruiter. If you can show how you can amplify the culture, it may be a deciding factor on why you end up receiving the job.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technical Needs</strong>: This is necessary. If you can't show that you have a solid understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>of the area where the team is looking for support, you will not get a job.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Industry</strong>: If you <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>are applying for a job in the financial industry, at a minimum, you should read up on the industry. In the best case, you already work in the industry.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Second-tier responsibilities</strong>: These are the teams you will be interacting with that <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>require additional knowledge outside of what is required to directly do your job.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker498"/> will discuss the career-wrecking consequences poor communication with recruiters can have.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Avoid neglecting to respond to recruiters after you have applied for a position</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Failure to respond.</em></p>
			<p>While working in the oil and gas industry, I had an initial interview with a recruiter, after which I took off for a week of work-related travel, followed by a week-long vacation. </p>
			<p>During my travel and vacation, I neglected to check my emails and missed two calls from the recruiter. When I finally came back to reality, I got back to the recruiter and learned I was no longer being considered for the role. Honestly, I had forgotten about it, but it did teach me a lesson I hope to pass on to you: </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Always have a communication strategy when applying for jobs.</em></p>
			<p>In my example, I could have set up an auto-reply that stated I would not be able to respond to emails until I returned from my travels. This way, the recruiter would have been more likely to grant me additional time to respond. Better, inform the recruiter of upcoming <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>work and personal plans you have coming up in the short term so that any confusion can be avoided. After interviewing, you decide that you are no longer interested in a job, do the polite thing, and inform the recruiter you are no longer interested in preserving your relationship for opportunities that may arise down the road. When applying for jobs, it is important to follow<a id="_idIndexMarker500"/> the <strong class="bold">LinkedIn, Email, and Phone</strong> (<strong class="bold">LEP</strong>) protocol, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer120" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.5.jpg" alt="Figure 10.5 – LinkedIn, email, and phone follow-up protocol&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.5 – LinkedIn, email, and phone follow-up protocol</p>
			<p>The preceding diagram shows the practices that can increase the chances for success after initial contact with a recruiter. Next, we will cover the importance of consistent information across platforms.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Avoid inconsistent information across social profiles and your resume </h2>
			<p>When on LinkedIn, you will run across profiles of people who have highly exaggerated job titles, appear to be skilled at everything, and have rudimentary fluency in six languages:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer121" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.6.jpg" alt="Figure 10.6 – LinkedIn versus reality&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.6 – LinkedIn versus reality</p>
			<p>The preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>example is meant to be an exaggerated version of what you will run across, but it also should cheer you on and tell you to keep your head up – most people are not as well off as their social profiles state. Exaggerating yourself on LinkedIn and other social profiles can adversely affect you, especially if you are currently applying for jobs. </p>
			<p>Exaggerated information will get you noticed but once the full story is discovered, your reputation will take a hit.</p>
			<p>So far, we have discussed things you should avoid doing to increase your chances of a positive outcome from an interview. Next, we will cover things you should do during the interview process to increase your chances of landing a job. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Things to do during the interview process</h1>
			<p>Throughout<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> the many interviews I have been part of, both as the interviewer and the interviewee, I have come across several things that had a surprisingly positive effect on the process. In this section, I will cover several of these.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Discuss your side projects</h2>
			<p>Not all side projects hold weight when you are interviewing for a DevOps position; your rock collection holds little importance in an interview, but using a Raspberry Pi to create an AI that can distinguish between distinct types of rocks is cool and should be brought up. Use the discussion and your judgment to determine if your project holds significance. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">You're interested in home automation? Me too! </em></p>
			<p>I was in an interview for a lead engineering position and had made it through the initial interview with the hiring manager, as well as the technical interview. During a final follow-up interview, I was told it was down to me and one other individual. The conversation was more laid back than the previous discussions; the hiring manager told me he had been working on upgrading his cabin's internet connection so that it could handle more sophisticated home automation.</p>
			<p>I took this opportunity to start discussing the home automation project I was working on. I do not believe this was the deciding factor that landed me the job; however, it did not hurt my chances either. </p>
			<p>I was able to discuss topics such as wireless topologies and the C programming language because I mentioned my home automation side project, things that would have otherwise gone unnoticed as they were not part of my resume or things that I worked on in my professional work. It becomes even more important to discuss your side projects if you are looking for your first job in the DevOps field and have little real-world experience. Discussing your side projects will show the interviewer that you are excited about DevOps and excited about learning new things.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Come prepared, ready to discuss tool alternatives</h2>
			<p>DevOps tools come, DevOps tools go – that is the reality of it. If you have experience using GitHub and a company uses GitLab, do not worry about it! Be prepared to discuss similarities <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>and differences between the two; show the interviewers you have done your homework and read up on the tool. The following table shows tools that can be used interchangeably during the interview process:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer122" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.7.jpg" alt="Figure 10.7 – Tool alternatives&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.7 – Tool alternatives</p>
			<p>Sometimes, companies have hard tool requirements for candidates, but more times than not, if you have used a comparable tool, the knowledge will be seen as transferable. Cloud providers have a diverse collection of tools and require vast knowledge as well as certifications in some cases, which is why the skill sets may not be seen as transferable. </p>
			<p>If the company is open to interviewing you for a role where you will be working with Azure and you have only worked with AWS, make sure that you come prepared to discuss how the tools are related between the two providers. A useful resource in an instance like this would <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>be the following diagram, which was first discussed in <a href="B18117_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Specialized Skills for Advanced DevOps Practitioners</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer123" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.8.jpg" alt="Figure 10.8 – Cloud equivalents&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.8 – Cloud equivalents</p>
			<p>This idea can be applied to almost any tool or process; another applicable example is having experience using GitLab when the job is asking for experience with GitHub. The two both offer similar functionally in terms of repositories; just be prepared to discuss how GitLab also has the built-in functionality of CI/CD that GitHub Actions does.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Summary </h1>
