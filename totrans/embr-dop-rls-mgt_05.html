<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">DevOps is holistic</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">DevOps initiatives</span><a id="_idIndexMarker249"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1"> are holistic, as opposed to the isolated strategies of the past. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">DevOps considers the entire value stream and all of the individuals involved, rather than simply one person or a specific component of it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">We’re turning the traditional model on its head by designing our systems and procedures around our people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4">This is the reason why elite-performing DevOps teams can demonstrate a correlation between investment in information technology and financial performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.5">The underlying objective of these investments is in the growth and empowerment of individuals, enabling them to enhance processes and choose suitable technologies for themselves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.6">Empowering your workforce directly correlates to strengthening your productivity and making your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">company resilient.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">The field of DevOps has undergone significant expansion, extending its scope beyond the mere processes of release and deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">At the time of writing, it encompasses various stakeholders, including product owners, project managers, and all facets of the software development life cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">This primary factor has contributed to its growth as a holistic methodology, encompassing the relationship between the business operations team and clients, as well as the stages of product release and production monitoring. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">DevOps release management is a logical progression within the IT industry, emphasizing its effectiveness in enhancing organizational performance across </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">various industries.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">The implementation of DevOps has expanded to encompass various departments within a business, including customer support, marketing, product owners, project managers, program managers, developers, quality assurance teams, release or build teams, and infrastructure teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">The primary objective of DevOps is to enhance customer satisfaction and expedite delivery. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">Therefore, it is crucial for all parties involved to possess comprehensive visibility across the entire process, encompassing operations, planning, integration, testing, monitoring, delivery, and feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">Efficient integration of processes and tools is necessary to automate the smooth exchange and execution of information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.5">This method also enables all stakeholders to make a more effective contribution to the success and efficient implementation of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">the product.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">The success of a DevOps initiative depends on the efforts of many people working together effectively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">This means that an organization must remove all silos of information and execution as attainable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">It is common for start-up companies to embrace the use of DevOps due to the advantages of building their company’s operations from the ground up. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">However, recent macroeconomic indicators reveal that larger, more mature businesses are increasingly adopting DevOps practices, especially to optimize efficiency and achieve greater frequency and higher quality </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">software releases.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">The DevOps field encompasses</span><a id="_idIndexMarker250"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1"> a wide range of tools, with a significant portion of them being open source in origin. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">This has supplied engineers with an unprecedented amount of tools that can be selected to partake in hacking or experimentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">This phenomenon often presents unique difficulties since an excessive number of toolsets inside a workflow can lead to the creation of isolated silos of knowledge and implementation, resulting in both ambiguity and wastefulness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.4">The scenario is becoming rampant and problematic, necessitating a pivot toward solutions that offer superior integration and execution capabilities across a range of technologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.5">The best approach for this scenario would be to use a platform that provides extensive integration capabilities, such as GitLab, GitHub Actions, Plutora, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">even Zapier.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">To provide a comprehensive solution, beginning with client inception to receiving product feedback, businesses need a comprehensive integration platform that allows for effortless integration and execution across diverse tools, including in-house, proprietary tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">This approach is especially useful for mature companies because it gives them the freedom to keep their present investments in tools and procedures while simultaneously introducing new technologies in a targeted manner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">Rather than attempting everything from the beginning, mature companies can manage changes while concentrating on efficiency, automation, collaboration, a higher standard for releases, and greater </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">release frequency.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">DevOps release management ensures that all parties involved are aware of what features will be made available and when. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">This approach features the inclusion of robust traceability capabilities, analytics, and dashboards that aid in awareness of the left-to-right movement of information and task execution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">A good way to minimize dependence on other teams and promote self-service is with the use of tight integrations of data systems, CI/CD-based kiosks, and support from operations specialists to automate routine </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">business processes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">DevOps allows the team to improve their productivity and effectiveness by incorporating better end-to-end visibility and robust methods of collaboration, empowering everyone on the team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Being inclusive to everyone has the added benefit of improving the climate of mutual trust and cooperation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">This approach allows DevOps organizations to expand beyond the build and release phases of software development and permeate the whole software development life cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.4">This is especially helpful for large businesses since it protects their existing investments and improves their cash flow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.5">This offers organizations the possibility to test out new tools and techniques frequently while also keeping the ones that are fruitful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.6">In a nutshell, being holistic is excellent for speeding up digital transformations</span><a id="_idIndexMarker251"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1"> in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">large organizations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Now that you know why DevOps is a holistic practice, let’s dive deeper and discuss how this extends beyond people and carefully considers processes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">and technology.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">DevOps incorporates business teams into the development process</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">The term </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">DevOps</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1"> refers to more than simply the technical </span><a id="_idIndexMarker317"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">procedures and tools that allow you to consistently deploy your applications into production – it goes well beyond that in scope. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.2">As mentioned previously, it is a comprehensive strategy in which the entirety of the organization needs to recognize the legitimacy of the DevOps methodology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.3">To ensure that DevOps is incorporated into every project, it is necessary for sales and marketing to make it an inherent component of their workflows, and it must be treated seriously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.4">Similarly, it is important to place effective DevOps practices across a wide variety of departments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.5">This ensures that subsequent teammates who take ownership of the project in the future have an established framework to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">operate within.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">DevOps principles should be represented throughout all stages of a product’s lifespan, from development to maintenance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.2">These principles take into account every step of the production process, bringing about a cultural shift from the beginning to the end of the value stream. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.3">When a company implements DevOps, it has ripple effects throughout the company because it is a way of thinking, acting, and being that has to permeate every level of culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.4">This involves breaking down silos and fostering a cooperative atmosphere that extends far beyond the typical working environment in traditional organizations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.5">Admittedly, making the switch to DevOps can be challenging. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.6">For it to be successful, training is essential, as is strong support from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">senior management.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">Put another way, the tight cooperation and constant feedback that characterize the DevOps culture should not be confined to just development, testing, and operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.2">Otherwise, the business will end up in a position where they promote and sell deliverables that the group is unable to provide. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.3">This is why it is so important to engage other departments and keep them in the loop, such as accounting, marketing, and sales, along with others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.4">To accomplish the goals of increased efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and improved quality, it is important to involve the entirety of the production line. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.5">For instance, it is not feasible for the sales department to engage in a contract that operates in isolation from the product delivery team, who is unknowingly producing incremental portions of functional software that lack requirements or context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.6">All stakeholders within the firm must possess a shared perspective and depth of awareness to coordinate customer demand with current </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">delivery capabilities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">It is important to underscore</span><a id="_idIndexMarker318"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1"> that merely establishing job designations such as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">DevOps engineer</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1"> and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">director of DevOps</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">, as well as developing training and certification initiatives for DevOps, does not provide a sufficient level of knowledge or experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.2">The concept of DevOps can be understood as a cultural paradigm rather than the mere existence of isolated individuals or teams engaged in tool development or collaboration within their respective domains. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.3">This implies that all individuals within the organization are collectively engaged in the adoption and implementation of a unified DevOps methodology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.4">The DevOps philosophy requires everyone in an organization to act as per its tenets and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">guiding principles.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">Support from a qualified DevOps coach is crucial in transforming a company into a DevOps-oriented entity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.2">This transformation is achieved via the adoption of a comprehensive strategy that encompasses systems thinking and prioritizes the customer’s requests for quality products </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">and services.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">The previous illustration represents </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">the three ways</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1"> of DevOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.2">Respectively, from top to bottom, they are flow/systems</span><a id="_idIndexMarker331"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1"> thinking, feedback loops being amplified, and a culture of continual experimentation </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">and learning.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">Now that you are familiar with the standout features that make DevOps release management unique, let’s wrap up this chapter by discussing the ways that DevOps release management compares </span><a id="_idIndexMarker332"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">with legacy release management methodologies and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">traditional workflows.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">How do traditional release management methodologies stack up against DevOps?</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">Planning large releases, which requires</span><a id="_idIndexMarker333"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1"> a greater amount of work</span><a id="_idIndexMarker334"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1"> and risk, is a common focus of traditional methodologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.2">Complexity often arises fast while working in longer cycles with fewer releases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.3">In this setting, you will have strict deadlines and a laundry list of extras to meet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.4">Big releases may be spectacular, but they are certainly an inefficient method of production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.5">However, DevOps uses a different strategy; smaller releases are more manageable since they are simpler to comprehend and test. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.6">If things don’t go as planned, there is less damage to manage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.7">Essentially, DevOps allows your company to quickly adapt to fluctuating client demands by enabling faster, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">lighter releases.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1">When it comes to managing any kind of development, traditional techniques commonly make use of planning and scheduling systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.2">Many moving parts are normally associated with a development cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.3">This is especially true when using traditional methods as scheduling can be an especially tough challenge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.4">The DevOps methodology is founded upon the principles of frequent and incremental software releases, as well as the utilization of automation techniques by a specialized team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.5">This approach significantly enhances the efficiency of scheduling processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.6">The focus will usually center on short-term planning, typically for the next several weeks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.7">It is this that will give you an elevated level of awareness on the proper allotment of your team’s time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.8">Moreover, the establishment of a specialized team will facilitate efficient coordination, eliminating the need for allocating individuals in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">various capacities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1">Conventional approaches typically make a big deal out of an anticipated release of a new product version or upgrade. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.2">When a business adopts conventional approaches, significantly more effort and resources are invested in a single release, raising the stakes and the potential for failure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.3">In this context, engineers will frequently spend many hours in isolation before a major</span><a id="_idIndexMarker335"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1"> release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.2">This is often referred to as “crunch time.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.3">The developers labored for weeks, if not months, preparing for this release, and now they are making one last effort to fix any problems that may have popped up to launch on time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.4">On the other hand, instead of throwing a huge party every time a new release or upgrade is rolled out, DevOps teams operate in shorter, more regular cycles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.5">Because less effort will have been needed since the last development cycle, the risks of a release are significantly reduced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.6">The use of automated testing ensures that their environments are consistent and reliable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.7">Only when DevOps is sure the transition will be successful do they promote a product version to the next stage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.8">Notably, getting new features into production more quickly is made possible by ousting the concept of a release </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.1">window entirely.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1">When preparing for a release in the past, multiple people would need to be involved to compile all of the necessary information and data, resulting in a lengthy report that was then presented to upper management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.2">In many cases, lengthy reports represent a bottleneck since the reader isn’t sure which pieces of information are the most important or if those reports are still relevant by the time they receive them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.3">In contrast, when automated operations are carried out inside of the DevOps-centric team, it is possible for you to swiftly collate new information and respond to it effectively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.4">This means that you won’t have to waste time sitting down and clicking through multiple pages of data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.5">If you delegate the task of collecting application data to a DevOps-oriented team, you can ensure that each member of that team has a greater awareness of the information and data that is associated with the task at hand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.6">Not only does this minimize the time required to obtain the information, but it also minimizes the time required to get approval </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1">from management.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">Furthermore, organizations that follow traditional</span><a id="_idIndexMarker336"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1"> methods often avoid</span><a id="_idIndexMarker337"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1"> taking any unnecessary risks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.2">Because the culture is centered on employees doing all they can to avoid causing damage to the company, those employees are under an enormous amount of pressure to ensure that everything is flawless. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.3">However, in actuality, nothing will ever reach the pinnacle of perfection. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.4">DevOps engenders a culture that diverges significantly from conventional methods. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.5">The group embraces a culture of early failure recognition, acknowledging the inevitability of setbacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.6">Therefore, a robust framework and systematic approach are established to facilitate managed failure through ongoing testing, incremental deployments, and automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.7">The DevOps team embraces the perspective that the earlier a failure occurs, the lesser its consequences and the faster the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">eventual recovery.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">Notably, conventional strategies make use of a price-per-performance model, which examines the quantity of work that can be accomplished with the least amount of financial investment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.2">Adopting this strategy comes with several risks, the most significant being that it is tricky to reduce expenses while still maintaining the same capacity as before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.3">This is the reason why many businesses that use legacy strategies are forced to outsource operations frequently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.4">This concept of efficiency was expanded a lot further by DevOps, which added the notion of “flow,” given that the amount of time spent on new applications should be the strategic metric. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.5">This motivates the team to analyze cycle times to find any areas of waste and estimate genuine productivity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.6">This allows developers to focus their attention on activities that offer the greatest value to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1">the customer.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">With legacy methods, each individual performs their assigned work-in-progress before passing it over to their colleagues further down the value chain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.2">In this setting, they’ll be so concerned with finishing on time that they won’t bother making sure their work can be used in real-world conditions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.3">When this approach is taken, quality often suffers, and no one is held responsible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.4">In contrast, DevOps emphasizes the establishment of a cross-functional organization in which all members share responsibility for the successful completion of tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.5">Since producing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker338"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1"> high-quality software</span><a id="_idIndexMarker339"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1"> is the shared objective of the team, all members will agree on what constitutes a job well done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.2">Instead of stressing out about the minutia of their work, they are motivated by the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">greater picture.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1">The genesis of DocuSign</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">The tale of DocuSign started</span><a id="_idIndexMarker342"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1"> in the late 1990s, when Tom Gonser, a visionary entrepreneur and skilled software engineer, identified the shortcomings and complexities inherent in the conventional method of signing agreements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.2">Inspired by the growing power of the internet and irritated by the laborious paper-based processes, Gonser dreamed of a digital alternative that could transform the way that businesses and individuals fulfilled and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">conveyed agreements.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">With the help of co-founders Court Lorenzini and Eric Ranft, as well as other individuals, Tom Gonser founded DocuSign in 2003 to revolutionize the traditional method of signing contracts by transforming it into an online process that was simplified, secure, and fast. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.2">Their goal was to develop a system that would make it possible for individuals and corporations to digitally sign papers from any location in the world, freeing them from the limitations that were imposed by physical paperwork and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">geographical constraints.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">With determination and a strong conviction in the game-changing potential of the internet, Gonser and his team built the foundation of the platform’s technology, utilizing algorithmic cryptography and e-signature techniques to guarantee the legality and legitimacy of digital contracts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.2">In only a few years of its existence, DocuSign quickly rose to prominence in the e-signature industry thanks to its early success and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1">user-friendly interface.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">The transformation to DevOps</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">DocuSign has consistently</span><a id="_idIndexMarker343"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1"> embraced an Agile approach to development since its inception. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.2">However, progressing into DevOps processes proved to be quite challenging. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.3">Given the nature of their business, dealing with contracts and signatures, continuous integration and delivery pose significant challenges. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.4">Their entire existence revolves around the intricate transactional process of exchanging signatures and approvals, which is extremely difficult to test for from a software development standpoint. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.5">In the event of any errors occurring, such as a misattributed approval, it would pose a major threat to their business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.6">To enhance the efficiency of modern development, they utilized</span><a id="_idIndexMarker344"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1"> a highly efficient strategy known as an application </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">mockup</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">, or </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">mock</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1"> for short. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.2">Specifically, they use a mock for their internal API. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.3">The tool provides a simulated endpoint and delivers simulated responses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.4">Using this approach, DocuSign was able to seamlessly integrate its application testing approach with incident management and thoroughly test the application using simulations that closely resembled </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">real-world</span></span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker345"/></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1"> transactions.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">Obstacles encountered by DocuSign’s product team</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">One of the most important parts</span><a id="_idIndexMarker346"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1"> of the DevOps release management life cycle is continuous integration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.2">This is the stage where new features and updated code are added to and merged with the original codebase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.3">At each part of this process, we find and fix errors in the code using unit testing, and we update the source code appropriately. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.4">Let’s examine the unique challenges faced by the development team at DocuSign and discover how they </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">overcame them:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">Regulations concerning compliance and security</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">: DocuSign operates in the domain of confidential papers and legal contracts and must cope with the difficulty of complying with constantly changing requirements regarding compliance and security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.2">Product managers oversee the intricate domain of worldwide legislation, guaranteeing that the platform adheres to diverse industry compliance standards, legal frameworks, and linguistic complexities while upholding </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">data security.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">Improving the user experience in the face of complexity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">: Digitally signing documents is an extremely important process, and it presents a considerable challenge to simplify it without losing its functionality or security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.2">Product management must pay careful attention to strike a balance between efforts to improve the customer experience and the complexities of handling confidential documents and verifying </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">their legitimacy.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">Difficulties associated with integration and interoperability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">: The challenge for DocuSign’s product management was to achieve frictionless integration as well as compatibility with a wide variety of platforms and applications developed by other companies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.2">This is because organizations are using a vast array of digital solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.3">One of the most important things that DocuSign needed to do was make sure that it could easily integrate with the workflows and systems that its users already had </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">in place.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">The developers at DocuSign successfully established the principles of DevOps release management in their organization by creating a custom, in-house test framework that centered around their transactional mockup-based strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.2">This allowed the team to tackle the highly challenging task of performing automated integration testing against a complex application featuring intricate approval processes, secure graphical interfaces, and strongly encrypted API transactions within a CI/CD pipeline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.3">With the success of these innovative testing strategies, DocuSign was able to rapidly mature its business model so that it included new product lines and maintained its position as the industry-dominant e-signature product</span><a id="_idIndexMarker347"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1"> company that it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">is today.</span></span></p>
