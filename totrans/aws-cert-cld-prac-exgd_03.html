			<p>In this chapter, we discuss what <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) is, examine its brief history, and also aim to understand the AWS Global Infrastructure. The Global Infrastructure gives you access to AWS data centers across different continents, enabling you to build highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable solutions for your customers. In addition, you can also ensure that you place workloads closer to the location of your customers and fulfill any compliance or regulatory requirements.</p>
			<p>This key offering from AWS enables you to access and launch resources across different Regions. An in-depth understanding of this will help you meet your clients' requirements—adherence to regulatory and compliance requirements, <strong class="bold">disaster recovery</strong> (<strong class="bold">DR</strong>) solutions, and even cost savings—all leading to a better customer experience.</p>
			<p>We also look at the support plans offered by AWS to its customers. Your clients may require different levels of support, depending on the number and complexity of the applications they need to host. Choosing the right plan will be key to ensuring that you have all the support you need while managing your costs effectively and meeting any specific requirements.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>What is AWS?</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), a subsidiary of Amazon, is the largest public cloud-computing provider<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> in the world. It offers over 175 distinct services to its clients from its data centers located across the globe. These services are accessible over the internet (with some on-premises options available as well) on a metered pay-as-you-go model. Its customer base comprises start-ups, enterprise clients, and even governmental organizations such as the <strong class="bold">United States</strong> (<strong class="bold">US</strong>) Navy. </p>
			<p>Gartner Research creates a yearly report known as the <em class="italic">Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services</em>, and over the last few years has awarded AWS top position in the Leaders quadrant. </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>A quick history of AWS</h2>
			<p>AWS started its journey in 2002 when it began<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> to offer a few ad hoc services to the public. The timeline shown in the following screenshot provides an overview of some of its key milestones and its journey to date: </p>

			<p>In this section, we looked at a brief history<a id="_idIndexMarker059"/> of AWS and how it emerged as a cloud leader in the market. In the next section, we will examine the AWS Global Infrastructure, which is critical to its functionality and in being able to offer a vast array of cloud services to its clients.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Exploring the AWS Global Infrastructure</h1>
			<p>The AWS Global Infrastructure<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> comprises multiple data centers that house all the servers, storage devices, and networking equipment across different geographical <strong class="bold">regions</strong> around the globe.</p>
			<p>As AWS continues to expand its global footprint, it builds additional data centers, which ultimately leads to an increase in the number of Regions accessible to its customers. </p>
			<p>At the time of writing this document, the following screenshot depicts the current live Regions across the globe and includes upcoming ones too:</p>

			<p>An <strong class="bold">AWS Region</strong> is a physical location<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> where AWS will host a cluster<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> of <strong class="bold">data centers</strong>. Within a given Region, these data centers are built such that small groups of the larger cluster are logically and physically separated from each other by a distance that falls within 100 <strong class="bold">kilometers</strong> (<strong class="bold">km</strong>) (60 miles) of each other. These logically and physically separated groups of data centers form<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> what we call <strong class="bold">Availability Zones</strong> (<strong class="bold">AZs</strong>).</p>
			<p>AWS currently<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> spans 77 AZs within 24 geographical regions around the world, and has announced plans for 18 more AZs and 6 more AWS Regions in Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland.</p>
			<p>Let's take a closer look at what Regions and AZs are.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Regions</h2>
			<p>A Region<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> will consist of a minimum of two AZs, and many even<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> consist of three or more. The North Virginia Region (N. Virginia or <strong class="source-inline">us-east-1</strong>) consists of six AZs. Usually, when AWS launches a new service, it is first deployed in the North Virginia Region.</p>
			<p>You may be curious about the purpose of having so many Regions and how this would be useful. Simply put, having multiple Regions across the globe will allow AWS to further entice customers in those locations to sign up for its services. However, this may lead to another question. If there is nothing to stop you from accessing the services in an AWS Region on the other side of the globe, why have so many? Read on to find out why.</p>
			<p>AWS's multi-Region strategy<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> enables you (the customer) to derive the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify infrastructure resources closer to your end users, where you can host your application and reduce network latency, resulting<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> in a good <strong class="bold">user experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>)</li>
				<li>Identify infrastructure within political and national borders to adhere to strict data sovereignty and compliance regulations</li>
				<li>Isolate groups of resources from each other to allow you to fulfill any failover or DR scenarios in case major regional outages occur</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With regard to the second benefit, many services are based on Regions. This means that before you deploy a resource using that service, you will need to select the Region in which you want to deploy it. For example, if you wish to launch a new Windows-based virtual server<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> (we call these <strong class="bold">Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">EC2</strong>) instances on AWS), you will need to choose the Region in which you want to place it. In fact, with EC2 instances, you also need to specify the AZ within the Region where you want to launch the server. Let's look at AZs next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>AZs</h2>
			<p>AZs are the logical and physical grouping of data centers<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> within a given Region. Each Region will have two or more AZs, as mentioned earlier. An AZ is a logical representation of a metropolitan area where AWS has deployed one<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> or more data-center facilities. These data centers will house hardware components such as servers, storage, and network equipment, all fitted with redundant power, connectivity, cooling, and security controls. </p>
			<p>The primary purpose of having multiple AZs is to offer customers the opportunity to build highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable solutions. This is made possible by the fact that the AZs within a Region are connected to each other over high-bandwidth, low-latency private metro-fiber links, delivering high throughput connections between the zones.</p>
			<p>An important aspect of this configuration is that you can achieve synchronous replication between AZs. This means that you can deploy multiple copies/replicas of your application on servers across the AZs. If there is an outage at one of the AZs, you can continue to serve your customers from the replica workloads running in the other AZs.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 2.3</em>, if there was an outage in AZ <strong class="bold">A</strong>, users' traffic would be directed only to the servers offering the exact same services in AZ <strong class="bold">B</strong>. The architecture is such that users will not be made aware of the outage, and this will improve the UX substantially. </p>
			<p>This is a viable design because we can place our replica application servers across multiple AZs and distribute end-user traffic across them using an Amazon <strong class="bold">Elastic Load Balancer</strong> (<strong class="bold">ELB</strong>). The ELB<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> not only distributes user traffic to the application servers, but also monitors the health of those servers and sends traffic only if those servers are online and responding. We examine Amazon ELBs in detail later, in <a href="B17124_09_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor223"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">High Availability and Elasticity on AWS</em>. You can see a diagram of the aforementioned design here:</p>

				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_02_03.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – User traffic is temporarily directed to only the server(s) in AZ B, &#13;&#10;until AZ A comes back online&#13;&#10;" width="658" height="478"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – User traffic is temporarily directed to only the server(s) in AZ B, until AZ A comes back online</p>
			<p>So, now that we understand the differences between Regions and AZs and how AZs can be used to help build<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> highly available solutions, we can proceed<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> to look at another component of the AWS Global Infrastructure: Edge locations.</p>
			<p>In this next section, we will discuss how edge locations can be used<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> to build a <strong class="bold">content delivery network</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDN</strong>) and offer caching services.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Edge locations</h2>
			<p>In addition to Regions and AZs, AWS also offers another type of hosting service, called edge locations. These edge locations also host the physical server infrastructure, massive amounts of storage devices, and high-bandwidth networking equipment. In addition, AWS edge computing services provide infrastructure and software that enable data to be processed and analyzed closer to the end customer. This includes deploying AWS-managed hardware and software to locations outside AWS data centers, and even onto customer-owned devices themselves.</p>
			<p>As discussed previously, most resources that you deploy on AWS are going to be Region-based. For example, an EC2<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> instance can be deployed in the North Virginia Region, within a specific AZ. Let's assume that the servers host media files<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> and you want to distribute those files to your end users globally. For users based in Sydney, Australia, this would mean pulling these large media files across the public internet directly from the server located in the US, each time they make a request for those files. </p>
			<p>With edge locations, you can cache frequently accessed files on servers located closer to those users based in Sydney. This means that the time it takes to download those frequently accessed files is drastically reduced, and this improves the UX significantly.</p>
			<p>A prime tenant of edge location services is Amazon's CloudFront. This is a CDN service designed to help you create distribution points for your content. The distribution points are created at these edge locations in each Region, depending on your configuration. Your content is then cached at the edge location closest to the end users who attempt to access your content. </p>
			<p>Edge locations do more than just cache content. For example, <strong class="bold">Amazon Simple Storage Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">Amazon S3</strong>) is an object-storage solution<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> that allows you to create containers (we call them <strong class="bold">buckets</strong> in AWS) in each<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> Region. You can upload any type of data to a bucket and store it. If you need to upload large files to a bucket anywhere in the world, you may experience high latency and lower throughput, as the data needs to traverse the public internet. </p>
			<p>Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a feature of Amazon S3 that allows you to upload your content to AWS buckets via these edge locations. Once your data reaches an edge location closer to you, it then traverses the AWS backbone network using high-speed links. This greatly improves the upload speed of your data to Amazon S3 buckets. You can actually test your upload transfer rates<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> using a tool provided by AWS, which is available at <a href="https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html">https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html</a>. The tool will attempt to transfer a sample file from your browser (your location) to various Amazon S3 Regions and display transfer rates comparing transfer with AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration and without.</p>
			<p>Edge locations<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> are connected to AWS Regions through the AWS backbone network. This comprises fully redundant, multiple 100 <strong class="bold">Gigabit Ethernet</strong> (<strong class="bold">GbE</strong>) parallel fiber<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> connections that substantially improve throughput and offer low-latency connectivity.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot illustrates the current edge locations<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> across the globe. AWS continues to build and deploy more edge locations based on consumer demand and business requirements:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – Edge locations and regional edge caches across the globe. Image courtesy of AWS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/">https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/</a>)</p>
			<p>Edge locations do have some limitations in that their cache size will fill up over time, and to cater for new content, they will evict content not recently accessed. This would mean that the next time someone tries to access that particular piece of content, it will need to be retrieved from the origin<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>al source. To help reduce the number of times<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> this happens, AWS also offers <em class="italic">regional edge caches</em>, which we discuss next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Regional edge caches</h2>
			<p>In addition to edge locations, we also have regional edge caches. Regional edge caches have more storage and offer large cache sizes. As you can imagine, edge location storage devices will contain massive amounts of cached content—these could be images, videos, documents, and so on. Their primary purpose is to store frequently accessed content. As content becomes stale, it is evicted from the cache to make room for newer content. This means that when some content is infrequently accessed, end users will again have to pull those files from the original server to access them. </p>
			<p>Regional edge caches are highly useful in such situations. There are far fewer regional edge caches<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> than edge locations deployed across the globe, but they are strategically placed. They offer additional storage and cache that will continue to hold the data not accessed frequently for a longer period of time than with standard edge locations.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, regional edge caches<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> will also evict data that is not being accessed, but in the interim period, if another end user on the other side of the globe makes a request for that same data, then the process repeats, whereby that data is then cached at an edge location closer to that specific user.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Regional services</h2>
			<p>We discussed earlier that most services<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> on AWS are Region-based, and you need to first select a Region and subsequently create resources of that service in the Region. For example, if you wish to launch<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> a <strong class="bold">Relational Database Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">RDS</strong>) database, you must first select the Region you want to deploy your database in and then launch your chosen database<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> engine in that Region. </p>
			<p>This is because the underlying physical infrastructure that will host that service (servers, storage, or databases) will reside in the Region you are working in. This is why most services on AWS are Region-based.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you will need to select a Region before you can launch a new Windows server. Similarly, if you need to access a given server that you have previously deployed, you must know the Region in which it is located:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer019" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_02_05.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Selecting a Region to access the EC2 instances (servers) deployed in that Region&#13;&#10;" width="1217" height="408"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – Selecting a Region to access the EC2 instances (servers) deployed in that Region</p>
			<p>Now that we have understood the core components of the AWS Global Infrastructure, we can move on to discuss how various types of services are offered to clients. Some services<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> require you to specify the Region in which you wish to consume<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> it, and others are accessible globally, without the need to specify a specific Region. Let's discuss this in the following section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Global services</h2>
			<p>Although most services are Region-based, as we have mentioned already, there are some services that fall under the category of global services. This may seem contradictory to the logic given<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> previously that a given service needs to obviously run from physical infrastructure located in each Region. While this is true, AWS will, nevertheless, present the service as a global offering. In other words, regardless of which Region you happen to be working in, you can directly access those global services from any location.</p>
			<p>The reason for these few services being presented as global services<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> is that you want the resources created in those services to be accessible globally and, in many cases, to be unique across all Regions within your AWS account. </p>
			<p>Consider, for example, individual<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> user accounts (<strong class="bold">Identity and Access Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) users) in your AWS account. It makes sense to have unique accounts for each member of staff in your organization who needs to work with services and resources in your AWS account. Imagine<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> having to create multiple accounts for a given developer in each Region. That would only mean a huge management overhead.</p>
			<p>Although not an exhaustive list, the following services are presented as global services on AWS:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">AWS IAM</strong>—A service offered by AWS<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> to enable you to grant access to services and resources in your AWS Account. AWS IAM<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> allows you to create IAM users for your staff who need access to those services, define permissions, configure groups, and set up roles. We discuss AWS IAM in <a href="B17124_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor068"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Identity and Access Management</em>. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon CloudFront</strong>—A CDN service that allows you to create distribution points for your content<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> for a specific origin server. The Amazon CloudFront<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> services will cache content locally at edge locations closest to those users who request access to your content.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon Route 53</strong>—A highly available<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>, scalable, and fully managed<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> cloud <strong class="bold">Domain Name System</strong> (<strong class="bold">DNS</strong>). You can use Amazon Route 53<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> to register new domain names, configure domain records, and design global routing policies for various use cases, such as an active/passive solution for building a highly available solution.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon S3</strong>—Although Amazon S3 buckets<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> need to be created<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> in each Region and those buckets are therefore Region-specific, the service itself is presented as a global service. When you access the Amazon S3 console, you do not need to select a given egion. Instead, you are presented with a list of buckets across all Regions that you have created, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer020" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_02_06.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Amazon S3, displaying all buckets in a specific AWS account across all &#13;&#10;Regions where they have been deployed &#13;&#10;" width="976" height="541"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Amazon S3, displaying all buckets in a specific AWS account across all Regions where they have been deployed </p>
			<p>In addition to global and regional services, AWS also offers certain services that are meant to be consumed<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> on premises. These include services that can be used to build hybrid cloud models or assist in the migration of your on-premises workloads to AWS. We examine some of these in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>On-premises services</h2>
			<p>Although AWS is a public cloud vendor, they also provide certain services that are hosted at their clients' data centers<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> on-premises. This enables clients to bring the management capabilities of AWS services for certain services<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> to their local data centers. </p>
			<p>Some on-premises services are intended to also facilitate a hybrid cloud deployment solution, whereas other on-premises services can be used to help migrate data from local data centers to the AWS cloud via offline routes where bandwidth constraints may be an issue. Another reason for such on-premises offerings is that it helps address the needs of certain clients who have strict data-residency laws. </p>
			<p>Some services that are designed to be hosted or consumed on-premises<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon Snow Family</strong>—These<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> are physical enclosure units<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> that contain <strong class="bold">solid-state drives</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSDs</strong>), compute hardware, and networking components that are shipped to client sites. The AWS Snow Family comprises Snowball Edge Devices, Snowcone, and Snowmobile. They can be used for copying <strong class="bold">terabytes</strong> (<strong class="bold">TB</strong>) of data to <strong class="bold">petabytes</strong> (<strong class="bold">PB</strong>) of data onto the devices, which can be returned to AWS so that the data can be copied into Amazon S3. They also offer compute capability so that data can be processed and analyzed as required while it is being copied to the devices. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon Storage Gateway</strong>—This enables users to connect their on-premises storage with Amazon S3, offering different gateway options designed to enable offloading of their storage data to Amazon S3. They will continue to have seamless connectivity<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> to that data from their on-premises servers. Depending on the configuration option chosen, Amazon Storage Gateway can maintain a small subnet of frequently accessed data locally, with the bulk of that data in Amazon S3, reducing the total storage hardware needed on premises, which leads to lower capital costs. Alternatively, if on-premises applications are extremely sensitive to network latency, then the Amazon Storage Gateway service can provide data backup capabilities, with the ability to send snapshots of locally stored data to Amazon S3. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon Outposts</strong>—This is a 42U rack that can scale from 1 rack to 96 racks to create pools of compute<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> and storage capacity, hosted at your local data center. The U refers to rack units or "U-spaces" and is equal to 1.75 inches in height. A standard height is 48U (a 7-foot rack). Amazon Outposts offers all the management software and capabilities of AWS to manage your EC2 instances, as well as storage and RDS database services locally on-premises. <p>This enables low-latency connectivity, local data processing, and adherence to local data-residency<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> requirements. Other services<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> that can<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> be run locally on Amazon Outposts are <strong class="bold">Elastic Container Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">ECS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Elastic Kubernetes Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">EKS</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Elastic MapReduce</strong> (<strong class="bold">EMR</strong>) clusters. Yet another service that you can run locally in your data center is host-object storage services using Amazon S3 on Outposts. This can help you meet your local data-processing and data-residency needs.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, we examined the AWS Global Infrastructure. This is the underlying core set of infrastructure components hosted across a vast array of AWS data centers around various strategically placed geographical regions. AWS gives you access to all its Regions, enabling you<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> to host your applications to meet a wide range of use cases—from ensuring that your applications are located as close as possible to end users, to enabling you to meet any compliance or data-sovereignty laws.</p>
			<p>We also reviewed the key difference between Regions, AZs, and edge locations, and learned how you can use these to build highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant architectures at a very high level. We also discussed how edge locations can be used to offer low-latency access to your content and digital assets.</p>
			<p>Next, we moved on to discuss the difference between regional-based services and global services. We also examined some services that are offered to run on-premises at clients' data centers.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will review AWS support plans. As you start to build solutions on the AWS platform, choosing the right support plan is extremely important to ensure that you have the correct level of support for your use case, while ensuring you manage your costs effectively.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Choosing the right AWS support plan for your business</h1>
			<p>AWS is strongly<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> focused on delivering excellent customer support. Different businesses, however, require varied levels of support, and at AWS, each customer is catered for. In addition to standard customer support services such as resolving issues with account setups or billing, AWS offers an extensive range of technical support to help clients adopt cloud technologies faster and more efficiently. </p>
			<p>Even if you have vast technical experience within your on-premises data centers, moving to the cloud requires learning a new set of skills, understanding how to architect solutions for the cloud, and being cost-effective at the same time. AWS hires and trains some of the best engineers, and their support team is highly proficient with the technologies they offer.</p>
			<p>There are <em class="italic">four support plans</em> on offer from AWS, discussed in the following sections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Basic support plan</h2>
			<p>Regardless of which support<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> plan you ultimately decide to choose for your business, every account is subscribed to the Basic support plan. Now, before this piques your interest, I should point out that this plan does not come with <em class="italic">any real technical support</em>. The Basic support plan<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> is completely free and offers customer support for any account-related issues such as bill payment or if you have issues logging in to your account. You also get access to publicly available documentation, whitepapers, and support forums. You can access the Basic support services via email, chat, and phone 24/7, and the phone support involves getting Amazon to call you on your landline or mobile—so, they pay the call charges. </p>
			<p>In addition, you also get access to seven basic checks on the Trusted Advisor tool, which helps you to identify best practices for increasing performance and improving security. We will take a look at the Trusted Advisor tool in <a href="B17124_13_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor317"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Management and Governance on AWS</em>. Finally, you also get alerts regarding interruptions to any AWS services that may impact your deployed<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> resources via the <strong class="bold">Personal Health Dashboard</strong> (<strong class="bold">PHD</strong>). The PHD is discussed in detail in the <a href="B17124_13_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor317"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Management and Governance on AWS</em>, as well.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Developer support plan</h2>
			<p>AWS recommends subscribing to the Developer<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> support plan if <em class="italic">you are experimenting or testing in AWS</em>; refer to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/</a> for more information. The Developer support plan<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> is a cost-effective solution for getting support with non-production<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> workloads. These are websites or applications that are still at the development stage and do not yet support any critical business requirement. If you are satisfied with periods of extended downtime for such workloads, the Developer support plan is offered at a very reasonable price. </p>
			<p>While you get technical support with the Developer support plan, it is limited to generic support primarily around technical configurations with AWS use cases, and the support team will not be able to discuss specific application-layer problems that you might be having. Support is also only available via email (no phone support is offered) during business hours, with access to Cloud Support associates. While you can raise an unlimited number of cases, the case severity and response times are <em class="italic">within 24 hours</em> for general guidance and <em class="italic">within 12 hours</em> for system-impaired issues.</p>
			<p>As with the Basic support plan, you only get access to the seven core checks on the AWS Trusted Advisor tool under the Developer support plan.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Business support plan</h2>
			<p>The Business support plan<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> is recommended for production environments and enables companies to get technical support with their workloads on AWS. Examples range from resolving<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> an issue with an RDS database that may have failed, where you need to perform a restore from backup, to more complex troubleshooting issues and problem resolutions. </p>
			<p>The Business support plan offers full 24/7 support via email, chat, and telephone. Depending on the severity of the issue, different response times are offered. For example, if you have a production system that is down, you can expect support from a Cloud Support engineer within 1 hour. Also, unlike the Developer support plan, which offers more generic support covering typical AWS use cases, the Business support plan includes helping you troubleshoot interoperability issues between AWS resources and third-party software. The level of support offered is therefore contextual to your use case.</p>
			<p>For an additional cost, you also get access to AWS <strong class="bold">Infrastructure Event Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IEM</strong>). This service<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> offers guidance and operational support to help you with your project launch events or migration tasks. This includes evaluating your AWS environment readiness, identifying<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> any potential risks and ways to mitigate them, followed by ongoing support during your actual launch, and a post-event review.</p>
			<p>Finally, the Business support plan<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> also entitles you to receive a full set of AWS Trusted Advisor checks that allow you to cross-reference your workloads against best practices and receive recommendations across five categories: <strong class="bold">Cost Optimization</strong>, <strong class="bold">Security</strong>, <strong class="bold">Fault Tolerance</strong>, <strong class="bold">Performance</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Service Limits</strong>. We will discuss the key features of the AWS Trusted Advisor tool in the <a href="B17124_13_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor317"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Management and Governance on AWS.</em></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Enterprise support plan</h2>
			<p>The Enterprise support plan<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> is the <em class="italic">crème de la crème</em> of all the support plans on offer from AWS. You would expect the best level of service under this plan given its price tag, which starts at <strong class="bold">US Dollars</strong> (<strong class="bold">USD</strong>) $15,000 per month. The Enterprise support plan is naturally appropriate for very large organizations, such as multinational companies or companies that have extensively large workloads spread globally. </p>
			<p>Examples of such companies include Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Dropbox. The Enterprise Support plan stands out because<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> of its different VIP-style offerings such as a designated <strong class="bold">Technical Account Manager</strong> (<strong class="bold">TAM</strong>). Your TAM will actively monitor your environment and work closely with you to actively guide your team through planning, design, and implementation of your cloud projects. </p>
			<p>Your TAM<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> will assist with optimization tasks and suggest various best-practice methodologies, and also provide access to the best experts within AWS. Another key offering is access to Well-Architected reviews. This allows you to get access to a senior AWS solutions architect who can conduct an audit of your solutions deployed on AWS. AWS will provide guidance and best practices to help you design reliable, scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective solutions.</p>
			<p>In terms of<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> <strong class="bold">service-level agreements</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAs</strong>), you get full 24/7 email, chat, and phone support, with access to senior cloud engineers and with a 15-minute response time for business-critical technical issues.</p>
			<p>Here is a table highlighting some key benefits<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> of the different AWS support plans:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>You can find a full breakdown<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> of each plan at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/</a>.</p>
			<p>In this section, we reviewed the four AWS support plans, ranging<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> from a free offering of the Basic support<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> plan to the all-inclusive VIP-style treatment of the Enterprise support plan. A key difference between the plans is to know which plans offer 24/7 technical support via phone and chat and which do not. Additionally, not all plans give you full access to all Trusted Advisor reports that can help you ascertain whether your workloads<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> and solutions follow best practices and security guidelines.</p>
			<p>Make sure you know the key difference in the response times<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> for production and business-critical issues and which additional features are offered with the Enterprise plan, such as access to a designated TAM.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will look at the AWS Service Health Dashboard, which enables you to get a visual on the current status of each service across every Region. Any outages of a given service are highlighted on the service dashboard.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Overview of the AWS Service Health Dashboard</h1>
			<p>AWS publishes service health status<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/> across all data centers located in its various Regions. This is the first place you should consider investigating if a service appears to be non-responsive. AWS offers SLAs for its various service offerings and you can<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> get a full list of these at https://aws.amazon.com/legal/service-level-agreements/. </p>
			<p>You can see an example overview of the AWS Service Health Dashboard here:</p>

			<p>In the next section, we move on to look at the AWS PHD. Similar to the previously discussed Service Health<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> Dashboard, the PHD provides information on services that affect your resources and workloads. You can access the PHD once logged in to the AWS Management Console of your AWS Account. We look at how to create your AWS Account in <a href="B17124_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor050"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring AWS Accounts, Multi-Account Strategy, and AWS Organizations</em>, as well as understanding the AWS PHD.</p>
			<p>While the AWS Service Health Dashboard provides general information on all of AWS services and their availability, if there are any outages, the PHD provides more tailored information, wherein it reports on issues that may affect your applications and resources, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – AWS PHD</p>
			<p>Some of the key benefits of the PHD<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> include the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Personalized view of service health</strong>—This includes information that will allow you to quickly identify any issues with any AWS service that may impact your resources or applications.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Proactive notifications</strong>—You also get access to notifications such as those for upcoming schedule changes that may impact you. This will enable you to plan for those scheduled changes accordingly. You can also set up alerts to receive timely and relevant information<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> using a service called Amazon CloudWatch Events.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Detailed troubleshooting guidance</strong>—Alerts that you receive will also include necessary remediation details and any action that you may need to take. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration and automation</strong>—The PHD integrates with CloudWatch events, which can be used to trigger automated tasks such as Lambda functions. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Aggregate health events across AWS Organizations</strong>—AWS Organizations is a service that helps you manage multiple AWS accounts centrally. You can use the PHD to aggregate all notifications for every account in your organization. This<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> gives you a holistic view of real-time events, operational issues, or any scheduled maintenance across all accounts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So far, we have covered some basic components of the AWS Global Infrastructure, compared regional services with global services, and examined the AWS Service Health Dashboard and the PHD. You should note that you must agree to certain terms and conditions before using any service on the AWS Platform. Specifically, you must follow the AWS AuP, which we take a look at next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>The AWS AuP</h1>
			<p>Although it's obvious, you need to remember<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> that when you sign up for an AWS account for your personal or business use, you must comply with the AWS AuP. This policy provides information on acceptable use of the services offered by AWS and describes prohibited uses. It is imperative that you adhere to the guidelines in the policy or you risk your account being suspended or terminated, which may well affect the workloads you deploy for your business. </p>
			<p>You can review the full<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> policy at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/">https://aws.amazon.com/aup/</a>. By signing up for the services offered by AWS, you automatically agree to the latest version of this policy.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we examined the AWS Global Infrastructure in detail. We understood that, as the customer, you can choose which AWS Region to deploy your resources and applications in, and looked at the key factors that should be taken into consideration when choosing a specific Region.</p>
			<p>We also looked at the concept of AZs, which enable you to build your solutions that offer high availability, fault-tolerance, and scalability options. Understanding which services are classified as global or regional is also critically important to your design architecture.</p>
			<p>We then looked at edge locations and their importance in the overall design of your cloud-application solutions. Edge locations and regional edge caches enable you to make your web applications' content and digital assets available to customers on a global scale via low-latency and high-speed network links. This is achieved by caching frequently accessed content locally at edge locations closer to the end users, substantially improving the UX in accessing that content.</p>
			<p>Next, we examined the four different AWS support plans available and discussed the key differences between them. Choosing the right support plan is vital to ensure that you get technical assistance when you need it most, depending on your specific use case. Furthermore, understanding the offering of each plan will allow you to decide how much support is going to cost your organization, enabling you to budget accordingly.</p>
			<p>Finally, we also examined the benefits offered by the PHD service—a vital tool to receive notifications and alerts of any AWS service outage or planned maintenance task that is likely to affect your workloads and applications. This will enable you to make proactive decisions as and when required.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to access the vast array of AWS services using an AWS account. An AWS account is required in order to consume its various services in a secure and isolated manner and it ensures that any workloads to deploy on AWS are not accessible to any other customers or entities—unless, of course, you grant such access.</p>
			<p>We also discuss multi-account strategies and why you might need to have more than one AWS account, as well as how to centrally manage multiple AWS accounts.</p>
			<p>Finally, we walk you through a step-by-step guide on creating your very first free AWS account.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we present a series of review questions to help you test your knowledge gained so far.</p>
