    c="60">! Platform engineering is the practice of creating environments that can
    build, test, validate, deploy, and operate software in a secure and cost-efficient
    way.</st> <st c="221">Platform engineering is about automation, and about enabling
    the platform’s users, developers, and operations to focus on value creation.</st>
    <st c="359">A platform, often defined as an</st> **<st c="391">Internal Development
    Platform</st>** <st c="420">or</st> **<st c="424">Internal Developer Portal</st>**
    <st c="449">(</st>**<st c="451">IDP</st>**<st c="454">), abstracts away the complexity
    of the underlying infrastructure and all the moving components required to support
    the software life cycle from its setup until it goes live in production.</st>
    <st c="644">But platform engineering is more than just technologies that have
    to play well together.</st> <st c="733">It requires an open mindset and a holistic
    approach to define the purpose of the platform, along with following principles
    in the decision-making process and fostering a culture of change</st> <st c="921">and
    innovation.</st>

    c="975">, we will engage you in building up a product mindset to build a solution
    that ages and matures with time but stays young at heart.</st> <st c="1107">Step
    by step, we will create our strategic direction and define our target architecture
    for the platform.</st> <st c="1213">This will become a living artifact for you
    and everyone working with you.</st> <st c="1287">Throughout the book, we will
    cover the four different pillars of a platform and the relevant decisions you
    have to take: the infrastructure representation by Kubernetes, the automation,
    the self-service capabilities, and the built-in observability and security.</st>
    <st c="1549">By the end, you will be equipped with tools to handle costs including
    actual infrastructure costs and technical debts.</st> <st c="1668">If both are
    managed well, they can even become your best allies in overcoming organizational
    obstacles</st> <st c="1771">and politics.</st>'

    provide additional sources that cover full technical details.</st> <st c="1911">Our
    goal is to provide you with a framework of references and an approach for defining
    platform architectures that can mature over time without being tied to a specific
    technology or version.</st> <st c="2103">We are well aware that the only constant
    in life is change, and this holds true for platform engineering.</st> <st c="2209">That’s
    why we also encourage you as a platform engineer and architect to keep up to date
    with those changes and bring the product mindset to your users</st> <st c="2361">and
    stakeholders.</st>
