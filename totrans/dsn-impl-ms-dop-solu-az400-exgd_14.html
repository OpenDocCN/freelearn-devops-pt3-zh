<h1 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor1117"/>Adopting the Culture of Continuous Improvement </h1>
<p>DevOps strategies deployed by teams mostly revolve around following a prescribed set of practices continuously and repeatedly as a part of every release iteration. However, high-performance teams approach everything with a learning mindset and identify improvements along the way to establish better discipline and becomes masters in doing things, such as effective <strong class="bold">continuous integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>)/<strong class="bold">continuous deployment</strong> (<strong class="bold">CD</strong>) practices for release agility, monitoring deployments to reduce failures, and addressing production issues in a timely manner. </p>
<p>No team can claim to be perfect in their implementation of DevOps practices. A culture of continuous learning must be inculcated as a must-have for the teams. Hence, listening to feedback coming from various stakeholders is the first step toward improving your DevOps hygiene. </p>
<p>Additionally, most DevOps tool vendors, including Microsoft, will periodically bring in newer enhancements and product innovations to the marketplace. Teams must constantly evaluate and plan to adopt these latest product features to maximize productivity. Adopting a culture of continuous improvement is critical to staying relevant in your DevOps journey.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the concept of <strong class="bold">continuous improvement</strong> and discusses a few of the approaches that organizations can make use of to learn constantly.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring your DevOps success</li>
<li>Value stream mapping</li>
<li>A data-driven approach</li>
<li>Operationalizing a feedback loop </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor1118"/>Measuring your DevOps success</h1>
<p>As discussed in <a href="B18655_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to DevOps</em>, defining effective metrics and measuring your results<a id="_idIndexMarker1186"/> against them is key to ensuring the success of your DevOps investments. This also serves as a compelling force to diligently follow the DevOps practices and improve them over time.</p>
<p>The insights derived from these<a id="_idIndexMarker1187"/> metrics act as a motivator for engineering teams to pay greater attention to where they are lacking. Let’s consider a few examples to illustrate this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery cycle metrics such as story points delivered per sprint, overall productivity, and the number of defects delivered per line of code give insights to project administrators on progress made during a sprint and the quality of the output.</li>
<li>Automated testing-related metrics such as test pass percentage, code coverage, and open defects offer insights into the readiness of the software before being released and deployed to production.</li>
<li>After the software has been released, reports around usage and user activity, health monitoring metrics, and a count of errors indicate the adoption of your software. </li>
</ul>
<p>From the examples shared, it is evident that dashboards and metrics have a strong bearing on the culture of a team and the habits it inculcates to achieve broader business objectives. </p>
<p>It is important to break down the <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>) into smaller and more meaningful<a id="_idIndexMarker1188"/> metrics. A few examples have been listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>KPI – lead time:<ul><li>Metrics: Sprint velocity, defects status by severity, static code analysis results, and so on </li></ul></li>
<li>KPI – deployment frequency:<ul><li>Metrics: Test case coverage, a unit test pass/fail rate, percentage build automation, the number of build pipelines, and the overall time for deployment</li></ul></li>
<li>KPI – mean time to restore a service<ul><li>Metrics: The incident resolution time, a count of alerts per day, the service response time, and so on</li></ul></li>
<li>KPI – change failure percentage<ul><li>Metrics: Server<a id="_idIndexMarker1189"/> exceptions, a count of incidents by severity, and so on</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we can conclude that the greater the number of DevOps metrics that you plan to measure, the more significant potential and benefit you will observe in the transformation of your DevOps practices. </p>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss the concept of value stream mapping as it applies to minimizing wastages in your DevOps life cycle.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-339"><a id="_idTextAnchor1119"/>Value stream mapping </h1>
<p><strong class="bold">Value stream mapping</strong> (<strong class="bold">VSM</strong>) is a concept that is quite popular in the<a id="_idIndexMarker1190"/> manufacturing industry. It refers to the technique of creating a lean process, having very minimal steps to produce a product for the customer. This is an important approach to improve any business workflow or process, thereby eliminating waste and redundant steps that don’t add any value, especially when viewed from a customer’s perspective. </p>
<p>The main objective of VSM is to critically analyze any given process and reduce the number of handoffs required between different team members, thereby improving the overall efficiency and productivity. With greater emphasis on digital transformation journeys, organizations are reinventing their business strategy, with a rapid realignment of any existing business/IT processes. The overall goal is to realign, if necessary, the definition of <em class="italic">delivered value</em> for customers.</p>
<p>In the context of a DevOps life cycle, it may be considered as identifying a lean methodology, comprising only the steps that are necessary to produce value for the customer. The DevOps value stream serves as an optimization driver, thereby impacting people, processes, and products. The primary motivation is to minimize wastage while continuously delivering customer value. </p>
<p>The visualization of how work flows across<a id="_idIndexMarker1191"/> the various stages of the development life cycle, from product ideation, feature prioritization, and developing a solution to the eventual release to the customer, is called the value stream map.</p>
<p>VSM-related activities comprise three major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, a baseline of the current as-is state is prepared. </li>
<li>Second, the target future state is defined, and the processes are redesigned by analyzing gaps or improvement areas.</li>
<li>Lastly, the gains from the VSM are analyzed to further iterate on this.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two main KPIs<a id="_idIndexMarker1192"/> that are impacted by VSM activities are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Lead time</strong> (<strong class="bold">LT</strong>), also referred to as throughput<a id="_idIndexMarker1193"/> time, response time, and turnaround time. Basically, this refers to elapsed time from the moment work is made available as an input to any particular stage of the value stream, until the time it is finished and delivered to the next stage or team in the value stream. </li>
<li><strong class="bold">Process time</strong> (<strong class="bold">PT</strong>), also referred to as processing<a id="_idIndexMarker1194"/> time, touch time, work time, and task time. Basically, this is the time it takes a person to complete all the tasks as part of a process to transform an input into an output for one unit of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next section, we will look at how management teams can significantly benefit from data-driven DevOps by narrowing their focus on areas that require the most attention.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-340"><a id="_idTextAnchor1120"/>A data-driven approach</h1>
<p>Deriving strategies for improvement<a id="_idIndexMarker1196"/> through a data-driven approach has proven to be successful for most organizations. There is tremendous potential to improve your CI/CD processes and speed up the delivery and quality of software by adopting a data-driven culture. Most high-performance engineering teams gain insights from the numerous dashboards and KPIs being tracked. They make use of the insights to identify improvement areas and change themselves accordingly.</p>
<p>Let us look at some of the key aspects<a id="_idIndexMarker1197"/> of data-driven DevOps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Objectively measure what matters</strong>: It all starts with identifying the important metrics and KPIs that must be tracked, and all measurements should be quantitative over qualitative. There is a saying that facts and figures don’t lie. The measurement items must be expanded to derive concrete actionable items. </li>
<li><strong class="bold">Report against benchmarks</strong>: The reporting tools that you use must consistently produce reports for the consumption of the various stakeholders. There must be some initial benchmarks defined, and the reports should track variance against them. Any deviations must be highlighted for action. </li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting and subsequent analysis must be a periodic activity (every week at a minimum, if not daily) to make course corrections as early as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Automate data delivery for immediate actions</strong>: It is important to get data in a timely fashion to take corrective actions. Hence, we must rely on any existing automation available or explore additional opportunities to improve data capture and notification processes. Most of the DevOps tools today have rich automation capabilities, making it easier for decision making. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, when a <strong class="bold">pull request</strong> (<strong class="bold">PR</strong>) is submitted, a build run checks <a id="_idIndexMarker1198"/>the quality of the changes and can immediately send out an email to a developer if there were any automated test run failures. Thus, the developer can fix the issue and resubmit their changes, instead of waiting for hours for the full results to become available.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Develop insights for decision makers</strong>: Measuring the success of your data-driven DevOps processes<a id="_idIndexMarker1199"/> is important for any organization. There are typically two focus areas – first, the KPIs that give insights about the health of your engineering life cycle, and second, the main DevOps maturity index metrics that serve as feedback for the leadership team. </li>
</ul>
<p>Teams must also conduct periodic reviews and analyses of data to identify opportunities for<a id="_idIndexMarker1200"/> improvement. The use of techniques such as <strong class="bold">Casual Analysis and Resolution</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAR</strong>) and <strong class="bold">fishbone analysis</strong> can help teams identify <a id="_idIndexMarker1201"/>the root source of issues and then act appropriately. You will find useful resources to discover more on these topics in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section at the end. </p>
<p>In the next section, we will explore how feedback loops can help in continuous improvement.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-341"><a id="_idTextAnchor1121"/>Operationalizing the feedback loop </h1>
<p>The concept<a id="_idIndexMarker1202"/> of feedback loops originated in <strong class="bold">systems thinking</strong>. Every organization can be modeled as a system, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1203"/> refers to an interconnected ecosystem of people, processes, and tools that operates in an organized cohesive manner to achieve business objectives or outcomes. Feedback is an important concept in systems thinking, wherein the stimuli help to control the output of the system.</p>
<p>If you are new to the term <em class="italic">feedback loops</em>, imagine it as an interconnected relationship between entities or processes wherein a change in one leads to a change in the second, which eventually leads to change in the first. It is like a cause-effect sequence, where data produced as an outcome of an event or activity is used to regulate the outcome by controlling the original input action. A simplified view of feedback loops is depicted here:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer184">
<img alt="Figure 14.1 – A simple feedback loop " height="562" src="image/B18655_14_01.jpg" width="1033"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.1 – A simple feedback loop</p>
<p>The DevOps processes<a id="_idIndexMarker1204"/> within an organization can be subjected to systems thinking analysis by identifying the appropriate feedback loops aligned with the goal of continuous improvement. There are two types of feedback loops:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Reinforcing feedback loop</strong>: A positive change or increase in the output<a id="_idIndexMarker1205"/> of the first entity causes<a id="_idIndexMarker1206"/> an increase in the second entity (positive feedback), which eventually leads to a greater increase in the first entity. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, as the productivity of the team improves, the overall velocity increases. However, there is a stretch limit beyond which the quality may be impacted. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Stabilizing/balancing feedback loop</strong>: A positive change or increase in the output of the first entity<a id="_idIndexMarker1207"/> serves as a signal to decrease<a id="_idIndexMarker1208"/> the second entity (negative feedback), which eventually leads to an adjustment in the output of the first entity, forcing it back into a balanced state again.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, as the team focuses on more quality-related checks as part of CI/CD processes, this adds up to the overall build time, thereby reducing the agility of the releases. Hence, teams are subsequently forced to optimize steps so that release agility can be brought back to an optimum state.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will look at the importance of designing effective feedback loops.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-342"><a id="_idTextAnchor1122"/>Implementing effective feedback loops</h2>
<p>From the examples studied<a id="_idIndexMarker1209"/> earlier, it is evident that not all feedback loops are important. Hence, it is crucial for organizations to design more effective feedback loops, and amplify the correct ones to achieve the right balance and trade-off between delivery agility, product quality, and the speed of releasing software to market. A few recommendations as initial<a id="_idIndexMarker1210"/> guidance are shared here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that automated notifications are acted upon in a timely manner. Conduct periodic root cause analysis to reduce their occurrences. </li>
<li>Make use of a VSM technique to uncover any redundant feedback loops that don’t add any value. </li>
<li>Achieve the right balance in your feedback systems between stability and positive change. Often, stability is more important than speed. </li>
<li>Involve key stakeholders to participate as part of the feedback loops. Human interaction can offer more practical and contextual guidance that may be beneficial for your team.</li>
<li>Make use of operational telemetry and metrics to serve as crucial feedback to improve your DevOps practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a popular saying that a one-size-fits-all approach<a id="_idIndexMarker1211"/> will never work in any context. Hence, careful planning is required to identify the feedback loops that are important for your organization and team context.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-343"><a id="_idTextAnchor1123"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we have reviewed a few of the important techniques to foster a journey of continuous improvement. To reap the true benefits of DevOps, organizations are expected to operate at the highest level of maturity. However, this is rarely the case, owing to numerous factors that are sometimes beyond anyone’s control. Hence, by establishing a culture of continuous improvement, teams can ensure that processes, methods, and practices are as efficient and effective as possible. </p>
<p>Adhering to a systematic and structured approach to continuous improvement might turn out to be quite beneficial for the teams. This requires an organizational commitment to continuous learning and openness of the teams to scrutinize and suggest incremental improvements. There must be dedicated roles appointed to define, plan, and monitor the continuous improvement initiatives. </p>
<p>Also, periodic training must be planned for all personnel on DevOps-related topics, acting as a source of stimuli for the self-directed teams so that they stay committed to the organization’s DevOps improvement. Team culture is fundamental to achieving engineering excellence through the demonstration of expertise in the various DevOps practices.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we shall explore how organizations can expedite their cloud transformation journeys through DevOps.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-344"><a id="_idTextAnchor1124"/>Activity</h1>
<ul>
<li>Organize your team and conduct a brainstorming session, preferably using a whiteboard tool.</li>
<li>Create three vertical swim lanes – <strong class="bold">Retain</strong>, <strong class="bold">Improve</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Discard</strong>.</li>
<li>Using sticky notes, advise your team to publish their thoughts on the whiteboard. Basically, identify an existing process and group them in the appropriate swim lane. </li>
<li>Critically analyze the items grouped as Discard, and then verify whether they add any value while achieving the overall objectives of quality and efficiency, especially from a customer’s point of view. </li>
<li>Also, identify improvement areas for the existing processes by either simplifying them altogether or changing them.</li>
<li>Publish a summary of your findings with the management team. </li>
</ul>
