			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Chapter 4</em>: Rebranding Yourself</h1>
			<p>You are continuously learning, growing, and becoming a better version of yourself. Those who see you on a frequent basis know exactly who you are and what skills you possess; however, to the rest of the world you are defined by your social profiles. In this chapter, we will guide you through how to ensure your social profiles, resume, and personal web pages match who you have become and what you want to accomplish. We will start by refreshing your social profiles, then work on your other online sites, such as GitLab and GitHub, and end with ensuring your resume matches your social profiles.</p>
			<p>We will cover the following main topics in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ways of improving your LinkedIn profile</li>
				<li>Updating your resume to match the career you are after</li>
				<li>Updating or creating your personal web page</li>
				<li>Leveraging Twitter and other social profiles</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Ways of improving your LinkedIn profile</h1>
			<p>Your social profiles are seen by everyone, and recruiters are continuously looking at them. An updated <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>and maintained <strong class="bold">LinkedIn</strong> profile is the easiest <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>way to get noticed by recruiters and hiring managers. In this section, we'll cover all the changes needed to ensure your LinkedIn profile represents you best and is seen by more people.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Updating your headline</h2>
			<p>Your headline <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>is highly visible to others on LinkedIn. By default, it displays your job title and where you work. Be creative, use it to show off your top skills, advertise your job search, or use a unique tagline to ensure your profile stands out from everyone else. </p>
			<p>If you are an experienced DevOps engineer looking for a career change, you could try the following headline: </p>
			<p><em class="italic">DevOps | Cloud | Containers | Open to Remote Opportunities</em></p>
			<p>If you are not looking for a new career but want to stand out, try the following headline:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Experienced Cloud Engineer | AWS | GCP | AZURE</em></p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>are two fictitious individuals who have bland and boring headlines on the left with bold and refreshing headlines on the right:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer063" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.1_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – LinkedIn headline refresh&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – LinkedIn headline refresh</p>
			<p> Your headline can be up to 220 characters and should describe what you are skilled at and why people should be interested in you. Having keywords, such as <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong>, <strong class="bold">Cloud</strong>, and <strong class="bold">AWS</strong>, will increase the number of search results you appear in on LinkedIn. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we will discuss why recommendations are important and how to ask for them. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Recommendations</h2>
			<p>LinkedIn can request recommendations from colleagues and managers you have worked <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>with, and then display them on your profile. This allows individuals who visit your profile to see recommendations from individuals who have worked with you before they even interview you. Here are a number of tips when asking for recommendations: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Recommendations should come from people you have a good relationship with, preferably, someone you can ask to recommend you prior to sending the request on LinkedIn. </li>
				<li>Recommendations should come from people you respect and whose work is respected in the industry you are in.</li>
				<li>If you are a more senior DevOps professional, recommendations should come from individuals you have mentored, other senior DevOp peers, or a director or VP, if you have a close working relationship.</li>
				<li>Do not request a recommendation from someone you have not spoken with for an extended period or someone you parted with on bad terms.</li>
				<li>Recommendations from professors you are close with are immensely powerful.</li>
				<li>Do not request a recommendation from another junior DevOps engineer or individual who is also looking for their first role in the profession. Instead, ask your mentor (if you have one) for a recommendation. The importance of mentorship will be covered in <a href="B18117_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor151"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mentorship</em>. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you receive a recommendation and are not satisfied with how it looks, it is OK to ask for it to be revised. Make sure to provide specific feedback and the reasons for requesting the change. A poorly written recommendation can do more harm than good. The following is an example of a poorly written recommendation:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer064" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.2_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – An incomplete and vague recommendation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – An incomplete and vague recommendation</p>
			<p>The problem <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>with the preceding recommendation is the poor grammar and lack of detail; what tasks is John good at, and why? If I saw this recommendation, I would be very curious; it came from a highly credible person but lacks any meaningful details. The following is the same recommendation with better grammar and more detail: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer065" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.3_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – A well-written recommendation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – A well-written recommendation</p>
			<p>To summarize this section, recommendations are important and can help you land a job when they come from a respected individual and are written well. In the next section, we will discuss the sections that you should include in your LinkedIn profile but might not. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Additional sections </h2>
			<p>There are profile sections within LinkedIn that you may not have taken the time to update <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>or do not even know are available. LinkedIn does not have the same single-page constraint that a resume does; if you have information that may increase your chances of landing a job, include it. </p>
			<h3>Featured content </h3>
			<p>The Featured Content section is near the top of the page and allows you to add articles <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>you have published, projects you have worked on, as well as your personal website(s). This should be a highlight of career accomplishments that can be shared publicly. A wonderful thing about the featured content section is it can easily be populated with items in the Accomplishments section, which we will cover next.</p>
			<h3>Accomplishments </h3>
			<p>Accomplishments <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>are often forgotten about. The Accomplishments section can be used to add publications, patents, courses, projects, honors and awards, test scores, organizations, and causes. The Accomplishments section information can be added as featured content and displayed at the top of your page.</p>
			<h3>Experience </h3>
			<p>The Experience section is usually updated directly on LinkedIn by the individual who owns <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>the profile; however, the details describing each experience are often lacking, especially if you have been in a role for an extended period. A good rule is to update your Experience section each time you finish working on a project or initiative. If you are looking for your first role as a DevOps engineer, try to highlight the experiences from your past roles that would apply to a role as a DevOps engineer. </p>
			<h3>Profile picture </h3>
			<p>Updating <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>your profile photo is not necessary to get a job or be recognized; however, it will not hurt. The same person who takes your family photos or pictures of your pet could capture a headshot for you to use on your profile. Profiles that have a profile picture are ranked higher in the search algorithm, resulting in more recruiters and hiring managers seeing your profile.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will discuss the power of skill endorsements, as well as skill exams.</p>
			<h3>Skill endorsements</h3>
			<p>Skill endorsements <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>can be added by you and validated by any of your first-degree connections. The more individuals who validate you for a job, the higher the likelihood you will be found when someone searches for the skill. If you are looking for a job as a DevOps engineer, getting endorsed for skills such as AWS, Python, and DevOps can help you get noticed. To further increase the likelihood of being found based on a specific skill, you can take skill assessments.</p>
			<p>LinkedIn skill assessments are professionally written exams that you can take for specific skills; when passed, you receive a badge on your profile telling everyone you have passed the skills assessment. This endorsement again raises your rank in the search algorithm and increases your chances of being noticed by recruiters. The final thing we will discuss is interacting with other professionals within your industry. </p>
			<h3>Share, like, and comment</h3>
			<p>Interacting <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>with other DevOps professionals has proven to be the most powerful means of connecting and building relationships on LinkedIn for me. In <a href="B18117_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Building Your Network, </em>we will cover strategies to help build relationships on LinkedIn. Every time you share, like, or comment on content, the likelihood of you getting noticed or showing up in a potential employer's feed increases. </p>
			<p>In this section, we went through strategies to help increase the likelihood of being noticed on LinkedIn; in the next portion of this chapter, we will go through strategies for ensuring your resume is ready to present to hiring managers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Updating your resume to match the career you are after</h1>
			<p>Even if you are not actively looking for a job, it is good practice to have an updated copy of your <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>resume ready to dispense, as the perfect opportunity can come about at any time. In this section, we cover tips to improve your resume, which will lead to more callbacks and, hopefully, interviews. </p>
			<p>Regardless of how skilled you are or how much experience you have, your resume should fit on a single page. If Elon Musk can fit his experience on one page (<a href="https://novoresume.com/career-blog/elon-musk-one-page-resume">https://novoresume.com/career-blog/elon-musk-one-page-resume</a>), so can you. The purpose of a resume is to allow recruiters and hiring managers to gain a quick picture of a candidate in under a minute. Some companies implement a computerized layer in the process that scans your resume for keywords and verifies requirements prior to it being passed along to a human. Let's look at what should be included in the six sections of a resume, starting with contact information.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Contact information</h2>
			<p>Contact information <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>should include at a minimum your name as it appears on your online profiles, email address, and phone number. Including your location and personal profile information is recommended, especially if you have just updated it. You are not encouraged to include a photo in your resume, as recruiters believe this can add bias to the selection process. The next piece of vital information is your objective. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Objective</h2>
			<p>This is the section that describes what you have to offer, and what type of position you are <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>hoping to land. The objective is short and concise, no more than a sentence or two. Depending on your preferences, you can write a general objective, such as the following:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">DevOps leader with 20 years of experience specializing in cloud-native security, and Kubernetes. Looking to join a fast-paced organization with a strong engineering culture.</em></p>
			<p>One thing to notice about the preceding objective is the overuse of keywords to put emphasis on the skills you bring to the role you are searching for. The alternative to this is an objective targeting a specific position, such as the following example:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">DevOps leader with 20 years of experience specializing in CICD, security, and Kubernetes, looking to join company xyz as a Lead DevOps Engineer.</em></p>
			<p>The latter approach is a better option as it allows you to cherry-pick keywords to include, as well as to make it more personal by using the exact job title and company name. On the <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>other hand, you may want to bulk apply to as many jobs as you can; in those cases, you should always have an updated resume with a general objective you can use. A keynote about the objective is it should include keywords that you want to be noticed, both by an automated checker and a human. In the preceding example, we used several keywords, including years of experience. Next, we will discuss the largest portion of your resume: your work experience. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Experience</h2>
			<p>Experience should be listed in reverse chronological order, with your most recent at the top of <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>the section. Each position listed should include five key pieces of information: <strong class="bold">position</strong>, <strong class="bold">employer</strong>, <strong class="bold">start date</strong>, <strong class="bold">end date</strong>, and <strong class="bold">accomplishments</strong>. All information should be as accurate as possible. Always assume your information will be verified; even an honest mistake could cost you a job. Accomplishments should be specific and contain quantifiable data. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Worked with application teams to significantly increase availability for customer-facing applications</em></p>
			<p>The preceding example is a friendly conversation starter; however, it will annoy a recruiter or hiring manager as it lacks clarity and leaves the reader wondering what was accomplished. A single poorly written accomplishment could get your resume put in the rejection pile if you are applying for a highly competitive job. A better way to write this would be as follows:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Implemented geographic redundancy and automatic failovers in AWS for app x, which resulted in application availability increasing from 98.7% to 99.9%.</em></p>
			<p>The preceding example gives clarity and specific details about what was accomplished. This type of detail gets your resume moved to the interview pile instead of the rejection pile.</p>
			<p>A common challenge for new DevOps engineers is that they lack experience. Not to worry, you just need to document the experiences that have prepared you for your first role as a DevOps engineer. If your current position is as a software engineer, make sure you focus on the accomplishments that are relevant for a role in DevOps by focusing on the relevant tools and principles. Something like the following would fit well:</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Software Engineer | Company XYZ | May 2020 - Present</p>
			<p class="callout">Integrated the end-to-end testing framework, Test Café, into Jenkins CI pipeline, resulting in a 30% reduction in time team spend testing locally.</p>
			<p class="callout">Worked on APIs utilizing AWS services, which currently serve over 20,000 requests per month. </p>
			<p class="callout">Contributed my Test Café method to the Jenkins Global Pipeline Library inner source project so other teams could leverage it.</p>
			<p>My advice for <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>readers is this: experiences included on your resume do not need to be paid roles. If you are a main contributor to an open source project, include that in your experience section, especially if you are early in your career. This will get you noticed and land you an interview. A common misconception is that unpaid experience and volunteer work should only be brought up during an interview.</p>
			<p>Next, we will cover both the Skills and Certifications sections.</p>
			<h3>Skills and Certifications</h3>
			<p>Your skills <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>and certifications should be a copy of what can be found on your LinkedIn profile; you have less space, so choose your most relevant skills and certifications to include. In <em class="italic">Figure 4.4</em>, bar diagrams are used to represent my competency. One thing known to raise questions is when your resume shows top skills that do not reflect the story your experience tells. Saying AWS is a top skill when none of your accomplishments for previous roles reflect that is a red flag for recruiters and hiring managers. If your experience with AWS has come from a large side project you have worked on, you need to include the project on your resume.</p>
			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>I really started to feel old while researching this topic. A four-year degree used to be a requirement to get into a software engineering/IT-related role. As you progressed in your career, it became less and less important until it was a non-topic, unless you were looking <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>to move into a leadership role that required a master's degree. Now, for a lot of individuals, it started out as a non-topic because they were self-taught, or went through a coding boot camp and gained real-world experience through internships. This is a step in the right direction. As a hiring manager, I am less concerned that you have a four-year degree and more concerned that you have a mindset of continual learning. </p>
			<p>Any education you have should be listed on your resume; some roles have minimum education requirements that you will be automatically disqualified from if they are not found on your resume. In <a href="B18117_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Building Your Network</em>, we will discuss how it is possible to bypass this requirement by networking with the correct people.</p>
			<p>At this point, we have covered the required sections of a resume. The following is an example that visually demonstrates the various sections:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer066" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.4_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 – A resume example&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4 – A resume example</p>
			<p> The following <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>are two sites that can help you <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>create <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>amazing-looking single-page resumes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Novorésumé: <a href="https://novoresume.com/&#13;">https://novoresume.com/</a></li>
				<li>Resume.io: <a href="https://resume.io/&#13;">https://resume.io/</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next section, we will discuss the importance of a personal web page and how to create one. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Updating and or creating your personal web page</h1>
			<p>Your personal <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>web page should be an extension of your <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>resume and LinkedIn profile, a place where you can expand on topics you are passionate about and projects you are interested in. The web page should allow you to discuss and divulge your personal interests and hobbies to humanize yourself to potential employers. If you already have a personal web page, you can skip the next how-to section on creating one using GitLab Pages.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>GitLab Pages tutorial</h2>
			<p>Creating a static <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>web page has become a simple task that costs no money, and not a whole lot of time. Both GitHub and GitLab offer free static site hosting. In this section, we will go through how to create a site using GitLab Pages.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Prerequisites</strong>: You need <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>to be registered with a free account on GitLab.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first thing we are going to do is install <strong class="source-inline">hexo</strong>, a node-based website framework:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">npm install -g hexo</strong></p></li>
				<li>Next, log in to GitLab (<a href="https://gitlab.com/">https://gitlab.com/</a>) and navigate to <a href="https://gitlab.com/natejswenson/dcr-demo">https://gitlab.com/natejswenson/dcr-demo</a>. Fork <strong class="source-inline">dcr-demo</strong> into your workspace. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Clone the repository you forked onto your local machine, <strong class="source-inline">cd</strong> (change directly), into the project folder directly, and run the following commands:</p>
			<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">npm install </strong></p>
			<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">hexo server</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Open a browser and navigate to <strong class="source-inline">localhost:4000</strong> to view the current site.</li>
				<li>Make changes to personalize the site to make it your own and then push it back to GitLab:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">git stage . </strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">git commit -m "my commit"</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">git push</strong></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Navigate back to GitLab to the project you just pushed, and click on <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Pages</strong> to view the URL where your site is published. </p>
			<p>If you followed <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>along, you have installed the necessary modules onto your local machine to do development using the Hexo framework, forked a repository into your user space, cloned the repository to your local machine, made changes, and pushed the changes back to GitLab where your site is published. Nice work. In the next portion of this section, you will be given the minimum information that should be included on your personal web page. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Sections to include on your personal web page</h2>
			<p>Development <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>has always been easy; creating content on the other hand is a struggle. The following are what I have found to be effective sections on a personal web page. </p>
			<h3>Contact</h3>
			<p>The contact <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>section should include your email, LinkedIn, GitLab, GitHub, and any other professional profile you want individuals visiting your site to be aware of.</p>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Introduce <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>yourself to potential employers, both professionally and personally. This is your chance to describe who you are at work and outside of work, as well as to express your passion for the field of DevOps.</p>
			<h3>Blog</h3>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>section is optional; if you enjoy writing it should be included, as your writing will be of interest to potential employers. If you are not a writer, do not start blogging just to have it on your web page. I did this, and it was not fun for me or my readers; I was not passionate about what I was writing about, so it was not my best work. In this case, my time was better spent working on some Alexa Skills and adding those to my website.</p>
			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>is another opportunity to show potential employers your interests and what you spend your time doing outside of work. A few examples include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>GitHub projects</li>
				<li>GitLab projects</li>
				<li>Smart device skills</li>
				<li>Custom home automation </li>
				<li>School projects (especially Capstone)</li>
				<li>Speaking events</li>
				<li>Presentations you have given</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Resume</h3>
			<p>Your resume should be visually displayed or downloadable from your site as a PDF. This <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>reduces the back and forth between you and interested parties. </p>
			<p>In summary, your personal website is an extension of your LinkedIn profile but allows you to add your own branding to it. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Leveraging Twitter and other social profiles</h1>
			<p>Whether you are a social influencer of technology, or a college student hoping to land an internship, it is beneficial to have a social presence that spans several platforms. In previous <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>sections, we covered how to set up your LinkedIn page in such a way that you will get noticed by recruiters, as well as how to get started with your own web page. In this section, we will take this a step further and discuss how you can supplement your LinkedIn and personal web page by posting on Twitter or writing articles for Medium.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer067" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.5_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5 – Social profiles&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5 – Social profiles</p>
			<p>We will start by discussing Twitter and how you can leverage it to get a job as a DevOps engineer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Twitter </h2>
			<p>Twitter use <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>for technology professionals falls into two categories: consuming information and sharing information. </p>
			<h3>Twitter for consuming information</h3>
			<p>Twitter is <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>a wonderful place if you are looking to stay current on the bleeding edge of technology announcements. On Twitter, you can follow individuals such as Gene Kim or Martin Fowler, as seen in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer068" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.6_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – Gene Kim and Martin Fowler on Twitter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6 – Gene Kim and Martin Fowler on Twitter</p>
			<p>On Twitter, you can also follow news outlets and companies, such as Stack Overflow or ZDNet, as seen in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer069" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.7_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7 – Stack Overflow and ZDNet on Twitter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7 – Stack Overflow and ZDNet on Twitter</p>
			<p>Another use <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>of Twitter is for sharing information with your followers.</p>
			<h3>Twitter for sharing information</h3>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>become a fan of Twitter and enjoy using it, you may want to try and increase your followers. An effective way to do this is by sharing original content or sharing content posted by someone else.</p>
			<p>If you become a popular and highly followed account on Twitter, you'll be more likely to get noticed by recruiters and individuals who are hiring. </p>
			<p>Twitter does have a limitation of posts, or tweets, having a length of no longer than 280 characters. If you need a forum that allows for more information, you may want to consider Medium.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Medium</h2>
			<p>Medium, according <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>to <a href="https://medium.com/">https://medium.com/</a>, is an open platform <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>where readers find dynamic thinking, and where expert and undiscovered voices can share their writing on any topic. Medium is a wonderful place to start your career as a writer, as anyone can write for it.</p>
			<p>The key to finding success on Medium is building views of your article. This can be done by cross-posting your Medium article on other social sites, such as LinkedIn and Twitter. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer070" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.8_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 4.8 – Using Medium and other social sites&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8 – Using Medium and other social sites</p>
			<p>In the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>diagram, you have just written and posted an article on Medium but have struggled to get people to click on and read your article. You decide to post your Medium article on your LinkedIn and Twitter profiles. This results in getting additional clicks for your Medium article. You also begin to receive messages from recruiters and others congratulating you on your article.</p>
			<p>There are many other social media sites that can further help you grow your online presence, which will increase your chances of connecting with individuals who can help you land a job. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Summary </h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered all the necessary changes you need to make to ensure you are presenting your best self to potential employers. We discussed the importance of having a complete and professionally written LinkedIn profile, as well as giving suggestions on how to improve the likelihood of being noticed by potential employers. Next, we covered how to update your resume in such a way that essential information is seen quickly, both by automated systems and humans. We then covered the importance of having a personal web page, went through a tutorial on how to create a Hexo web page on GitLab, and the sections that should be included in your personal web page. Finally, we covered other social sites, which are not required but can increase the likelihood of getting noticed by recruiters. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss the importance of networking, and how to do it on LinkedIn and at conferences. </p>
