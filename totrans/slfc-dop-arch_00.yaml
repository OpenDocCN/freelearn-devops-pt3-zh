- en: This book starts by cultivating a DevOps mindset, focusing on collaboration,
    coordination, and communication. It helps you learn how to efficiently demonstrate
    governance, visibility, and accountability. Building upon this architectural foundation,
    you’ll delve into tools and techniques to plan your strategy using the capabilities
    of SFDX. Once you’ve gotten to grips with Salesforce packaging, you’ll learn how
    to build a CI/CD stack with freely available software and configure it for automated
    change delivery. You’ll then address the operational concerns of a mature DevOps
    process as you explore topics such as ticket management, backups, change monitoring,
    and data seeding. These are essential for maintaining a clean and healthy Salesforce
    org. Finally, you’ll learn about the ecosystem of third-party solutions, which
    provide out-of-the-box capabilities to accelerate your Salesforce DevOps journey.
