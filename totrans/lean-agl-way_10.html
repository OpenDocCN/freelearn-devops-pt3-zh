			<p class="author-quote">“In today’s data-driven world, success belongs to those who can transform information into insights, and insights into action.”</p>
			<p class="author-quote">- Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft</p>
			<p>Our digital age, with its vast oceans of data teeming with swirling currents of information, presents a challenging business voyage. Metaphorically, navigating these waters is about seizing opportunities and avoiding perils. Do we know our market position amid these vast expanses? Are we equipped with the right information to guide our destination? If not, what data is needed to make the proper <span class="No-Break">course corrections?</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we provide a map for a crucial journey toward organizational success, experienced differently by executives and employees. Executives operate at a strategic level, setting the course to guide the organization’s direction through competitive seas. Meanwhile, employees operate at a tactical level, managing daily operations to keep all systems functioning smoothly and efficiently. Both perspectives are essential, ensuring that every aspect of the organization’s value streams works together toward achieving <span class="No-Break">corporate goals.</span></p>
			<p>However, organizations face a unique paradox: while data is abundant, they often struggle to find the right data on demand to uncover actionable insights. The proliferation of data often obscures the insights needed to make timely and informed course adjustments. This chapter addresses this challenge by guiding you through methods to distill vast data into actionable, <span class="No-Break">relevant information.</span></p>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor452"/>By the end of the chapter, you’ll possess strategies to convert raw data into tangible insights that steer decisions, shaping the efficiency and trajectory of your organization’s <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn how these practices work together to deliver customer-centric value. The topics covered include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding data’s <span class="No-Break">true potential</span></li>
				<li>Organizing business objectives <span class="No-Break">with BRIA</span></li>
				<li>Facilitating informed decision-making <span class="No-Break">through QIDA</span></li>
				<li>Conducting BRIA workshops for <span class="No-Break">strategic alignment</span></li>
				<li>Leveraging AI-based tools to support <span class="No-Break">BRIA workshops</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor453"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>You do not need expertise in data management to grasp the concepts discussed in this chapter and to understand their role in specifying data and information requirements. However, <strong class="bold">Database Management System </strong>(<strong class="bold">DBMS</strong>) specialists<a id="_idIndexMarker766"/> are essential to implement these concepts within your organization’s business systems. DBMS specialists can look at the <em class="italic">Further reading </em>section at the end of the chapter for relevant books on data management from Packt. Finally, those who want to dive more deeply into the BRIA/QIDA concepts covered in this chapter should read the book <em class="italic">Climbing the Ladder of Business Intelligence </em>by James E. Cates, Sam S. Gill, and <span class="No-Break">Natalie Zeituny.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">1</span></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor454"/>Understanding data’s true potential</h1>
			<p>Navigating <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>today’s vast oceans of data can be overwhelming, whether you’re an IT expert charting the depths or a senior operational leader merely skimming the surface. In today’s data-rich world, IT leaders, practitioners, and those outside the tech domain face a shared challenge: knowing where to find the information they need when we need <span class="No-Break">it most.</span></p>
			<p>Whether you’re an information consumer or producer, you must understand how to distinguish the nuances between facts, data, and information. Recognizing the power of asking the right questions to sift through data to unearth high-value insights effectively becomes paramount. Grasping these principles equips you to collaboratively ensure that business strategies are data-informed, empowering you to contribute more significantly to your <span class="No-Break">organization’s success.</span></p>
			<p>As you progress through this chapter, you’ll grasp the dilemma: too much data can slow decision-making, while too little reduces the ability to make informed decisions. You’ll learn to curate and refine data by aligning it closely with specific business objectives and by focusing on <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>asking the right questions—emphasizing quality <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>over quantity through the <span class="No-Break">following </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker770"/></span><span class="No-Break">approaches:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business Role Intelligence Analysis</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">BRIA</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) process</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Question, Information, Decision, Action</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">QIDA</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) concept.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, let’s start this understanding by looking at current statistics highlighting this <span class="No-Break">challenge’s sc<a id="_idTextAnchor455"/>ope.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor456"/>Addressing Data challenges and opportunities</h2>
			<p>In our digital age, our <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>world is inundated with a seemingly endless stream of data. From<a id="_idIndexMarker772"/> clicks on a web page to real-time analytics spanning business and financial transactions, every second gives birth to vast amounts of data. This presents both an opportunity and a challenge: with such immense volumes of data at our fingertips, how do we unlock its <span class="No-Break">true potential?</span></p>
			<p>Zippia’s recent report reveals some <span class="No-Break">thought-provoking insights:</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">2</span></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A staggering 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are <span class="No-Break">produced daily</span></li>
				<li>Yet, companies only harness and analyze 37–40% of <span class="No-Break">their data</span></li>
				<li>Despite 97.2% of businesses heavily investing in big data and AI, an alarming 60–73% of data remains untouched <span class="No-Break">and unanalyzed</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These statistics underscore a paradox: there’s an overflow of data but a significant shortfall in its meaningful use. The vast seas of data remain largely uncharted for most organizations, concealing valuable insights beneath their depths. So, it should be obvious we need to start figuring out how to discover and use this data <span class="No-Break">most effectively.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor457"/>Charting a course for data utilization</h2>
			<p>At its core, data’s true<a id="_idIndexMarker773"/> potential is not in its volume but in its<a id="_idIndexMarker774"/> applicability. More explicitly, it’s about knowing which questions are pivotal to your organization’s success, and what data is necessary to answer those questions. Where can you locate the data? And how can you transform raw data into actionable insights that propel decision-making? Let’s break this process down into <span class="No-Break">three parts:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Refining data</strong>: Suppose your data was oil. The number of oil barrels is less important than the refining process’s quality and efficiency, which enable the oil to be converted into something of value, such as gasoline, diesel, or asphalt, and then distributed <span class="No-Break">to customers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Asking the right questions</strong>: Every strategic initiative should begin with the right questions. What do you need to know? These questions act as the compass pointing toward the data <span class="No-Break">that matters.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Knowledge management</strong>: Once you’ve identified the right questions, you must know where to find the answers. This involves diving into databases, discerning patterns, and distinguishing between relevant, irrelevant, and <span class="No-Break">redundant data.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Completing this <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>journey from question to actionable insight is the <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>essence of realizing data’s true potential. Organizations that stand out in this ever-evolving digital landscape will master this navigational skill, converting vast data into information that informs our business decisions and allows us to take appropriate actions. By continually refining the process, prioritizing the right questions, and effectively harnessing data, businesses can chart a course to their strategic objectives, ensuring that every decision is grounded in the most relevant, <span class="No-Break">actionable insights.</span></p>
			<p>As you move forward, remember that data is your ally – a tool that, when used aptly, can forge the path to sustained growth and innovation. So, now, let’s move on to understand how we transform raw data into <span class="No-Break">actionable insights.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor458"/>Transforming data into insights</h2>
			<p>Capturing and assessing <a id="_idIndexMarker777"/>data is merely the initial step in a larger journey. The<a id="_idIndexMarker778"/> real mastery emerges in its transformation – specifically, converting raw data into information-rich insights. Through a combination of analytical tools, methodologies, and, at times, intuitive judgment, one can sculpt this raw material into actionable insights, unlocking the profound potential that data holds for guiding decisions and <span class="No-Break">crafting strategies.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter invites you to see beyond the overwhelming expanse of data and focus on its essence. This means distinguishing between data that adds value versus data that overwhelms without a positive effect. For the aspiring professionals, it’s about ensuring that organizational strategies tap into the heart of data, extracting insights that align with and drive <span class="No-Break">business objectives.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding and harnessing the true potential of data is more than professional competency; it’s a game-changer. However, capturing and assessing data is merely the initial step in a more comprehensive journey. Transforming raw data into insights is achieved through a <a id="_idIndexMarker779"/>blend of analytical tools, methodologies, and, at<a id="_idIndexMarker780"/> times, <span class="No-Break">intui<a id="_idTextAnchor459"/>tive judgment.</span></p>
			<p>The concept of BRIA paves the way in the realm of business intelligence as a moniker for how we define information needs. The BRIA concept is simple. Data requirements are defined by the type of business or business domain in which we work and by our roles and responsibilities. Therefore, the business and roles affect the type of information we need to take appropriate and timely actions. </p>
			<p>As you make your way through this chapter, please refer to <span class="No-Break">Figure 10</span>.1, The BRIA Process. This roadmap will help your organization navigate the boundless oceans of data to uncover the insights needed to make informed, near real-time decisions and take more <span class="No-Break">effective actions.</span></p>

			<p>But BRIA is only part of an effective data management strategy. Its refined<a id="_idIndexMarker781"/> and subsequently extended counterpart, QIDA, takes <a id="_idIndexMarker782"/>BRIA a step further as we come to understand that it’s the questions we need to be able to answer that drive the decisions and actions we need to take. Also, we cannot forget that data requirements change by roles and responsibilities. So, together, the combined insights of BRIA and QIDA are implemented through the intelligent business model via BRIDAI tables and workshops. <strong class="bold">BRIDAI </strong>is the<a id="_idIndexMarker783"/> acronym for <strong class="bold">Business, Role, Information, Decision, Action, Impact</strong>. This acronym spells out the columns in the BRIDAI tables, shown later in <span class="No-Break">Figure 10</span>.2 - BRIDAI Table Elements and in the examples included in this <span class="No-Break">chapter's Appendix.</span></p>
			<p>As we delve deeper into this chapter, we will unpack and explore these interconnected processes and their profound implications for modern businesses. We’ll start by defining the concepts <span class="No-Break">behind BRIA.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor461"/>Organizing business objectives</h1>
			<p>Navigating the dynamic <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>business landscape, you’ll often find the need to align organizational endeavors with data-driven insights relevant to the role of the individual or organization. This section introduces the BRIA framework, a tailored approach designed to seamlessly connect your role’s tasks with the broader <span class="No-Break">business objectives.</span></p>
			<p>Specifically, we’ll focus on the structure and application of BRIA emphasizing how this methodology guides organizations to align their information needs with overarching business objectives. This alignment applies whether you operate in the C-Suite, in a managerial capacity, or directly within a <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<p>By embracing these insights, you’ll grasp not just the theoretical aspects but also the hands-on utility of the BRIA-based executive and value stream workshops. As you integrate these learnings, you’ll be better poised to shape and influence business strategies with clarity and confidence, ensuring that every step you take is rooted in <span class="No-Break">data-centric wisdom.</span></p>
			<p>In the next subsection, we will describe the BRIA process, outlined in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.1 </em>and originally described in the book <em class="italic">Climbing the Ladder of Business Intelligence </em>by James E. Cates, Sam S. Gill, and <span class="No-Break">Natalie Zeituny.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">1</span></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor462"/>Creating intelligent businesses</h2>
			<p>The essence of<a id="_idIndexMarker785"/> creating an <em class="italic">intelligent business </em>lies in its ability to ask – and, more importantly – answer intelligent questions. In other words, we apply critical thinking and inquiry in the context of business intelligence to answer the organization’s most challenging questions. Specifically, we implement  a systematic approach to transform data into actionable insights. These insights are also tailored to specific roles within an organization. This ensures that every decision-maker has the precise information they need. This intelligent business journey, known as BRIA, unfolds <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<p>Starting at the top of the list shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>, we pinpoint the organization’s core processes and value streams. These are the essential operations that keep the business running, forming the backbone of every other action and decision. Once these processes are crystal clear, the focus shifts to the key players – the roles that execute the information requests. Not all roles need an in-depth analysis, so it’s vital to discern which ones do – or at least start your BRIA assessments with the highest priority business domains and roles that have the most impact in decision making in your <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile organization.</span></p>
			<p>As always, at the value steam level, prioritize based on eliminating your constraints, lowering costs and improving quality. In contrast, sales and marketing will focus on identifying the right customers, their needs, and their journeys. And chief and LOB executives will prioritize the information they need to build and drive their strategies while ensuring compliance with legal and <span class="No-Break">financial constraints.</span></p>
			<p>Upon identifying these pivotal roles, they’re clearly defined by name and organization - for example, John in accounting, Mary in customer support, or Jose in fulfillment. But merely naming a role and business function isn’t enough. To truly empower each role, uncovering the burning questions they need answered to succeed in their responsibilities is essential. In other words, what do they need to know daily? What information can drive their decision-making to the <span class="No-Break">next level?</span></p>
			<p>These questions lead to the next phase: discerning the exact information to provide those answers. To get that information, you need reliable, high-quality data sources. Identifying these sources ensures that the derived information is accurate and relevant. Data often needs to be combined or changed to become useful information. This process, called data transformation, involves cleaning, checking, and preparing the data for <span class="No-Break">different uses.</span></p>
			<p>Yet, the quest doesn’t end at merely sourcing the right data. It’s equally crucial to understand the role’s scope of responsibilities. How frequently do they need this information? Is it a daily lookup or dashboard glance, a weekly report, or a <span class="No-Break">monthly analysis?</span></p>
			<p>Then comes the mode of presentation. In our technologically driven era, the medium can often influence the effectiveness of the message. Whether the information is channeled through an email, displayed on a mobile device, or integrated into an application, dashboard, or report, it has to suit the preferences and responsibilities of <span class="No-Break">the role.</span></p>
			<p>The next consideration circles back to the core processes identified at the outset. It’s about understanding how the role interacts with these processes. What are the inputs and outputs unique to this role concerning the core processes? Additionally, recognizing other business roles that intersect with the one being analyzed can provide a holistic view of the organization’s <span class="No-Break">data ecosystem.</span></p>
			<p>Lastly, and perhaps <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>most crucially, there’s a need to ascertain the current position of the role on the organizational structure and envision where it ideally should be. Think about this from a value stream perspective. If the person’s role was originally defined in a traditional hierarchical structure, but their responsibilities support a specific value stream, their focus and responsibilities will change. In turn, that knowledge aids in understanding potential changes in responsibilities and ensuring that the information needs evolve <span class="No-Break">in tandem.</span></p>
			<p>The BRIA process offers a proven roadmap to creating an intelligent business environment. For IT experts, it’s a window into the intricate dance of data and decisions, while for executives, it<a id="_idIndexMarker787"/> offers a strategic lens to seamlessly align data with <a id="_idTextAnchor463"/><span class="No-Break">business objectives.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you understand RIA’s foundational concepts, we can evaluate how that framework gets extended <span class="No-Break">through QIDA.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor464"/>Facilitating informed decision-making</h1>
			<p>Plumbing the depths of <a id="_idIndexMarker788"/>business intelligence can often seem daunting, but the BRIA framework, with its integrated QIDA approach, provides the diving gear for clarity. The QIDA extension to BRIA empowers professionals at all levels – from the C-Suite to managerial tiers to those embedded operationally within value streams – to discern essential questions that lead to informed decisions and purposeful actions. Without this structured inquiry, one might swim against the tide of overwhelming data without the precise insights needed to make informed decisions and take appropriate and <span class="No-Break">timely actions.</span></p>
			<p>So, let’s dive in to see how QIDA refines the BRIA business <span class="No-Break">intelligence model.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor465"/>Navigating the surge of modern data</h2>
			<p>Businesses <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>have been inundated with data largely due to rapid technological advancements, the rise of digital transactions, the proliferation of connected devices, and an ever-growing online user base. The digital era has given birth to many tools and platforms that track, measure, and store eve<a id="_idTextAnchor466"/><a id="_idTextAnchor467"/>ry <span class="No-Break">conceivable metric.</span></p>
			<p>From the Zippia list of <em class="italic">22 Stunning Big Data Statistics [2023]</em>, it’s evident that the granularity with which we can now monitor business operations and consumer behaviors is unprecedented. For example, here are three relevant findings from the Zippia report that make this point clear that we have become very good at capturing data, but most of the data is inaccessible or at least <span class="No-Break">unused: </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">2</span></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">“90% of the world’s data has been created in the last </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">two years.”</em></span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">“The average company doesn’t use 60-73% of its data for analytics. This means that almost three- quarters of the data companies collect goes unanalyzed and, as a </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">result, unused.”</em></span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">“95% of businesses consider the need to manage unstructured data a problem </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">they face.”</em></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Online interactions, social media activity, e-commerce transactions, and even device-to-device communications produce vast amounts of data daily. Moreover, businesses, in their quest to be more data-driven, have adopted systems that capture and store this data, hoping to <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>derive insights and competitive advantages. However, a BRIA assessment will likely determine that we don't need all the data; instead, we need the right data at the right time to answer our most pressing questions. In other words, without the right frameworks and strategies in place, our executives and employees often find themselves overwhelmed not by a lack of data, but by <span class="No-Break">its overabundance.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-267"><a id="_idTextAnchor468"/>Managing data overload</h2>
			<p>While modern enterprise <a id="_idIndexMarker791"/>applications empower organizations to amass vast amounts of information, they also present a dilemma: an overabundance of data can lead to information overload, obscuring clear decision-making. Overcoming these tumultuous waters demands a structured, strategic approach to extracting <span class="No-Break">meaningful insights.</span></p>
			<p>Enter QIDA, the operational sequence designed to harness factual business intelligence. Its foundational premise lies in transforming raw data into real-time, on-demand information. With QIDA, the emphasis shifts to harnessing that data to answer specific questions – the kind of questions that propel action and drive desirable business outcomes when answered with the <span class="No-Break">right information.</span></p>
			<p>The sequential steps of QIDA can be broken down <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Questions</strong>: What are the pivotal queries that need <span class="No-Break">quick answers?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Information</strong>: How should the data be organized, derived, calculated, formatted, and displayed to address our <span class="No-Break">critical questions?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Decision</strong>: Leveraging the derived information to make <span class="No-Break">informed decisions</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Action</strong>: Having accurate and timely information is necessary to take the right actions to address <span class="No-Break">current issues</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Consider the following <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>pharmaceutical industry example of how a QIDA assessment might play out, but purposely specified at a high level <span class="No-Break">to simplify:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Questions</strong>: In the pharmaceutical industry, pivotal queries might include: What are the test criteria for a new drug? When are the review meetings scheduled? What are the preliminary <span class="No-Break">test results?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Information</strong>: To address these critical questions, data must be organized effectively: test criteria and results should be entered into a centralized management tool, meeting schedules should be maintained on shared calendars, and summarized reports should be created for <span class="No-Break">quick reference.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Decision</strong>: Leveraging this organized information, informed decisions can be made. For example, adjustments to the test criteria can be based on preliminary results, or modifications to the drug release schedule can <span class="No-Break">be determined.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Action</strong>: Accurate <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>and timely information enables the right actions, such as implementing changes in the drug release plan to minimize <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>delays and rescheduling meetings to ensure all stakeholders <span class="No-Break">can attend.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor469"/>Crafting actionable intelligence</h2>
			<p>In our previous <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>example, the pharmaceutical company had determined the need to collect facts and organize its data. However, information emerges when one understands the completion timelines of specific analyses, their review periods, and approval processes, all crucial to deciding on the product’s release. The pinnacle is in knowing that all decision criteria have been satisfied, pushing the button on that <span class="No-Break">final decision.</span></p>
			<p>At the heart of this approach lies the concept that not all questions are created equal. Trivial questions yield minimal impact, while pivotal ones can reshape organizational trajectories. In short, the information consumer (by Role) is better off focusing on identifying their 3 to 5 most critical questions rather than trying to think of every possible question. From a Lean-Agile perspective, we can always come back and add more questions as business needs arise <span class="No-Break">or evolve.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, the distinction between <strong class="bold">facts,</strong> <strong class="bold">data,</strong> and <strong class="bold">information</strong> is paramount. Facts are standalone, representing real-world events or measurements. Organizing these facts, such as in a structured database or worksheet tables, gives rise to data. But it is when this data is tailored to answer specific questions that it evolves into <span class="No-Break">actionable information.</span></p>
			<p>In the context of crafting actionable intelligence, knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding and interpreting the organized data. While facts and data provide the foundation, knowledge encompasses the comprehension of the significance of that information. Understanding completion timelines, review periods, and approval processes, for instance, requires knowledge of the industry standards and regulatory requirements. This knowledge is essential for making informed decisions regarding product release, ensuring that all the necessary criteria are met. Thus, knowledge bridges the gap between raw data and actionable information, enabling organizations to leverage data effectively <span class="No-Break">for decision-making.</span></p>
			<p>Our goal, with a <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>QIDA-enriched BRIA strategy, is to guide organizations in their quest for this actionable information. Instead of getting swamped in oceans of data, we equip businesses to mine valuable insights by addressing their most critical questions. After all, in an age of information overload, it’s not the organization that collects the most facts and data but the one that harnesses it most effectively that <span class="No-Break">emerges victorious.</span></p>
			<p>This last passage bears repeating: <em class="italic">Information matters more than the underlying facts or data</em>. Equally important is the application of acquired knowledge to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions based on <span class="No-Break">insights gained.</span></p>
			<p>The following clarifies <span class="No-Break">the distinctions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Facts</strong>: Standalone recordings of events or real-world <span class="No-Break">measurements, unorganized</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data</strong>: Organized facts categorized without a <span class="No-Break">specific purpose</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Information</strong>: Data that is organized and often transformed to address a <span class="No-Break">particular question</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Knowledge</strong>: Comprehension and interpretation of organized data, integrating industry expertise, regulatory understanding, and contextual awareness to extract <span class="No-Break">actionable insights</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This ends our discussion on facilitating informed decision-making and action-taking by applying the concepts of QIDA. Put succinctly, questions drive the need for information that, in turn, enables decision-making and taking appropriate actions based on the user’s knowledge. Moreover, this section illustrated how harnessing the power of the QIDA concept can transform vast data reservoirs into streamlined channels of actionable intelligence. By mastering this concept, you’re better equipped to chart a course that successfully navigates<a id="_idIndexMarker797"/> the challenges and steers you toward your goals in business <span class="No-Break">and life.</span></p>
			<p>The following section is the heart of this chapter: how to conduct a <span class="No-Break">BRIA-based workshop.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor470"/>Conducting BRIA workshops for strategic alignment</h1>
			<p>BRIA <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>workshops guide the work to enable<a id="_idIndexMarker799"/> business intelligence, helping professionals steer a proper course to achieve their business strategies, goals, and objectives. Based on the BRIDAI format, shown in <span class="No-Break">Figure 10</span>.2, these workshops are pivotal for decisions at both executive and <span class="No-Break">operational levels.</span></p>

			<p>As you can infer from the table, <em class="italic">BRIDAI </em>is an acronym that defines the work involved in the combined BRIA/QIDA process. We select a domain to support and identify the critical roles and the questions those folks need to be able to answer. From there, we determine the information they require to support the decisions they need to make. Ultimately, the BRIA workshop’s purpose is to have the right information to make informed decisions and to take responsive actions to achieve expected or desired outcomes. Six examples of completed BRIDAI tables are provided in <em class="italic">Appendices 10.1</em> <span class="No-Break">through </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">10.2</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor471"/>Defining the BRIA/QIDA workshop sessions</h2>
			<p>Organizations that<a id="_idIndexMarker800"/> elect to conduct an BRIA/QIDA assessment should plan on conducting a series of workshops across three different <span class="No-Break">session types:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Session 1 workshops</strong>: Uncovering business <span class="No-Break">outcome questions</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Session 2 workshops</strong>: Conducting facilitated discussions with executives and <span class="No-Break">domain experts</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Session 3 workshops</strong>: Creating BRIDAI tables, action items, <span class="No-Break">and assignments</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The BRIA workshops kick off at the executive level, aligning everyone with organizational goals and ensuring that executives have the right data to evaluate performance against corporate objectives. As executive BRIA workshops evolve, continuing workshops focus on operational-level decision-making, leading to more workshops tailored to business operations at the domain and value stream levels. In other words, these  three sessions occur at the executive, operational, and <span class="No-Break">domain levels.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s explore these three <span class="No-Break">session types.</span></p>
			<h3>Defining Session 1 workshops</h3>
			<p>These commence <a id="_idIndexMarker801"/>with executive-level BRIA workshops, pinpointing desired business outcomes and defining the roles, questions, information, and decisions vital for achieving these outcomes. While these workshops also occur at the operating level, the distinction lies in having a mid-level manager or team lead steer those <span class="No-Break">BRIA discussions.</span></p>
			<h3>Defining Session 2 workshops</h3>
			<p>This session <a id="_idIndexMarker802"/>offers domain and DBMS experts a platform to probe and understand the prerequisites for delivering the information outlined in Session 1. They delve deep, asking questions and clarifying the intricacies of the information requirements. As part of this activity, they assess whether they already have the data or information and where it lives. If they don’t have it, they assess which systems should be used to capture and transpose the data into actionable information. They also explore the best approaches to make the information both available <span class="No-Break">and visible.</span></p>
			<p>The BRIA working <a id="_idIndexMarker803"/>teams may need to conduct additional meetings to work through all the <span class="No-Break">details fully.</span></p>
			<h3>Defining Session 3 workshops</h3>
			<p>The aim of this session is to identify action items, establish priorities, set timelines, and delegate assignments to expand the targeted databases and applications. Moreover, if process enhancements are needed to attain the targeted results, the team also undertakes planning<a id="_idIndexMarker804"/> and task allocation for <span class="No-Break">such improvements.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you know what workshops are required to support an BRIA/QIDA assessment, let’s explore the topic of <span class="No-Break">workshop preparations.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor472"/>Preparing to conduct BRIA workshops</h2>
			<p>This section<a id="_idIndexMarker805"/> further explores the BRIA/QIDA framework and implementation of the BRIA workshops. Each workshop focuses on a specific business domain, which must be identified and described for all workshop participants. The active involvement of both<a id="_idIndexMarker806"/> the <strong class="bold">Executive Sponsor </strong>and domain experts is vital. Moreover, BRIA workshops are divided into executive, domain, and value-stream levels to <span class="No-Break">optimize outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>Given the significant investment of time and resources in BRIA workshops, ensuring strong support is crucial. Inevitably, this requires one or more C-Suite or <strong class="bold">Line of Business </strong>(<strong class="bold">LOB</strong>) executives<a id="_idIndexMarker807"/> to step forward as executive sponsors to support, encourage, and fund <span class="No-Break">the effort.</span></p>
			<p>Traditionally, an<a id="_idIndexMarker808"/> experienced <strong class="bold">Business Analyst </strong>(<strong class="bold">BA</strong>) leads the BRIA workshop, supported by the expertise of DBMS professionals. These DBMS experts must be well-acquainted with the specific business system of the domain in focus. For larger domains involving multiple workshops across various business departments and value stream teams, a facilitator may be required to help schedule and coordinate the <span class="No-Break">workshop events.</span></p>
			<p>The following steps define the <span class="No-Break">BRIA process.</span></p>
			<h3>Scoping the BRIA assessment</h3>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker809"/>activities are necessary to help identify business domains and value streams that define the scope of the BRIA/QIDA assessment, and must be completed prior to conducting the <span class="No-Break">first workshop:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Executive Sponsor determines which business domains and value streams need assistance. While multiple domains may be identified, priority is given to those aligned with the organization’s <span class="No-Break">strategic objectives.</span></li>
				<li>The BA identifies the key executives required for the BRIA workshops within <span class="No-Break">their domains.</span></li>
				<li>The workshop lead initiates communication with the appropriate executive, ensuring that they are equipped to explain the domain’s objectives, roles, responsibilities, primary questions –preferably, no more than three to five questions per executive, and projected actions <span class="No-Break">and outcomes.</span></li>
				<li>Executives are responsible for identifying their domain experts to participate in the <span class="No-Break">BRIA workshops.</span></li>
				<li>The designated BRIA workshop lead schedules the subsequent sessions and sends out the relevant <span class="No-Break">meeting invitations.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Preparing for Session 1 BRIA Workshop</h3>
			<p>The purpose of<a id="_idIndexMarker810"/> session 1 BRIA/QIDA workshop is to discuss and clarify business questions that the organization’s key executives must be able to answer at a moment’s notice to successfully run their businesses. The preparation <span class="No-Break">activities include:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Decision-makers come prepared to discuss their business questions <span class="No-Break">identified earlier</span></li>
				<li>Use a whiteboard (digital or physical) to facilitate discussions of the domain’s objectives, roles and responsibilities, key questions, and ensuing decisions <span class="No-Break">and actions</span></li>
				<li>Domain<a id="_idIndexMarker811"/> experts analyze the discussions and ask clarifying questions, setting the stage for Session 2 </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s move on to introduce the Session 2 <span class="No-Break">preparation activities.</span></p>
			<h3>Preparing for a Session 2 BRIA workshop</h3>
			<p>Session 2 is where <a id="_idIndexMarker812"/>the business domain and technology specialists join the executives to discuss decision-making needs and identify relevant data sources, and should include <span class="No-Break">these activities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The domain experts, the BA, and the DBMS experts engage with the executives, refining their comprehension and probing the nuances of their <span class="No-Break">decision-making needs</span></li>
				<li>The group also analyzes the executive questions and information needs and helping identify the potential sources and availability of data Once Session 2 workshops are completed, we can move on to prepare for <span class="No-Break">Session 3.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Preparing for a Session 3 BRIA workshop</h3>
			<p>The Session 3 <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>workshop is where we create the BRIDAI tables and includes the <span class="No-Break">following activities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The BRIA workshop lead unveils the comprehensive BRIDAI table to the executives and their teams. This table delineates the business domain, role/questions, information, decision, action, and impact. This blueprint aids in crafting impactful business <span class="No-Break">intelligence strategies.</span></li>
				<li>After this session, a list of prioritized actions will be integrated into the BRIA work schedule. The BA consolidates all insights into a BRIDAI table, showcased in a final session with the domain’s team and executives to create action plans, schedules, <span class="No-Break">and responsibilities.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While the previous discussions focused on executive-level BRIA workshops, the steps remain consistent for departmental or value-stream level workshops. The key distinction lies in the source of the questions, which now arise from the area managers’ or team <span class="No-Break">leads’ perspectives.</span></p>
			<p>It’s essential to remember that this book revolves around Lean-Agile practices. At its core is the conviction that the insights necessary to operate and enhance our business are embedded within the individuals executing the work. Therefore, every BRIA workshop should actively seek feedback from the team members and employees in the <span class="No-Break">respective areas.</span></p>
			<p>This ends our introduction to the BRIA workshop sessions. As you progress through this chapter, you’ll gain the expertise to adeptly guide these workshops, fostering collaboration between executives and frontline teams and ultimately leading to organizational success. Next, we’ll delve into the<a id="_idTextAnchor473"/> preparations for a successful <span class="No-Break">BRIA workshop.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-272"><a id="_idTextAnchor474"/>Assembling the BRIA team</h2>
			<p>Assembling the <a id="_idIndexMarker814"/>BRIA team can begin once the executive sponsor signs off on the BRIA workshops. Some organizations may establish executive steering committees to oversee larger-scale information improvement activities, such as the installation of new information systems to support business processes or value stream improvements. Like it or not, budget, scope, resource constraints, and concerns over return on investment (ROI) will always require some degree of <span class="No-Break">executive oversight.</span></p>
			<h3>Selecting the workshop lead</h3>
			<p>The executive <a id="_idIndexMarker815"/>sponsor or their representatives appoint a workshop lead, ideally someone with a BA background familiar with DBMSs. Once identified and onboarded, the lead collaborates with the executive sponsor to identify key business domains that need enhanced data management capabilities. Insight from VSM team leads on identified improvement opportunities and priorities, as detailed in <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Driving Improvements with Value Stream Management (VSM)</em>, can be <span class="No-Break">invaluable here.</span></p>
			<h3>Allocating workshop resources</h3>
			<p>During preparations, it’s <a id="_idIndexMarker816"/>essential to identify key business systems and the necessary DBMS experts. Following the concepts discussed in our BLAST framework (see <a href="B21818_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>), the BRIA team participants will come from various domains and functional groups across the organization. Have the executive sponsor select domain experts who are knowledgeable about operations in the <span class="No-Break">target domain.</span></p>
			<p>The DBMS experts play a critical role. Ultimately, their job is designing system updates and programming the SQL queries vital for new data management requirements identified in the <span class="No-Break">BRIA workshops.</span></p>
			<p>Likewise, the domain<a id="_idIndexMarker817"/> experts are equally important as they provide invaluable insights, from workflow dynamics to areas needing enhancement. While larger teams can participate in BRIA workshops, efficiency will quickly decrease with more than 20 participants. Research on optimal team size recommends 4 to 6 people for problem-solving, increasing to 7 for decision-making, and 10 to 20 <span class="No-Break">for brainstorming.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">3</span></span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s discuss the three types of BRIA <span class="No-Break">workshop sessions.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-273"><a id="_idTextAnchor475"/>Scheduling and conducting BRIA workshops</h2>
			<p>After clarifying the <a id="_idIndexMarker818"/>participants’ roles, the workshop lead or PM sets the schedule. In<a id="_idIndexMarker819"/> Session 1, executives outline domain objectives, roles, responsibilities, and key questions using a linear format – detailed in the upcoming <em class="italic">'Conducting Session1 BRIA workshops' </em>subsection. A BRIDAI form is shared before the session, allowing targeted questions to be pr<a id="_idTextAnchor476"/>e-recorded. </p>
			<p>This session lasts at least 30 minutes. Session 2 lasts 50 minutes to 2 hours and dives deep into data needs, integrations, and transformations, all necessary for executive queries. By Session 3, the team reviews the BRIDAI table, transitioning from linear-horizontal to a concise vertical <span class="No-Break">table format.</span></p>
			<p>This wraps up BRIA workshop preparations. The next subsection delves into the details of conducting  Session 1 workshops with the goal to identify the role's critical <span class="No-Break">business questions.</span></p>
			<h3>Conducting Session 1 BRIA workshops</h3>
			<p>The purpose of<a id="_idIndexMarker820"/> Session 1 BRIA workshops is to identify critical business questions, which we can also refer to as business outcome questions. In other words, all questions are designed to pull the information needed to create a desired business outcome through <span class="No-Break">informed decision-making.</span></p>
			<p>The BRIA workshop facilitator will spend a few moments on introductions and explaining the BRIA, BRIDAI, and QIDA concepts (suggested timebox: <span class="No-Break">30 minutes).</span></p>
			<p>Ideally, to conserve time, the executive sponsors will come to the BRIA workshop prepared with three to five key business questions they want to always be able to answer and the type of information they believe is necessary to answer those questions. If the executives don’t know what information they need, they can just bring the questions they want to be able to answer. They should also be able to discuss the types of decisions and actions they expect to make with <span class="No-Break">each question.</span></p>
			<p>The inaugural session of the BRIA workshop tailored for executives focuses on extracting the most pressing questions crucial to an organization’s strategic aims and operations. Typically, the company’s Executive Sponsors or the designated facilitator will list these questions – no more than five per role, on a whiteboard – physical or electronic – following a linear format. This format combines the BRIA and QIDA formats, and is essential for categorizing questions and their related information. Participants then delve into each question, spending roughly 10 minutes elucidating the rationale behind their queries to the larger group. This thorough explanation of the <em class="italic">Questions, Information, Decisions</em>, and (optional) <em class="italic">Actions </em>(<strong class="bold">QIDA</strong>) is <a id="_idIndexMarker821"/>vital for a comprehensive understanding of why these questions are important. The session primes the team for clarity, ensuring that everyone is aligned with the company’s strategic vision and <span class="No-Break">tactical objectives.</span></p>
			<p>Session 1 asks the<a id="_idIndexMarker822"/> primary decision makers to step forward and describe the top three to five questions about their business that keep them up at night. On a whiteboard, the lead decision maker presents information about the business domain they oversee, their specific roles and responsibilities, key questions they must be able to answer at a moment’s notice, and the potential decisions and actions they need to take. Their teams listen as the executives explain the relevance of this information to <span class="No-Break">their operations.</span></p>
			<h4>Session 1 (suggested timebox: 50 minutes)</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>The Executive Sponsors or the facilitator will write the five questions out on a physical or electronic whiteboard in a linear format. (Use Executive Team – Sample BRIA – QIDA Model – Linear Format as shown in <span class="No-Break">Figure 10</span><span class="No-Break">.3.)</span></li>
				<li>The executive Sponsors should spend up to 10 minutes describing the QIDA reasoning behind their questions to the <span class="No-Break">entire group.</span></li>
				<li>Continue to use the BRIA-QIDA format (i.e., linear list format) to display the information captured over the course of <span class="No-Break">the workshops.</span></li>
				<li>The BRIA-QIDA table in the linear format includes the following columns: Business, Role, Key <a id="_idIndexMarker823"/>Questions, Decisions, Actions, Reasons, Information, Data Sources, <span class="No-Break">Exists (Y/N).</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Conducting Session 2 BRIA workshops</h3>
			<p>The purpose of <a id="_idIndexMarker824"/>Session 2 BRIA workshops is to bring in other domain experts so that the lead can facilitate a collaborative exchange of ideas on what information and data transformations are required to support the identified business questions. We also need to identify whether the data and information already exist and are available in the right form. So, the second session is where collaboration and idea generation take the <span class="No-Break">front seat.</span></p>
			<p>Various brainstorming techniques help simplify this <span class="No-Break">facilitation process:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mind mapping </strong>offers <a id="_idIndexMarker825"/>a visual exploration of concepts. Starting from a central point and branching out, it captures related subtopics or pivotal <span class="No-Break">ideas visually.</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Delphi technique </strong>is an<a id="_idIndexMarker826"/> approach to collect expert inputs while retaining the participants’ anonymity. This iterative method thrives on group dynamics and is excellent for reaching <span class="No-Break">a consensus.</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Nominal Group Method </strong>(<strong class="bold">NGM</strong>) is a<a id="_idIndexMarker827"/> step-by-step brainstorming technique in which participants jot down ideas and then share them individually, facilitating a collaborative discussion. Eventually, the group prioritizes the ideas, resulting in <span class="No-Break">collective decisions.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Session 2 – (suggested timebox: 50 minutes)</h4>
			<p>In Session 2, the executive’s team members ask questions to refine their understanding of this information. They must understand the motivations and reasoning that guide executive decision-making. Moreover, the team begins to get more granular about the information requirements and discuss whether or where the required <span class="No-Break">information exists.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Pivot to group discussion sessions to dive deeper into evaluating the identified key questions regarding data and information requirements, potential data sources, and data availability. (Use Executive Team – Sample BRIA-QIDA Model – <span class="No-Break">Linear Format.)</span></li>
				<li>To complete the rows used to capture information across specific business roles, participants can use brainstorming techniques such as mind mapping, the Delphi technique, <span class="No-Break">or NGM.</span></li>
				<li>Ten minutes are allotted per question spread across one 50-minute or two <span class="No-Break">30-minute sessions.</span></li>
				<li>For larger<a id="_idIndexMarker828"/> groups, teams can be split by interests to include a mix of SMEs from the organization in the represented <span class="No-Break">business domains.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>These techniques ensure that every participant contributes effectively to the discussions regardless of position <span class="No-Break">or expertise.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Session 3 – (suggested timebox: </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">50 minutes)</strong></span></p>
			<h3>Conducting Session 3 BRIA Workshops</h3>
			<p>The purpose of the<a id="_idIndexMarker829"/> Session 3 workshops is to create comprehensive BRIA-QIDA information displays (see <span class="No-Break">Figure 10</span>.3) for each business role, presented in a horizontal format known as BRIDAI tables. These tables serve as blueprints for defining the organization’s most critical business questions, identifying related data and information needs, and determining the appropriate actions to support business decisions. The goal of this exercise is to ensure the most important information is available in proper context, instantly, on-demand, and at a <span class="No-Break">moment’s notice.</span></p>
			<p>The primary activities associated with conduction the session 3 workshop include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Prior to the workshop, the BRIA workshop facilitator summarizes findings in BRIDAI tables and either discusses them in a group session or emails them to all workshop participants to prior to the Session <span class="No-Break">3 workshop.</span></li>
				<li>BRIA workshop participants can add columns to the BRIA table as necessary. In other words, the team can extend the BRIA-QIDA formats. For example, they may add sections to capture question/ information context, data tables and fields, metrics, and any necessary <span class="No-Break">data transformations.</span></li>
				<li>The BRIA workshop facilitator passes the information along to the business’s DBMS and applications experts to create prototypes to present later in demo and approval sessions. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the third session, the BRIA workshop lead presents the information in a BRIDAI table format, as illustrated in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>. Also, refer to <em class="italic">Appendices 10.1</em> through <em class="italic">10.2</em>. to see additional examples of completed BRIDAI tables. This format provides a clear and concise plan of action to build the business intelligence your executives and team members need to make informed decisions, take appropriate actions supporting your organization’s strategic objectives, and quickly respond to <span class="No-Break">operational issues.</span></p>
			<p>Post discussions, the workshop’s primary output is the completed BRIDAI table. The BRIDAI format encourages teams to focus exclusively on one business role at a time, ensuring a thorough investigation of information needs and action items to make the <span class="No-Break">information available.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at an example to see how questioning in one business function or domain area can lead to follow-up questions in other areas. We have created a linear BRIDAI table for this example, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>. In this case, the CFO needs to assess whether they have sufficient funds to cover their costs over the next period. However, to answer that question, they will need input from the executives managing the organization’s sales and <span class="No-Break">marketing functions.</span></p>

			<p>After charting <a id="_idIndexMarker832"/>the course with BRIA workshops, it’s time to implement the insights, ensuring our organization is well equipped to embark on its journey to actionable decision-making. We cannot overstate the critical role of the IT department in bringing to life the insights identified during the <span class="No-Break">BRIA process.</span></p>
			<p>Like a seasoned crew preparing for a new voyage, IT now takes the helm, transforming the BRIA- derived insights into actionable IT strategies and solutions. These changes may encompass new data fields, UDFs, data transformations, or even the introduction of entirely new <span class="No-Break">information systems.</span></p>
			<p>Whether you’re an executive setting the strategic direction, a manager overseeing operations, or<a id="_idTextAnchor477"/><a id="_idTextAnchor478"/> a team member executing tasks, it’s essential to understand how these IT decisions directly impact the flow of information and the organization’s overall performance. Essentially, it’s about ensuring the organization sails steadily toward its goals, fully informed and effectively powered by its <span class="No-Break">IT systems.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we’ll explore a specific example of how AI tools and technologies are evolving to support BRIA <span class="No-Break">workshop activities.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-274"><a id="_idTextAnchor479"/>Leveraging AI-based tools to support BRIA workshops</h1>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker833"/>originator of the ‘Ladder of Business Intelligence’ (LOBI now LOBAI – Ladder of Business and Artificial Intelligence) concepts outlined in this chapter is James E. Cates. He has an impressive background <span class="No-Break">that includes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Co-founder of Watson Group at IBM and its <span class="No-Break">underlying technologies.</span></li>
				<li>Former global head of Software R&amp;D <span class="No-Break">at IBM</span></li>
				<li>Former CIO at Brocade, Silicon Graphics, Synopsys, <span class="No-Break">and Altera</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With this background, you might imagine that he is attempting to apply modern AI-based technologies to support this approach to creating the <em class="italic">Intelligent Business</em>, and you would be correct. He is a co-founder of <strong class="bold">Quarrio </strong>and <a id="_idIndexMarker834"/>guides this company’s technology to support the LOBAI strategy along with another co-founder Earl Sacerdoti, who has similarly <span class="No-Break">impressive credentials:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Former associate director of artificial intelligence at <strong class="bold">Stanford Research Institute </strong>(<strong class="bold">SRI</strong>) where<a id="_idIndexMarker835"/> he was involved with the development of Apple’s <span class="No-Break">Siri technology</span></li>
				<li>Co-founder of the American Association of <span class="No-Break">Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
				<li>Co-founded Symantec and built their first product; held bottom-line responsibility up <span class="No-Break">to IPO</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Their's is but one approach in the AI community to make information immediately available, relevant, and accurate. In their approach, Quarrio’s software<a id="_idIndexMarker836"/> integrates <strong class="bold">Natural Language Understanding </strong>(<strong class="bold">NLU</strong>) capabilities and a user interface that appears to offer functionalities similar<a id="_idIndexMarker837"/> to <strong class="bold">Generative Pre-trained Transformer </strong>(<strong class="bold">GPT</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Large Language Model </strong>(<strong class="bold">LLM</strong>) tools such as ChatGPT. However, their underlying<a id="_idIndexMarker838"/> mechanisms operate in distinctly <span class="No-Break">different ways.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, ChatGPT relies on <a id="_idIndexMarker839"/>deep-learning <strong class="bold">neural network </strong>structures, utilizing <strong class="bold">machine learning </strong>methodologies<a id="_idIndexMarker840"/> for pre-training on extensive and varied digital data and linguistic resources within datasets. Subsequently, it undergoes fine-tuning to accommodate specific tasks related to information retrieval. In the realm of machine learning, a prevalent objective involves developing algorithms capable of learning from data and making predictions. This can be termed<a id="_idIndexMarker841"/> a <strong class="bold">bottom-up approach</strong>, where the machine looks for patterns in large amounts of data to create pattern recognition <span class="No-Break">and prediction.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, Quarrio adopts a multi-level <strong class="bold">semantic grammar </strong>approach, also known as a <strong class="bold">symbolic </strong>approach, to<a id="_idIndexMarker842"/> information retrieval. This method diverges from the<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> probabilistic pattern recognition of models such as ChatGPT by instructing computing systems about the semantics – meaning of words and phrases – and the grammar rules of natural languages such <span class="No-Break">as English.</span></p>
			<p>Quarrio’s approach<a id="_idIndexMarker844"/> addresses a fundamental challenge in NLU systems, commonly referred to as an “AI-hard” problem, which Quarrio is tackling. Quarrio’s software operates on a <strong class="bold">top-down approach</strong>, utilizing <a id="_idIndexMarker845"/>a grammatical simulation to precisely interpret user requests and generate SQL queries, in contrast to the probabilistic methodologies employed by models such as GPT and other LLMs, which rely more on statistical inference. This emphasis on accuracy and precision is particularly valuable in regulated industries or functions where these qualities are critical, ensuring that outcomes meet stringent <span class="No-Break">regulatory standards.</span></p>
			<p>This distinction is crucial; unlike approaches that rely on probabilistic guesswork to interpret user queries, Quarrio <a id="_idIndexMarker846"/>leverages the user’s natural language input to dynamically generate a SQL query. This method ensures that the query retrieves and displays information from trusted data sources, directly relevant to the user’s request. The output follows a <strong class="bold">deterministic pattern</strong>, meaning it produces consistent and predictable results every time, which can be crucial in environments requiring high reliability <span class="No-Break">and traceability.</span></p>
			<p>In addition, the deterministic nature of the output allows for thorough validation through audit trails and other methods. This ensures consistency and accuracy in the information retrieval process. Furthermore, both users and DBMS experts have the option to toggle a feature on or off to see how the user’s sentences were interpreted and the SQL queries it generated. This feature enhances the system’s transparency and assures users of the accuracy of <span class="No-Break">the results.</span></p>
			<p>However, a significant challenge with symbolic tools such as Quarrio<a id="_idIndexMarker847"/> is the potential for ambiguity, as different industries, domains, and even individual users may interpret the same or similar language terms differently in specific contexts. To address this, Quarrio utilizes a <em class="italic">multi-level grammar architecture </em>designed to incorporate these variances and has developed a configuration tool that enables non-technical users to map language terms and business concepts to their specific uses within the domain’s data stores. This strategy ensures accurate mapping of terms to concepts and effective information retrieval. Ultimately, the precision of the retrieved information depends solely on the organization’s data <a id="_idIndexMarker848"/>and its repository of domain-specific <span class="No-Break">semantic mappings.</span></p>
			<p>This does not imply that GPT/LLM-based technologies are more accurate than symbolic approaches; in fact, it’s quite the opposite. GPT/LLM-based tools rely on statistical inference and are fundamentally probabilistic. This means that, at best, they can achieve high levels of accuracy but can never be completely precise. Nor will they return the same <span class="No-Break">result predictably.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, GPT-based tools are known to experience episodes <a id="_idIndexMarker849"/>of <strong class="bold">hallucinating</strong>, where they generate nonsensical, irrelevant, or even misleading responses. This phenomenon can occur due to various factors, including a lack of context, ambiguity in the user’s language, biases in training data, and limitations in the model’s understanding of <span class="No-Break">semantic meanings.</span></p>
			<p>Users often cannot detect when GPT-based AI tools <em class="italic">hallucinate </em>unless the errors are obvious, and the opaque nature of these systems complicates understanding how responses are generated. Consequently, while useful for general queries, GPT-based tools should not be used for critical decision-making or automating vital business processes without <span class="No-Break">external checks.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, Quarrio’s deterministic approach, based on clear semantic mappings and grammar rules, ensures reliable and traceable outputs, making it trustworthy for sectors such as healthcare, finance, and legal, where accuracy and traceability are crucial and errors can have <span class="No-Break">severe consequences.</span></p>
			<p>While Quarrio’s tools are currently being launched onto the market, they remain in the early stages of commercialization and have yet to be extensively market-tested. For full disclosure, one of our authors, Gary Rupp, has provided consulting support to Quarrio’s <span class="No-Break">executive team.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-275"><a id="_idTextAnchor480"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter delved into the vast sea of data that organizations continuously collect, highlighting the challenge of navigating this abundance to find essential information for business operations. It shed light on the importance of clearly defining the information needs of executives responsible for data retrieval, as well as the team members who fine-tune daily operations, by introducing the QIDA concepts embodied in the BRIA process to bridge <span class="No-Break">this gap.</span></p>
			<p>Exploring our digital age, characterized by vast volumes of data in which we can easily get lost, this chapter served as a navigational chart through two critical journeys. Firstly, it outlined the importance of strategic objectives and profitability markers for executives, emphasizing their role in guiding the organization’s direction. Secondly, it underscored the significance of operational teams in ensuring the harmonious alignment of value streams toward <span class="No-Break">corporate goals.</span></p>
			<p>These insights are crucial as organizations often struggle to extract actionable insights from vast datasets, hindering informed decision-making. This chapter offered methods to distill and harness vast amounts of data into actionable information, empowering you to help shape the efficiency and trajectory of your organization’s <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>Building upon these foundations, the next chapter, Implementing Strategies for Organizational Transformation, serves as a practical guide for executives and VSM teams seeking to implement Lean-Agile practices throughout their organization. There you will gain further insights into creating a sustainable culture of continuous improvement by exploring practical strategies for implementing Lean-Agile and value stream <span class="No-Break">management practices.</span></p>

				<li value="1">Zippia’s report reveals that while businesses produce 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily and heavily invest in big data and AI, 60-73% of this data remains unanalyzed, highlighting a gap between data availability and <span class="No-Break">effective utilization.</span></li>
				<li>The BRIA process defines the workshop approach while the QIDA concept emphasizes that key questions drive decisions and actions. Together, they align data analysis with business needs, turning raw data into actionable insights using the linear (BRIA-QIDA) and vertical (<span class="No-Break">BRIDAI) tables.</span></li>
				<li>The BRIA process aligns an organization’s information needs with its business objectives across all roles, ensuring decision-makers have the necessary data-driven insights to shape and influence <span class="No-Break">strategies effectively.</span></li>
				<li>The BRIA process identifies core processes and value streams, defines key roles, and determines the specific information needs of each role, ensuring tailored, relevant insights support <span class="No-Break">informed decision-making.</span></li>
				<li>QIDA structures the approach to business intelligence by identifying essential questions and gathering relevant data, leading to informed decisions and <span class="No-Break">purposeful actions.</span></li>
				<li>Facts are basic recorded events, data organizes these facts, and information emerges when data is analyzed to answer specific questions, making it actionable <span class="No-Break">for decision-making.</span></li>
				<li>BRIA Workshops align professional roles with business domains to ensure data-driven decisions at all levels, using the BRIDAI format to connect roles with <span class="No-Break">business strategies.</span></li>
				<li>The BRIA Workshop process includes the Preparatory Phase, Session 1 (discussing business questions), Session 2 (engaging domain experts), and Session 3 (presenting the BRIDAI table), ensuring systematic alignment from needs <span class="No-Break">to actions.</span></li>
				<li>BRIA Workshops involve key decision-makers in identifying core processes, defining roles, and organizing information needs, crafting a BRIDAI table as a blueprint for impactful business <span class="No-Break">intelligence strategies.</span></li>
				<li>The IT department implements BRIA-derived insights into actionable IT strategies and solutions, ensuring the IT infrastructure supports the flow of information and aligns with <span class="No-Break">strategic directions.</span></li>
