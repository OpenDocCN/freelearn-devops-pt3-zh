<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">The bottom-up strategy trap</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">The</span><a id="_idIndexMarker150"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> first variation of this anti-pattern starts with a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">bottom-up cloud adoption approach</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> and typically provides some quick wins. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Stakeholders of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker151"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1"> a digital transformation initiative realize that the lead times to release an application should be shorter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Those include waiting times such as onboarding a new vendor because various departments, including Legal, Procurement, and Tax, need approval, or a supplier can only deliver the required hardware in a few weeks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">Then, the software products need to be installed, configured, tested, and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker152"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> registered in the asset registry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">The sponsor then requests a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">value stream map</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1"> that lays out the current process and timelines and compares them to what can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">be done.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">It turns out the teams</span><a id="_idIndexMarker153"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> can deliver the product in half the time if they leverage a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">cloud native approach</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">That sounds great, doesn’t it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">Especially when we see quick wins and get confidence that the critical go-live deadline can be met. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">But long-term operational thoughts won’t get enough consideration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.5">Standardization across the organization will hardly be considered because the actual viewpoint is the initiative, which might be a project, product, or program of a business domain (group </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">of projects).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">The lack of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker154"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1"> standardization will impact the cultural aspects, such as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">DevSecOps</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> and technology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">In this scenario, we will have a business alignment with a project/product or product portfolio but not across the enterprise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">This misalignment will result in an inhomogeneous culture and inconsistent technology stack across the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">It is only sustainable if a business unit does not have synergies with other business units. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.5">In other words, the business unit is entirely self-sufficient and cannot leverage the common building blocks of other business units. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.6">This scenario is very often not the case, and it illustrates the bottom-up variation of this anti-pattern. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.7">Even in this case, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">siloing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker155"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">still a genuine concern since it can have a negative impact on collaboration, learning, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">and productivity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Let’s now look into the top-down variation of this anti-pattern, which brings </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">different challenges.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">The primary driver for </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">multi-cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1"> is to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker163"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">avoid vendor lock-in, and cloud segmentation is usually driven by capability strength in a broader picture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">Poly-cloud and multi-cloud adoptions result in a very steep learning curve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">Common scenarios are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">Depending on the usage, it might mean the data team needs to learn how to manage data in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">multiple clouds</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">If the data is managed in one cloud and everything else in other clouds, then the network team needs to be skilled in all the involved clouds to establish redundant links </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">between clouds</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">We can imagine how complex the operating model becomes when several CSPs are involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">Some foundational constructs, such</span><a id="_idIndexMarker164"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1"> as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">availability zones</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">, differ between CSPs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">Even the term </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Private Link</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">, a service name that AWS and Azure use, works very differently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">CSPs also </span><a id="_idIndexMarker165"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">charge </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">data egress fees</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">If we have an application running in Azure and the data resides in AWS, we must pay egress data fees in AWS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">Another common side effect of this scenario is that only the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">common denominator</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1"> is implemented to achieve consistency across cloud platforms, which prevents us from utilizing the CSP features to their fullest extent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">The </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">top-down approach</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1"> has good</span><a id="_idIndexMarker166"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1"> intentions, too, but it does not consider the cultural challenges, the steep learning curve, and the required high degree of collaboration and change management to a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">full extent.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">Let’s step through three common variations of this anti-pattern, starting with the myth of organic growth of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">cloud footprint.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">Growing the cloud footprint organically</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">This anti-pattern starts </span><a id="_idIndexMarker231"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">when an organization wants to organically grow its presence in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.2">As a consequence, there is no migration initiative, which results in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker232"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">slow cloud up-ramp</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">, typically only for new applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.2">Some existing on-premises applications might be extended to a hybrid cloud solution because of on-premises </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">scalability issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">A typical case involves a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">content distribution network</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">CDN</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">), a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker233"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">web application firewall, an API gateway, and a queue in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.2">The cloud native components can handle peak loads, and the on-premises app can pull from the queue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.3">What was initially intended to be temporary can easily become permanent because there is no strong desire to move the rest into the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.4">After all, the team members have never gained sufficient migration experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.5">The burden here is that </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">troubleshooting</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1"> becomes more complex because errors can occur on both sides. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.2">It is the same with evidence collection</span><a id="_idIndexMarker234"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1"> for </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">compliance audits</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.2">We have seen organizations that started their cloud adoption 8 years ago but only had 20% of the workloads in the cloud, and the rest was still on-premises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.3">The vast majority of the cloud applications were new applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.4">The problem is that organic growth is unlikely to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">gain momentum.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">Therefore, we will deal with legacy applications for a long time and won’t be able to fully unlock the potential of cloud </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">native stacks.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">Lack of migration guidance</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">Another variation of this anti-pattern is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker235"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">not having a migration decision framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.2">Without a framework that guides us to which cloud platform to migrate to, we will need to make case-by-case decisions, which will take too long, and the decisions will not be consistent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.3">We also do not know what the actual migration treatment should look like. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.4">A </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">treatment plan</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1"> will</span><a id="_idIndexMarker236"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1"> describe what refactoring steps we take to make an application more cloud-friendly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.2">Organizations that do not have that framework in place make case-by-case decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.3">This brings several problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.4">The decisions will not be consistent because there is a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">lack of standardization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">, which </span><a id="_idIndexMarker237"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">will increase the operational complexity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.2">The decision process will take longer because it is not standardized. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.3">The migration process will take longer because every migration is treated differently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.4">This can be a big burden on the application teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.5">Because of all the disadvantages, migrations will be perceived as painful and energy-draining. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.6">This will then reduce the willingness to migrate more applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.7">This results in the same outcome as the previous variation of this anti-pattern: we cannot leverage the full cloud native advantages because we are stuck in the legacy on-premises world for too long. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.8">It also means that we still need to continue with our data center refresh program. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.9">Once the hardware is renewed, we have spent considerable funding that could have been used </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">for migrations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">We can see how this turns into a long-winded story that doesn’t seem to end. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.2">But how can we fix it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.3">How can we develop a structured migration strategy that helps us standardize migrations, flattens the learning curve, speeds up the migration progress, and delivers robust cloud native solutions that support business agility? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.4">We have seen that a slow organic approach does not help us gain momentum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.5">Only once we gain momentum can we accelerate</span><a id="_idIndexMarker238"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1"> the cloud migration, increase migration efficiency, and improve our applications’ operational efficiency and business agility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.2">Now is the time to explore a framework that will help us achieve repeatable outcomes and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">gain momentum.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">Lack of a service catalog</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">A service catalog contains </span><a id="_idIndexMarker239"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">blueprints that can be deployed in a self-service fashion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.2">The service catalog offers reusable building blocks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.3">Without a service catalog, we will have inconsistent and slow migrations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.4">We need to set priorities for our service catalog items to make sure that high-impact items are implemented first. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.5">We also need to make sure that we address our requirements properly, including non-functional requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.6">Otherwise, we will run into issues when we ramp up our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">migration journey.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.1">The motivation to be a freelancer is typically independence and a higher remuneration, depending on the job market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.2">The next election had an indirect impact on the government organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.3">Contracts of freelancers that had been there for more than three years could not be extended. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.4">New contractors were brought on board, and they had a smorgasbord of tools, frameworks, and coding practices in front of them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.5">The problem was that they couldn’t pick and choose. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.6">They had to digest it all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.7">Therefore, the learning curve is steep and there are many unknowns. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.8">This increases the time until new team members can be productive, and it also brings additional risk because of the unknowns. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.9">The situation can only be fixed by allocating time and budget to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.827.1">remediation initiatives.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.828.1">Knowledge outsourcing to consultancies</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.1">Another time, I was employed by a consulting</span><a id="_idIndexMarker302"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.1"> firm that had a cloud/DevOps engagement with a bank. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.2">The customer had a lot of different consultancies in the mix. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.3">Business units could decide which consultancy they want to bring in. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.4">One third party specializing in software engineering and APIs was attached to one business unit and a different one to another, and there were consultancies specializing in AWS and a different one in Azure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.5">Some consultancies had been there for years, and their technology frameworks had changed during the long-term engagement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.6">Having many consultancies in the vendor mix, combined with changing technology stacks and patterns, made it obvious that there are many moving parts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.7">It became obvious that there was no overarching governance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.8">The CI/CD toolchain and applications became unmanageable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.9">Of course, consultancies also have to rotate their staff, because one of the personal drivers of a consultant is to get new challenges frequently and not get stuck in one place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.10">This needs to be considered in project plans since there is extra time that needs to be allocated for handovers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.11">One of the big global consultancies also brought in many junior consultants to maximize its profit, and the senior consultants did not challenge the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.831.1">quality shortcomings.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.1">If we end up with these types of anti-patterns, not only will the frameworks and technology be inconsistent but so will the quality, levels of automation, observability granularity, log statements, deployment architectures, recovery procedures, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.2">As a result, the organization becomes paralyzed and cannot react swiftly to market changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.3">It is critical to understand that consultants and freelancers need to be treated as accelerators, not as replacements for internal knowledge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.4">So, how can we spot this anti-pattern to make sure </span><a id="_idIndexMarker303"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.833.1">we can take the right measures? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.833.2">We will find out now when we investigate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.1">the indicators.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.1">These are examples of cultural observations </span><a id="_idIndexMarker304"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.838.1">that indicate problems with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.839.1">knowledge outsourcing:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.840.1">Ramp-up time</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.841.1">: It takes new joiners an unreasonable amount of time to become productive and understand the landscape. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.841.2">This is an especially strong indicator if even senior developers or engineers take longer than three months to get up to speed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.841.3">They have usually broad experience with tooling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.841.4">If they take a long time, this is a hint that either the CI/CD landscape is defragmented or out of date, or processes and ways of working are not as agile as they should be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.841.5">In this scenario, it is a good idea to ask the new joiners what the challenges are and capture structured feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.841.6">We could also engage a third party to assess the current CI/CD and cloud landscape and come up with recommendations </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.842.1">and priorities.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.1">Resource bottlenecks</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.1">: Initiatives are impacted if the most knowledgeable person is away. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.2">This strongly indicates that knowledge is not being shared across the organization, which is a major risk for the organization, especially when that individual leaves the organization or requires unplanned leave. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.3">Pair programming, shadowing, and reverse-shadowing can close that knowledge gap. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.4">We also need a clear definition of ready, which means the requirements are ready to start the design or a design is ready for implementation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.5">This will depend on the definitions within </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.845.1">a team.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.1">Outsourcing everything</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.847.1">: It becomes obvious that most cloud engagements need to be outsourced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.847.2">This could be because of internal resource constraints or lacking internal skills and experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.847.3">Let’s explore this in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.848.1">more detail:</span></span><ul><li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.849.1">Lack of internal resources</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.1">: If we do not have the resources, we must validate that enough time is allocated for our team members to collaborate with the external partner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.2">We must understand and influence decisions to align with our vision, best practices, and operational needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.3">Otherwise, we will have the technology and framework sprawl, and the team will not know the internals of the application or product produced by the consulting firm. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.4">Even if the team has the required training in the cloud platform and CI/CD, they will not know enough about what has been delivered and deployed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.851.1">into production.</span></span></li><li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.852.1">Lack of skills</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.1">: If the internal team cannot implement a new cloud initiative because of a lack of skills and experience, it is obvious that more training is required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.2">We will need a combination of standardized learning for cloud and CI/CD, but we also need contextual learning on how to apply those things in our organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.3">This can be learned with team augmentation and working alongside an external party. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.4">The knowledge transfer must be addressed in the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.854.1">statement of work</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.855.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.856.1">SoW</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.857.1">), and it </span><a id="_idIndexMarker305"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.858.1">needs to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker306"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.859.1"> be regularly validated during a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.860.1">consulting engagement.</span></span></li></ul></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.861.1">DevSecOps culture</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.1">: Another giveaway for a knowledge gap is the absence of a DevSecOps culture or manual steps in the CI/CD process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.2">We talked about the DevSecOps culture</span><a id="_idIndexMarker307"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.863.1"> earlier, and we can improve or establish it through team augmentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.863.2">The main reasons for a lack of automation and relying on manual steps in the CI/CD process are insufficient knowledge or cutting quality corners due to rushed deadlines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.863.3">Both are risks to the organization and need to be addressed by allocating enough time to fix the issue and ensuring the teams have the required</span><a id="_idIndexMarker308"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.864.1"> knowledge or can gain it through the previously discussed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.865.1">learning methods.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.1">As we can see, the root cause of this problem category is quite often a lack of training and experience to establish an effective governance procedure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.2">But there are also other areas that indicate problems, and we will look into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.867.1">them now.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.868.1">Indicators in our documents and systems</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.869.1">The following indicators can be </span><a id="_idIndexMarker309"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.870.1">found in existing documentation, including contracts, and in systems that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.1">we use:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.872.1">Outsourcing contracts are missing fundamental information</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.1">: Before the engagement starts, a mutual contract is signed between both parties, commonly known as the SoW. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.2">If the SoW does not reference internal CI/CD practices such as code scanning, branching model, CI/CD workflows, coding style guides, and observability standards, this should raise alarm bells. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.3">Standards and frameworks must be referenced in a SoW if they are in place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.4">Otherwise, the outcome will not meet our expectations, and we will need to deal with technical debt, governance challenges, maintenance complexity, and avoidable operational complexity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.5">It is time to act immediately if we don’t have those standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.6">If internal team members do not know how to articulate those standards, the next engagement with our trusted cloud consultancy should be establishing or maturing those standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.7">This engagement will need full support from the technology and business teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.8">It is a very strong sign that we do not have the knowledge to govern our cloud native initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.9">This means that governance happens outside of the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.10">This is a guarantee for failure since this approach will not meet our organization’s needs and strategic direction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.11">We need to make this standardization engagement a priority. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.12">More importantly, we need someone who can work closely with the consultancy and learn all about the best practices while also doing some theory education such as a classroom or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.874.1">online course.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.875.1">Analyzing the training budget and skill certifications</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.1">: Numbers don’t lie. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.2">Our team members cannot reimburse expenses for training or conferences without a dedicated training budget for ongoing learning unless we use some creative accounting techniques. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.3">Some team members might be willing to absorb those expenses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.4">From a corporate point of view, it would be fair to budget for it and pay those expenses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.5">How else could our company expect to remain abreast of the rapid pace of innovation in the technology space without supporting our employees in remaining up to date with our knowledge? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.6">In the end, we will achieve a better corporate outcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.7">We need to work out a training plan that aligns with the experience level of our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.877.1">team structure.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.878.1">Cloud native skills are not reflected in job descriptions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.879.1">: If the required experience level is not articulated in the job description or is not quantifiable, then we need to work on a skill matrix for each experience level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.879.2">Then, we can work out a gap analysis to see which areas need improvement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.879.3">This will help to look up what training we need and what the cost will be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.879.4">It is important to cover the following areas in the training plan: DevSecOps and Agile, security, CI/CD, governance, and technology, including development, operations, and observability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.879.5">It is important to get those numbers into the next budget. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.879.6">If any budget during the current financial year can be repurposed, we are already in a better position because </span><a id="_idIndexMarker310"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.880.1">we have worked out the training numbers, gaps, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.881.1">and benefits.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.882.1">Over-privileged user permissions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.1">: Another way to indicate we are heading toward this anti-pattern is to validate human permissions in our identity and access management roles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.2">If no one has the skills to validate this, that should ring alarm bells. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.3">If we discover that humans have permissions that should not be needed in a mature DevSecOps culture, this is a strong indicator of the immediate need for training. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.4">If humans require write permissions to change either database schemes or ingest data into a database, there could be two reasons for this: either the permissions are not required or we are not following least privilege best practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.5">The likely option is that our teams are not following DevSecOps best practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.6">In this case, we have to allocate time to establish those capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.7">In our example, we will need data ingestion patterns articulating how tooling can help to import data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.8">If the team doesn’t have experience in that area, it will highlight another need for training. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.9">By now, we know that learning includes generalized learning provided in a course and pairing up with</span><a id="_idIndexMarker311"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.884.1"> externals who have done </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.885.1">that before.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.886.1">Similar to the cultural indicator category, we can see that a lack of training and experience is causing problems, and we will later explain how this impacts operations and delivery. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.886.2">We now have a good understanding of how to spot indicators within our documentation and systems and we will move on to operational and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.887.1">delivery indicators.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.888.1">Operational and delivery indicators</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.889.1">The following indicators become </span><a id="_idIndexMarker312"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.890.1">obvious while we operate our applications or when we want to implement changes or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.891.1">new features:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.892.1">Every little change takes an unreasonable amount of time</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.893.1">: This indicates technology and framework sprawl as a result of governance gaps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.893.2">Those gaps are likely due to a need for more knowledge to govern technology and process decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.893.3">We must upskill our team to govern initiatives, review outcomes, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.894.1">make recommendations.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.895.1">No long-term fix for outages</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.896.1">: There are outages, and the teams can fix them quickly but do not know how to improve the situation strategically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.896.2">This indicates a lack of observability and, potentially, a shortcoming in technology refreshes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.896.3">Both could have happened due to a timeline rush, a lack of observability experience, or tooling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.896.4">This will require a root cause analysis to determine what actions need to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.897.1">be taken.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.898.1">Significant findings in advisory tools</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.899.1">: An advisory scanning tool, such as a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.900.1">cloud native application protection platform</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.901.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.902.1">CNAPP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.903.1">) shows many findings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.903.2">These include unencrypted </span><a id="_idIndexMarker313"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.904.1">storage, unattached disk volumes, underutilized instances, missing access logs, reliability gaps, and keys that have not been rotated for over a year. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.904.2">This shows we either operate reactively due to time constraints or have not adopted best practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.904.3">The first one could mean that we do not have mature risk management procedures and ownership definitions in place, such as an operating model, and a RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) matrix that shows responsibilities, accountability, and who needs to be consulted or informed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.904.4">The second possible reason, a lack of best practice adoption, is another sign that training is required and that the team needs to be given time to implement these best practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.904.5">Quite often, a combination of both </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.905.1">reasons </span></span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker314"/></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.906.1">applies.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.907.1">We have explored internal indicators, the problems they cause, and how to remediate them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.907.2">Recovering from these problems can take a long time, depending on the company’s size, degree of sprawl, and complexity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.907.3">It is important to continuously look out for these indicators. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.907.4">But there are also some external indicators for this anti-pattern, and we will go through </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.908.1">them next.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.909.1">External indicators</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.910.1">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker315"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.911.1">following signals are potentially provided by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.1">third parties:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.913.1">Significant finding in audits</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.914.1">: Audits reveal many remediation-required findings, including least privilege approach gaps and vulnerabilities in containers and virtual machines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.914.2">The root causes are the same as those as the findings surfaced by an advisory tool, such as a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.915.1">CNAPP solution.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.916.1">Over-relying on penetration tests</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.917.1">: Penetration tests include findings that could have been avoided with a mature DevSecOps culture, such as out-of-date images, lack of network security controls, or installed malware because we are exposed to supply chain attacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.917.2">This indicates we have not addressed practices such as vulnerability scanning in our DevSecOps culture and CI/CD toolchain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.917.3">This is usually not a technology issue, since most CSPs offer that service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.917.4">It is very likely a sign that more DevSecOps upskilling </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.918.1">is required.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.919.1">Partner feedback</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.1">: A CSP or software vendor provides feedback that we are not utilizing the tool enough or correctly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.2">We need a functional relationship with the third party for them to be honest enough with their feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.3">The feedback from the CSP could be that our virtual machine uptake needs to be lowered if we have a serverless strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.4">This can be a sign that our serverless strategy has not been communicated well or that our teams don’t know how to write serverless applications and would rather run apps in the traditional way on virtual machines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.5">A vendor might provide feedback if we have a committed spend and significantly underutilize the tool. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.6">One of my previous customers had a committed spend for security and compliance SaaS products but they only utilized 10 % of the license volume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.7">The reason was that only the people who initiated the purchase knew how to leverage the tool but left shortly after the purchase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.8">Luckily, the vendor reached out, and we were able to run some training sessions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.9">This </span><a id="_idIndexMarker316"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.921.1">helped with the tool ramp-up and creating visibility of the current maturity level for compliance </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.922.1">and security.</span></span></li>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.934.1">Panic-driven partner selection</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.935.1">In a previous role, I worked</span><a id="_idIndexMarker317"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.936.1"> for an organization that had a tiny cloud platform team, considering the cloud native ambitions they had. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.936.2">Let’s refer to them as the customer to distinguish between the consultancy and the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.936.3">The customer relied heavily on a cloud consultancy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.936.4">The local consultancy has less than 500 employees and operates only in a small part of Asia Pacific. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.936.5">Their consultants are highly skilled, have a wealth of cloud native knowledge, and contribute to the community via meetup talks, conference presentations, and blog posts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.936.6">They have won several AWS partner awards and have demonstrated true dedication. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.936.7">They could operate with little guidance, were productive, applied best practices, and were always willing to transfer knowledge or work in a team-augmentation approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.936.8">The small cloud consultancy was a great cultural fit and understood the customer’s business objectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.936.9">They also had all the required </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.937.1">technology expertise.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.938.1">Later, the customer had two on-premises outages within a year. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.938.2">Because of service-level agreement breaches, they had to pay penalties for the outages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.938.3">Additionally, those outages received media attention, which added </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.939.1">more pressure.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.1">Only 25% of the applications ran in the cloud, and the majority were hosted on-premises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.2">The leadership team brought in one of the big global consultancies to investigate resilience issues across the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.3">The international firm was known for its expertise in process design and management consulting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.4">The international global consultancy started with on-premises analysis and design recommendations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.5">Unfortunately, once the global consultancy commenced the cloud discovery workshops, the budget for the local cloud consultancy was repurposed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.6">The giant consulting firm tried reusing slides that were previously used for businesses 20 to 50 times the size of the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.7">The slides were very generic and did not address the customer context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.8">During the first cloud workshops with the new partner, it became apparent that their cloud experience could not match expectations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.9">The experience gaps were significant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.10">The majority of their consultants were very on-premises focused. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.940.11">The people who had some cloud experience were graduates who only had very little time to learn from errors </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.941.1">and anti-patterns.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.942.1">The recommendation </span><a id="_idIndexMarker318"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.943.1">slides produced after the discovery phase did not reflect reality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.943.2">The chosen language was ambiguous. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.943.3">The consultancy did not understand the current automation and compliance gaps, which became obvious during the play-back sessions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.943.4">When we (the customer) tried to clarify misunderstandings, we realized the consultancy did not understand the fundamental concepts of cloud native. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.943.5">We agreed that the cloud team needed to be pulled into the review process earlier to improve the quality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.943.6">The consultancy brought in more consultants to capture detailed requirements in the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.944.1">engagement phase.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.945.1">We had review sessions where there were 2 members from the cloud team and 12 from the consultancy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.945.2">The consultancy produced design artifacts that were missing a majority of compliance and security requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.945.3">After a while, some team members of the customer’s cloud team spent 50% of their time reviewing and providing feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.945.4">The mentality of the consultancy </span><a id="_idIndexMarker319"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.946.1">was very different compared to the previous strategic cloud consultancy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.946.2">Their behavior was passive, and their main driver was to move stories from “in progress” to “done” on the Jira board. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.946.3">The quality was so low that it did not add value, and the cloud team spent more time hand-holding the consultants to get the quality to an acceptable level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.946.4">After 6 months, 25% of the intended scope was delivered. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.946.5">It was an exhausting experience and negatively impacted the motivation of team members. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.946.6">This anti-pattern is avoidable if we choose the right vendor for the suitable problem space. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.946.7">Choosing the right partner requires some planning and collection of data points to see how the velocity can improve over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.946.8">But those things do not happen if we make </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.947.1">reactive decisions.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.948.1">You snooze, you lose</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.949.1">Another common variation of the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.950.1">lack of partnership</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.951.1"> anti-pattern is being in a passive mode instead of a proactive mode. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.951.2">That typically happens when we do not have a cloud migration strategy and want to grow our cloud presence organically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.951.3">As a consequence, we don’t gain momentum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.951.4">The migration approach will be slow, as we already covered in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.952.1">lack of migration strategy</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.953.1"> anti-pattern. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.953.2">Because of that, we will not invest enough time and budget into strategic relationships. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.953.3">When this happens, we might have all required license agreements in place, but we are not necessarily using the tools and platforms correctly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.953.4">We are probably also not focusing on building enough cloud native knowledge within our organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.953.5">We don’t have regular collaboration sessions with our partners. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.953.6">We will miss out on the training that our teams could get. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.953.7">We will also not receive valuable feedback or leverage the partner for reviews. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.953.8">All those things will hold us back. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.953.9">Let’s summarize the benefits of strategic partnerships to make sure we </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.954.1">leverage them.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.955.1">The value of strategic partnerships</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.956.1">A partnership is a mutual </span><a id="_idIndexMarker320"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.957.1">relationship. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.957.2">Partners will want to help us since they want a successful customer story, too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.957.3">What are we missing out on if we do not build strong </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.958.1">strategic partnerships?</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.959.1">Partners can help us with a training plan, training sessions, and lab environments so that our team members can follow the instructor for more hands-on experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.959.2">With a functioning partnership, we can leverage </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.960.1">those benefits.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.961.1">If we don’t have a strong relationship with our partners, they won’t provide valuable feedback to improve and be more effective in our working methods. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.961.2">Partners have seen many customer stories and seen first-hand what has gone wrong and what worked. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.961.3">They want to help us because a customer’s success also means they have a good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.962.1">customer story.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.963.1">We will not receive roadmap insights, which can be helpful to avoid building up technical debt and avoiding bespoke solutions if we know there will be an out-of-the-box </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.964.1">feature soon.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.965.1">We will also not receive the support we need. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.965.2">The turnaround time for questions we ask will be slower than desirable, or the quality might be lower because stronger relationships get </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.966.1">more attention.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.967.1">Our innovation will not be as accelerated as it could be if we have a partner who can speed up transformations and ensure we use best practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.967.2">The latter might also impact security </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.968.1">and reliability.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.969.1">Other areas for improvement could be a lack of cost efficiencies that an SME (subject matter expert) from the partner could spot or slower support response times because we are not on a premium partnership contract. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.969.2">AWS, Azure, and GCP have different response times depending on the support level we choose. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.969.3">A higher support level also comes with a higher cost; we must assess </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.970.1">the benefits.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1193.1">After comparing the different CAFs, two things </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1194.1">become apparent:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1195.1">First, cloud adoption is complex, and there is much to consider. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1195.2">That is why some aspects of a CAF are often forgotten, resulting in an incomplete picture of our cloud adoption journey. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1195.3">Therefore, we might forget or insufficiently address aspects such as training, cultural impact, or change management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1195.4">Those are common reasons why cloud adoption initiatives fail and need to be relaunched. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1195.5">That is not only a costly exercise but also can lead to people leaving the organization because of frustrations that are beyond </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1196.1">their control.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1197.1">Second, this chapter has already examined areas within the scope of a CAF, including strategy, learning, and the consequences of a lack of cloud knowledge, including governance gaps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1197.2">In </span><a href="B22364_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1198.1">Chapter 1</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1199.1">, we also examined some cultural aspects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1199.2">Therefore, we will now focus on two strategic anti-patterns that we have not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1200.1">discussed yet.</span></span></li>

<ol>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1206.1">The cloud adoption is initiated bottom-up. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1206.2">The leadership team understands it brings great opportunities but does not get involved in governance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1206.3">However, enough rigor is in place to ensure that common frameworks, CI/CD tools, and programming languages </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1207.1">are used.</span></span></li>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1224.1">A team member fixed the issue by releasing the latest tested version, and the application performed stable again. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1224.2">Luckily this could be fixed within minutes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1224.3">During a root cause analysis, the team found that a build artifact from the development environment had somehow been released </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1225.1">to production.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1226.1">Everyone thought they </span><a id="_idIndexMarker368"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1227.1">were practicing good environment promotion, which meant build artifacts could only be deployed to the next higher environment after testing it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1227.2">We could only deploy a build artifact from development to the test environment, not to UAT or production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1227.3">It turned out the guardrails were not in place to enforce the use of predefined workflows that validate environment promotion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1227.4">A new team joiner was unaware of this best practice and set up a custom CI/CD pipeline for the deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1227.5">We </span><a id="_idIndexMarker369"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1228.1">cannot blame the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1229.1">new joiner.</span></span></li>
