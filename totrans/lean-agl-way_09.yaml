    staying competitive and relevant requires the ability to swiftly adapt and innovate
    to meet and exceed customer expectations. How can organizations not just survive
    but thrive amid constant change? This chapter introduces the **Business Agility
    System for the Enterprise** (**BASE**), a model designed to transform uncertainty
    into opportunity. The BASE drives continuous improvement by coordinating all facets
    of a company’s resources to enhance business processes, systems, products, and
    services.

    of organizational capabilities, behaviors, and ways of working that grant businesses
    the freedom, flexibility, and resilience to achieve their purpose*.” Similarly,
    **SAFe**® defines business agility as “*the ability to compete and thrive in the
    digital age by swiftly responding to market changes and emerging opportunities
    with innovative, digitally-enabled* *business solutions*.”

    to product development. Within the BASE model, Lean’s flow-oriented practices
    improve productivity, efficiency, and quality, while Agile’s timeboxed practices
    help organizations implement a hypothesis-driven approach to innovation, value
    delivery, and digital transformation. The BASE coordinates the activities of multiple
    **Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams** (**BLASTs**) to deliver new increments of
    value on cadence. This approach involves continuous cycles of information gathering,
    informed decision-making, and experimentation to optimize outcomes with available

    business agility. An operating model is a comprehensive framework that defines
    how an organization operates to deliver value to its customers and achieve its
    strategic objectives. It encompasses the organization’s structure, processes,
    systems, and culture, detailing the alignment of resources, technology, and workflows
    to support its goals.

    changing and often unpredictable stages a product goes through from concept to
    market release to end of life. This dynamism can be due to many factors, such
    as evolving customer needs, technological advancements, market competition, regulatory
    changes, and customer feedback during development. BASE aims to deliver new customer
    value perpetually, provided it is economically viable to continue supporting the
    product or service.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A BASE solution typically starts as a **minimal viable product** (**MVP**).
    Organizations should initially explore new product or service concepts by developing
    an MVP to design, build, and test a limited set of planned features, functions,
    and capabilities, and then test them with your customers and in the market. The
    MVP helps evaluate the product’s potential and assesses its viability through
    fast feedback from one or more customer segments in the target market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The BASE implements value streams that deliver new increments of business value,
    starting with an initial MVP followed by a series of **minimum viable increments**
    (**MVIs**), as illustrated in *Figure 9**.1*. Each MVI iteratively and incrementally
    enhances a business process, information system, a product, or a service, offering
    customers increased benefits over time. This leads to a higher perceived value
    and often provides a competitive advantage in the market.

    in business processes, systems, or other business-enabling artifacts that the
    organization uses to improve its operations. These changes compete for the organization’s
    limited resources; therefore, business priorities must be assessed alongside enhancements
    to products and services as part of the business value backlog. This is why we
    prefer the term “value manager” over “product owner” for the person responsible
    for managing the business value backlog.

    Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams (BLASTs)*, MVIs often fail to provide a complete
    solution or may not warrant individual deployment due to cost considerations.
    Additionally, introducing partial features, functions, or incomplete processes
    could negatively affect customer satisfaction. Therefore, the BASE conceptual
    model also incorporates the concept of a **minimum viable release** (**MVR**)
    to synchronize the rollout of new functions, features, and processes on a regular
    cadence.

    loop where each positive action leads to further enhancements and benefits. In
    this context, it means that improvements in one area of the business drive further
    improvements across the enterprise, creating a cycle of ongoing enhancement and
    value creation.
  prefs: []

    its target market and in marketing to attract more customers who will value its
    products and services. As the customer base grows, product development budgets
    increase, allowing further investment in customer-centric product enhancements
    and related promotional and sales strategies, resulting in even higher revenue
    and growth. This cyclical process never stops across the life cycles of our products
    and services. In this example, note how we have kept the customer front and center
    to ensure we stay on track with our investments and work to meet their needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This never-ending loop results in benefits that increase the positive effect
    of the next item in the loop. Every core virtuous circle activity affects the
    ability of the value streams to deliver customer-centric value. Consequently,
    skipping any virtuous circle activity affects the organization’s ability to deliver
    value through value streams that create products and services. A BASE enterprise
    ensures that its strategy and governance apply a Lean and Agile mindset, principles,
    and practices to achieve business agility. It enables the enterprise to move quickly
    and safely and adapt to change. The BASE is also built on two core principles.

    development that combines scientific methodology with Agile practices. At its
    core, it emphasizes the importance of formulating and testing hypotheses about
    user needs, behaviors, and product features before committing significant resources
    to development. Hypothesis-driven development is a structured process where assumptions
    about product features or user needs are rigorously tested. It begins with identifying
    key assumptions and converting them into clear, measurable statements. Metrics
    are defined to measure success, and experiments such as prototypes or A/B tests
    are designed and executed to gather data. The outcomes of these experiments are
    analyzed to confirm or refute the initial assumptions. Based on the findings,
    decisions are made to either scale successful solutions or refine and retest.

    the organization’s vision, mission, goals, objectives, and priorities. Activities
    include assessing the products and services the organization can deliver, its
    target customers, and how the organization can uniquely and profitably deliver
    value.

    and governance policies. Chief executives establish governance policies to ensure
    organizational accountability, ethical conduct, and strategic alignment, fostering
    trust and sustainable success. Additionally, chief executives are accountable
    for aligning business unit activities with corporate goals and objectives and
    making critical business decisions. The establishment of OKRs is a key tool for
    this alignment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, the executives should communicate a new set of OKRs in cadence with
    each BASE increment. **Objectives and Key Results** (**OKRs**) is a goal-setting
    framework used by organizations to define and track objectives and their outcomes.
    OKRs work by setting clear, measurable goals (Objectives) and specifying key results
    (Key Results) that indicate progress toward achieving those goals. Objectives
    are ambitious and qualitative, while Key Results are specific, quantitative, and
    time-bound, providing a clear metric for success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The typical recommendation for OKRs is to set 3-5 Objectives per organizational
    level (e.g., company, division, department), each with 3-5 Key Results. This keeps
    the focus manageable and ensures that each Objective receives adequate attention.
    OKRs are usually set and reviewed quarterly, allowing for regular assessment and
    adjustment while maintaining alignment with longer-term annual goals.

    BASE, the portfolio management function oversees these investments and other significant
    initiatives to achieve the organization’s strategic objectives and maximize portfolio
    value. Chief and Line of Business (LoB) executives determine the funding level
    for each portfolio and agree on spending for investment themes developed through
    collaboration between senior portfolio leaders and enterprise executives. These

    managers orchestrating pre-cycle planning sessions. BLAST teams define tasks and
    activities, and resolve inter-team dependencies. Throughout each BASE cycle, traditional
    Lean and Agile metrics are monitored to track progress, maintain visibility and
    ensure timely issue resolution. Simultaneously, the lead value manager collaborates
    with product managers, marketing managers, and portfolio managers to plan upcoming
    increments.

    Shortest Job First (WSJF) serves as a powerful prioritization tool in Agile and
    Lean environments. By calculating a score based on **Cost of Delay** (**CoD**)
    and job duration, WSJF helps teams determine which backlog items to tackle first
    for maximum economic benefit. This method ensures that high-value tasks, which
    deliver results quickly and incur significant costs if delayed, are given precedence.
    WSJF aligns with Lean principles by focusing on maximizing value, disregarding
    sunk costs, and continuously optimizing economic decisions. It’s a vital compass
