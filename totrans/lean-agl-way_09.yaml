    staying competitive and relevant requires the ability to swiftly adapt and innovate
    to meet and exceed customer expectations. How can organizations not just survive

- en: The BASE model supports the dynamic nature of the product life cycle — the continuously
    changing and often unpredictable stages a product goes through from concept to
    market release to end of life. This dynamism can be due to many factors, such
    as evolving customer needs, technological advancements, market competition, regulatory
    changes, and customer feedback during development. BASE aims to deliver new customer
    value perpetually, provided it is economically viable to continue supporting the
    product or service.

    的目标是持续不断地提供新的客户价值，前提是继续支持该产品或服务在经济上是可行的。
- en: A BASE solution typically starts as a **minimal viable product** (**MVP**).
    Organizations should initially explore new product or service concepts by developing
    an MVP to design, build, and test a limited set of planned features, functions,
    and capabilities, and then test them with your customers and in the market. The
    MVP helps evaluate the product’s potential and assesses its viability through
    fast feedback from one or more customer segments in the target market.

    有助于评估产品的潜力，并通过来自一个或多个目标市场的客户群体的快速反馈来评估其可行性。
- en: The BASE implements value streams that deliver new increments of business value,
    starting with an initial MVP followed by a series of **minimum viable increments**
    (**MVIs**), as illustrated in *Figure 9**.1*. Each MVI iteratively and incrementally
    enhances a business process, information system, a product, or a service, offering

- en: As noted in the previous paragraph, an MVI can also focus on implementing changes
    in business processes, systems, or other business-enabling artifacts that the
    organization uses to improve its operations. These changes compete for the organization’s
    limited resources; therefore, business priorities must be assessed alongside enhancements
    to products and services as part of the business value backlog. This is why we
    prefer the term “value manager” over “product owner” for the person responsible
    for managing the business value backlog.
  id: totrans-20

  zh: 正如前段所述，MVI也可以专注于实施业务流程、系统或其他业务支持工件的变更，这些变更竞争机构有限的资源；因此，业务优先事项必须与产品和服务增强一起作为业务价值积压的一部分进行评估。这就是为什么我们更倾向于将负责管理业务价值积压的人称为“价值经理”而不是“产品负责人”。
- en: As discussed in [*Chapter 8*](B21818_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378), *Implementing
    Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams (BLASTs)*, MVIs often fail to provide a complete
    solution or may not warrant individual deployment due to cost considerations.
    Additionally, introducing partial features, functions, or incomplete processes
    could negatively affect customer satisfaction. Therefore, the BASE conceptual
    model also incorporates the concept of a **minimum viable release** (**MVR**)
    to synchronize the rollout of new functions, features, and processes on a regular
    cadence.

    and related promotional and sales strategies, resulting in even higher revenue
    and growth. This cyclical process never stops across the life cycles of our products

    value through value streams that create products and services. A BASE enterprise

- en: '**Hypothesis-driven development** (**HDD**) is a powerful approach to product
    development that combines scientific methodology with Agile practices. At its
    core, it emphasizes the importance of formulating and testing hypotheses about
    user needs, behaviors, and product features before committing significant resources
    to development. Hypothesis-driven development is a structured process where assumptions
    about product features or user needs are rigorously tested. It begins with identifying
    key assumptions and converting them into clear, measurable statements. Metrics
    are defined to measure success, and experiments such as prototypes or A/B tests
    are designed and executed to gather data. The outcomes of these experiments are
    analyzed to confirm or refute the initial assumptions. Based on the findings,
    decisions are made to either scale successful solutions or refine and retest.
    This iterative approach ensures continuous learning and data-driven decision-making
    in product development. This approach allows teams to make data-driven decisions,
    reduce risk, and create products that truly meet user needs.'

    of a product that can effectively test core hypotheses about its value proposition.
    It contains just enough features to gather meaningful feedback from early adopters
    or potential customers. The primary goal of an MVP is to validate or invalidate
    key assumptions about the product’s market fit, user needs, and potential success
    with minimal investment of time and resources. By releasing an MVP, teams can
    quickly learn from real-world usage and adjust their product strategy accordingly.'

    tangible value to the user or the business.'

    MVIs are employed throughout the product's development life cycle to continuously

    fosters closer alignment between development efforts and business objectives.
    By consistently delivering value in small, measurable increments, teams can demonstrate
    progress more effectively to stakeholders and adjust course quickly when needed.

    Lean environments. By calculating a score based on **Cost of Delay** (**CoD**)
    and job duration, WSJF helps teams determine which backlog items to tackle first
    for maximum economic benefit. This method ensures that high-value tasks, which
    deliver results quickly and incur significant costs if delayed, are given precedence.
    WSJF aligns with Lean principles by focusing on maximizing value, disregarding
    sunk costs, and continuously optimizing economic decisions. It’s a vital compass

    different business functions and value streams. For instance, within Corporate
    Strategy and Portfolio Management, dedicated BLASTs may focus on vision development,
    strategic planning, performance management, and risk mitigation aligned with specific
    value streams. Similarly, Product and Marketing Management functions can form
    BLASTs to manage market intelligence, strategic decision-making, product development,
    market introduction, and sales support activities that drive value creation across
    their respective value streams.

    integrated increments of value, presented as MVPs, MVIs, and MVRs, within a single
    BASE cycle (i.e., one loop of its Virtuous Circle). Some MVIs may be released
    independently, while others contribute to larger MVRs. The flexibility of the
    BASE model allows organizations to adjust the number of integrated increments
    released per cycle based on their size and complexity. Larger organizations typically
    require multiple BLAST Teams to effectively manage and synchronize these processes,
    ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with customer-centric goals.

    a philosophy but a guiding principle that informs every facet of operations. Customer
    Care, as the front line of customer interaction, extends far beyond mere post-purchase
    services. It involves a comprehensive suite of activities to ensure ongoing customer
    satisfaction and loyalty. These activities include providing timely support and
    assistance, actively soliciting feedback, addressing customer concerns, and identifying
    opportunities for product or service improvement. Organizations can cultivate
    strong relationships and foster long-term loyalty by maintaining open lines of
    communication and demonstrating a genuine commitment to meeting customer needs.

    services. This involves various initiatives such as outreach programs, reward
    schemes, and conversational AI technologies designed to capture insights into
    customer preferences, satisfaction levels, and areas for improvement. Additionally,
    activities such as customer journey mapping provide a structured approach to understanding
    the end-to-end customer experience, enabling organizations to identify moments

    or service that requires improvements. During initial planning, keep your BASE
    processes defined at a high level, allowing your BLAST teams to delve into the
    details of how to enhance value delivery. If your organization encompasses multiple
    product lines—distinguished not merely by variations in make or model but by genuinely
    different products or services—each should undergo a dedicated BASE cycle to drive
    improvements in processes, products, and related services.
