    position of the role on the organizational structure and envision where it ideally
    should be. Think about this from a value stream perspective. If the person’s role
    was originally defined in a traditional hierarchical structure, but their responsibilities
    support a specific value stream, their focus and responsibilities will change.

    – physical or electronic – following a linear format. This format combines the
    BRIA and QIDA formats, and is essential for categorizing questions and their related
    information. Participants then delve into each question, spending roughly 10 minutes
    elucidating the rationale behind their queries to the larger group. This thorough
    explanation of the *Questions, Information, Decisions*, and (optional) *Actions*

    available, relevant, and accurate. In their approach, Quarrio’s software integrates
    **Natural Language Understanding** (**NLU**) capabilities and a user interface
    that appears to offer functionalities similar to **Generative Pre-trained Transformer**
    (**GPT**) and **Large Language Model** (**LLM**) tools such as ChatGPT. However,
    their underlying mechanisms operate in distinctly different ways.
  id: totrans-220
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    utilizing **machine learning** methodologies for pre-training on extensive and
    varied digital data and linguistic resources within datasets. Subsequently, it
    undergoes fine-tuning to accommodate specific tasks related to information retrieval.
    In the realm of machine learning, a prevalent objective involves developing algorithms
    capable of learning from data and making predictions. This can be termed a **bottom-up
    approach**, where the machine looks for patterns in large amounts of data to create
    pattern recognition and prediction.
  id: totrans-221
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, Quarrio adopts a multi-level **semantic grammar** approach, also
    known as a **symbolic** approach, to information retrieval. This method diverges
    from the probabilistic pattern recognition of models such as ChatGPT by instructing
    computing systems about the semantics – meaning of words and phrases – and the
    grammar rules of natural languages such as English.
  id: totrans-222
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quarrio’s approach addresses a fundamental challenge in NLU systems, commonly
    referred to as an “AI-hard” problem, which Quarrio is tackling. Quarrio’s software
    operates on a **top-down approach**, utilizing a grammatical simulation to precisely
    interpret user requests and generate SQL queries, in contrast to the probabilistic
    methodologies employed by models such as GPT and other LLMs, which rely more on
    statistical inference. This emphasis on accuracy and precision is particularly
    valuable in regulated industries or functions where these qualities are critical,
    ensuring that outcomes meet stringent regulatory standards.
  id: totrans-223
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This distinction is crucial; unlike approaches that rely on probabilistic guesswork
    to interpret user queries, Quarrio leverages the user’s natural language input
    to dynamically generate a SQL query. This method ensures that the query retrieves
    and displays information from trusted data sources, directly relevant to the user’s
    request. The output follows a **deterministic pattern**, meaning it produces consistent
    and predictable results every time, which can be crucial in environments requiring
    high reliability and traceability.
  id: totrans-224
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, the deterministic nature of the output allows for thorough validation
    through audit trails and other methods. This ensures consistency and accuracy
    in the information retrieval process. Furthermore, both users and DBMS experts
    have the option to toggle a feature on or off to see how the user’s sentences
    were interpreted and the SQL queries it generated. This feature enhances the system’s
    transparency and assures users of the accuracy of the results.
  id: totrans-225
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, a significant challenge with symbolic tools such as Quarrio is the
    potential for ambiguity, as different industries, domains, and even individual
    users may interpret the same or similar language terms differently in specific
    contexts. To address this, Quarrio utilizes a *multi-level grammar architecture*
    designed to incorporate these variances and has developed a configuration tool
    that enables non-technical users to map language terms and business concepts to
    their specific uses within the domain’s data stores. This strategy ensures accurate
    mapping of terms to concepts and effective information retrieval. Ultimately,
    the precision of the retrieved information depends solely on the organization’s
    data and its repository of domain-specific semantic mappings.

    approaches; in fact, it’s quite the opposite. GPT/LLM-based tools rely on statistical
    inference and are fundamentally probabilistic. This means that, at best, they
    can achieve high levels of accuracy but can never be completely precise. Nor will
    they return the same result predictably.

    where they generate nonsensical, irrelevant, or even misleading responses. This
    phenomenon can occur due to various factors, including a lack of context, ambiguity
    in the user’s language, biases in training data, and limitations in the model’s
    understanding of semantic meanings.

- en: Users often cannot detect when GPT-based AI tools *hallucinate* unless the errors
    are obvious, and the opaque nature of these systems complicates understanding
    how responses are generated. Consequently, while useful for general queries, GPT-based
    tools should not be used for critical decision-making or automating vital business
    processes without external checks.
