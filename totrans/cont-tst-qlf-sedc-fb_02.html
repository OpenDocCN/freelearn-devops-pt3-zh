			<p><st c="1895">As defined by Marc Hornbeek in </st><em class="italic"><st c="1927">Engineering DevOps</st></em><st c="1945"> (self-published with Bookbaby in 2019), the nine pillars of DevOps represent fundamental principles and practices that are essential for the successful implementation of DevOps in an organization. </st><st c="2143">Each pillar plays a unique role in supporting and enhancing the DevOps philosophy, which focuses on improving collaboration, automation, and the overall efficiency of software development and delivery. </st><st c="2345">Here’s an explanation for each of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2379">these pillars:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="2393">Leadership</st></strong><st c="2404">: Effective leadership</st><a id="_idIndexMarker130"/><st c="2427"> is crucial for driving the cultural and organizational change required for DevOps. </st><st c="2511">Leaders must advocate for DevOps principles, facilitate collaboration across departments, and ensure that teams are equipped with the necessary tools and training. </st><st c="2675">They play a key role in breaking down silos and fostering an environment that</st><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/><st c="2752"> supports continuous improvement </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2785">and innovation.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="2800">Collaborative culture</st></strong><st c="2822">: DevOps emphasizes a culture of collaboration and communication </st><a id="_idIndexMarker132"/><st c="2888">between software developers, IT operations, and other stakeholders in the software delivery process. </st><st c="2989">A collaborative culture involves shared responsibilities, transparency, and open communication, which are essential for rapid and efficient development, testing, and deployment </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3166">of software.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3178">Design for DevOps</st></strong><st c="3196">: This involves </st><a id="_idIndexMarker133"/><st c="3213">designing software and systems in a way that supports DevOps practices. </st><st c="3285">It includes considerations such as modularity, scalability, and maintainability. </st><st c="3366">The design should facilitate easy updates, quick deployments, and efficient operation, aligning with the principles of automation </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3496">and CD.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3503">Continuous integration (CI)</st></strong><st c="3531">: CI is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker134"/><st c="3539"> the practice of </st><a id="_idIndexMarker135"/><st c="3556">frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. </st><st c="3618">Each integration is verified by an automated build and testing process to detect integration errors as quickly as possible, thereby reducing integration problems and improving </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3794">software quality.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3811">Continuous testing</st></strong><st c="3830">: Continuous testing</st><a id="_idIndexMarker136"/><st c="3851"> involves the </st><a id="_idIndexMarker137"/><st c="3865">execution of automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline. </st><st c="3937">This ensures that software quality is maintained throughout the development process, allowing teams to identify and address issues early, and enabling faster and more reliable </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4113">software releases.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4131">Elastic infrastructure</st></strong><st c="4154">: Elastic infrastructure</st><a id="_idIndexMarker138"/><st c="4179"> refers to the ability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand. </st><st c="4261">In a DevOps context, this means using virtualized and cloud-based services </st><a id="_idIndexMarker139"/><st c="4336">and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4340">infrastructure-as-a-service</st></strong><st c="4367"> technologies, which</st><a id="_idIndexMarker140"/><st c="4387"> allow for the flexible allocation of computing resources, supporting the rapid and efficient deployment and operation </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4506">of applications.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4522">Continuous security</st></strong><st c="4542">: Continuous security, or DevSecOps, integrates security practices into every step of the software </st><a id="_idIndexMarker141"/><st c="4642">development</st><a id="_idIndexMarker142"/><st c="4653"> and deployment process. </st><st c="4678">It involves continuous monitoring for security threats, regular vulnerability assessments, and the integration of security controls into the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4819">CI/CD pipeline.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4834">Continuous delivery (CD)</st></strong><st c="4859">: CD is </st><a id="_idIndexMarker143"/><st c="4868">a software engineering </st><a id="_idIndexMarker144"/><st c="4891">approach where teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that it can be reliably released at any time. </st><st c="5001">It aims to build, test, and release software with greater speed and frequency, reducing the cost, time, and risk of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5117">delivering changes.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5136">Continuous monitoring</st></strong><st c="5158">: Continuous monitoring</st><a id="_idIndexMarker145"/><st c="5182"> involves the </st><a id="_idIndexMarker146"/><st c="5196">ongoing collection, processing, and analysis of data (performance metrics, logs, etc.) from software applications and infrastructure. </st><st c="5330">This practice helps in proactively identifying and addressing issues, understanding system performance, and ensuring that the system operates reliably </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5481">and efficiently.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="5497">Together, these nine pillars form a comprehensive framework for implementing and optimizing DevOps practices. </st><st c="5608">They encourage a holistic approach to software development and delivery, focusing on collaboration, automation, continuous improvement, and a high</st><a id="_idIndexMarker147"/><st c="5754"> degree of operational efficiency. </st><st c="5789">By integrating these practices, DevOps aims to shorten the development cycle, enhance software quality, and increase the frequency of releases, thereby responding more quickly to market demands and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5987">user needs.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="5998">The nine pillars of DevSecOps practices</st></h3>
			<p><st c="6038">DevSecOps extends </st><a id="_idIndexMarker148"/><st c="6057">the DevOps model by integrating security practices into all DevOps pillars. </st><st c="6133">This strategy emphasizes that security should not be an afterthought but a key component of the development process. </st><st c="6250">DevSecOps seeks to embed automated security checks and balances within the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that security considerations are addressed continuously and do not slow down the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6431">delivery process.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6448">As defined by Marc Hornbeek in </st><em class="italic"><st c="6480">Engineering DevOps</st></em><st c="6498">, the nine pillars of DevOps also apply to DevSecOps. </st><st c="6552">While the pillars are the same, the specific practices under each of the pillars complement each other. </st><st c="6656">The nine pillars of DevSecOps ensure that security is not a standalone element but is seamlessly embedded into every stage of the software development and delivery pipeline. </st><st c="6830">Here are explanations for each of these pillars </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6878">of DevSecOps:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="6891">Leadership</st></strong><st c="6902">: Strong leadership</st><a id="_idIndexMarker149"/><st c="6922"> is crucial in driving the cultural shift necessary for the successful integration of security into DevOps practices. </st><st c="7040">Leaders must champion security as a core value, ensuring it is prioritized at every level of the organization and that teams have the resources and support they need to implement </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7219">DevSecOps effectively.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="7241">Collaborative culture</st></strong><st c="7263">: A culture of </st><a id="_idIndexMarker150"/><st c="7279">collaboration is essential in DevSecOps, where development, operations, and security teams work closely together. </st><st c="7393">This collaboration ensures a shared understanding and responsibility for security, enabling faster and more effective identification and resolution of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7544">security issues.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="7560">Design for DevOps</st></strong><st c="7578">: This involves designing systems and applications with both DevOps and </st><a id="_idIndexMarker151"/><st c="7651">security considerations in mind. </st><st c="7684">It includes building with modularity, scalability, and security from the start, ensuring that systems are both agile </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7801">and secure.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="7812">Continuous integration (CI):</st></strong><st c="7841"> In DevSecOps, CI </st><a id="_idIndexMarker152"/><st c="7859">includes integrating code changes frequently and </st><a id="_idIndexMarker153"/><st c="7908">ensuring each change is automatically tested for security issues. </st><st c="7974">This approach helps in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities early in the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8062">development process.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8082">Continuous testing</st></strong><st c="8101">: Continuous testing in DevSecOps extends beyond functionality and </st><a id="_idIndexMarker154"/><st c="8169">performance</st><a id="_idIndexMarker155"/><st c="8180"> to include regular, automated security testing. </st><st c="8229">This ensures that security is continuously validated at every stage of the software development </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8325">life cycle.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8336">Elastic infrastructure</st></strong><st c="8359">: Elastic infrastructure</st><a id="_idIndexMarker156"/><st c="8384"> in DevSecOps emphasizes the ability to rapidly scale resources in response to varying demands while maintaining security. </st><st c="8507">It involves using cloud services and virtualization, with version and flexible configuration controls that support both operational flexibility and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8655">security requirements.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8677">Continuous security</st></strong><st c="8697">: Continuous security</st><a id="_idIndexMarker157"/><st c="8719"> is at the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker158"/><st c="8729"> heart of DevSecOps. </st><st c="8750">It involves integrating security practices into every phase of the software development and deployment process, from initial design through to operation, ensuring ongoing monitoring </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8932">and compliance.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8947">Continuous delivery (CD)</st></strong><st c="8972">: In the context of </st><a id="_idIndexMarker159"/><st c="8993">DevSecOps, CD entails a process where code changes are automatically</st><a id="_idIndexMarker160"/><st c="9061"> built, tested (including security testing), and prepared for release to production, ensuring that software can be deployed at any time with </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9202">high security.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="9216">Continuous monitoring</st></strong><st c="9238">: This</st><a id="_idIndexMarker161"/><st c="9245"> involves constantly</st><a id="_idIndexMarker162"/><st c="9265"> monitoring the deployed software and underlying infrastructure for security threats. </st><st c="9351">Continuous monitoring enables rapid detection and response to security incidents, vulnerabilities, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9450">and anomalies.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="9464">Each of these pillars plays a vital role in embedding security into the DevOps pipeline, ensuring that security considerations are an integral and ongoing part of the development and </st><a id="_idIndexMarker163"/><st c="9648">deployment process. </st><st c="9668">Together, they form a comprehensive framework for implementing DevSecOps effectively, aligning security with the fast-paced and agile nature of modern </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9819">software development.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="9840">Alignment of DevOps and DevSecOps</st></h3>
			<p><st c="9874">Both DevOps </st><a id="_idIndexMarker164"/><st c="9887">and DevSecOps</st><a id="_idIndexMarker165"/><st c="9900"> share the common goal of facilitating CD but approach it with different emphases: DevOps prioritizes efficiency and speed, while DevSecOps prioritizes security within that </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10073">fast-paced environment.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="10096">While it is feasible (and there are unfortunately many industry examples of this) to implement DevOps without DevSecOps, there are concerns </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10237">with this:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="10247">Security as an afterthought</st></strong><st c="10275">: In a pure DevOps approach, the focus on speed and efficiency might lead to security being overlooked or tacked on at the end of the development process. </st><st c="10431">This can result in vulnerabilities being introduced into the software, potentially leading to security breaches and deploys when vulnerabilities found late in the pipeline need to be fixed, integrated, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10633">and verified.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="10646">Reactive rather than proactive security</st></strong><st c="10686">: Without integrating security into the CD pipeline, organizations may find themselves reacting to security incidents post-deployment, which can be costly and damaging to the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10862">organization’s reputation.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="10888">Compliance risks</st></strong><st c="10905">: A lack of emphasis on security may lead to non-compliance with industry regulations and standards, particularly in sectors where data protection and privacy </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11065">are crucial.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="11077">Increased vulnerability to cyber threats</st></strong><st c="11118">: CD without continuous security can make software products more vulnerable to emerging cyber threats, as security measures may not keep pace with the rapid deployment of updates and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11302">new features.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="11315">A fragmented approach to risk management</st></strong><st c="11356">: Separating development and security efforts can lead to a fragmented approach to risk management, where security considerations are not adequately integrated into the decision-making process </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11550">during development.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="11569">In summary, while DevOps and DevSecOps both aim to facilitate Continuous Delivery, the integration</st><a id="_idIndexMarker166"/><st c="11668"> of security from the outset – as emphasized in DevSecOps – is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker167"/><st c="11730"> crucial to ensure that the speed and efficiency gains of DevOps do not compromise the security and integrity of the software being delivered. </st><st c="11873">Thus, a holistic approach that combines the principles of both DevOps and DevSecOps with a common framework of nine pillars is essential for a balanced, efficient, and secure software </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12057">delivery pipeline.</st></span></p>
