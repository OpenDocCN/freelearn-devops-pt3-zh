			<p class="author-quote">“Success today is not about surviving change; it’s about leading it.” – Peter Drucker</p>
			<p>Imagine your organization as a vast communications network, coordinating work, information, and resources from initial ideas to final outcomes, from requests to deliveries. As business and IT professionals, your success hinges on managing these complex flows efficiently to support customer journeys and drive business outcomes. How do you ensure that these processes run smoothly across <span class="No-Break">your organization?</span></p>
			<p>Managing these disparate pieces of work requires more than a single value stream—it demands coordinated efforts across streams aligned with <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Value Stream Networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">VSNs</strong>) are<a id="_idIndexMarker474"/> interconnected pathways within your organization that are strategically aligned to deliver holistic value. VSNs show how work items flow through multiple value streams while supporting a broader network that serves our business, stakeholders, and <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<p>The seamless flow of work and information across this network maximizes the value delivered through products and services. However, these interconnections can introduce complexities, constraints, and potential waste that must be managed effectively. The network’s ability to create value depends on maintaining reliable, scalable, and <span class="No-Break">efficient operations.</span></p>
			<p>Even if individual value streams are streamlined, their interconnected nature and constant evolution introduce complexities. This chapter presents strategies to manage <span class="No-Break">these complexities.</span></p>
			<p>A VSN can function to some degree without visualization and measurement. However, without a visual representation of the value stream network, the organization will struggle to <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>improve workflows and risk local optimizations that may have detrimental <span class="No-Break">side effects.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter covers the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Managing and optimizing value <span class="No-Break">stream networks</span></li>
				<li>Visualizing <span class="No-Break">organizational workflows</span></li>
				<li>Guiding value stream strategies <span class="No-Break">and investments</span></li>
				<li>Evolving the value <span class="No-Break">stream network</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>Managing and optimizing value stream networks</h1>
			<p>Value stream networks, as <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>defined by Mik Kersten in his book <em class="italic">From Project to Products</em>, refer to a holistic approach that captures and analyzes the movement of work within an organization<span class="superscript">1</span>. Value stream networks provide a holistic view of an organization by illustrating how people, processes, information, and technology integrate to optimize customer value delivery. This approach helps shift mindsets from project-based thinking to a product-centric and <span class="No-Break">customer-focused perspective.</span></p>
			<p>VSNs foster collaboration <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>among teams and processes, ensuring<a id="_idIndexMarker478"/> efficient value delivery across the organization. At their core, they facilitate the progression of value from inception to delivery, encompassing interactions, handoffs, and dependencies among various teams. For instance, when you order a product online, multiple teams—from design and development to fulfillment and marketing—collaborate to ensure its <span class="No-Break">successful delivery.</span></p>
			<p>Dynamic and responsive, VSNs evolve continually in response to software updates, market shifts, and budget adjustments, requiring ongoing adaptation for sustained effectiveness. Drawing on principles akin to graph theory, which studies the connections (edges) between points (nodes) in a network, they navigate diverse pathways across teams, offering insights beyond traditional hierarchical <span class="No-Break">organizational charts.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding VSNs is essential for grasping the intricate network that drives organizational efficiency and value delivery. It transcends organizational charts, offering a deeper understanding of how ideas translate into <span class="No-Break">tangible outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>Integrating multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker479"/> value streams within VSNs serves several <span class="No-Break">key objectives:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">End-to-end visibility and coordination</strong>: Organizations gain a holistic view of how work and information flow across different departments, functions, and processes, enhancing coordination toward common <span class="No-Break">business objectives</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Optimization of value delivery</strong>: By identifying and eliminating inefficiencies, organizations optimize the speed and efficiency of value delivery <span class="No-Break">to customers</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cross-functional collaboration</strong>: VSNs promote collaboration among diverse teams, breaking down silos and improving problem-solving capabilities <span class="No-Break">and innovation</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement</strong>: Supporting a culture of continuous improvement, organizations analyze processes, gather insights, and implement changes to enhance performance and adapt to <span class="No-Break">market demands</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer-centricity</strong>: Integrating value streams helps organizations align activities with customer needs, enhancing satisfaction <span class="No-Break">and loyalty</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While often associated with Lean-Agile methodologies in software development, VSN principles apply broadly across various industries that employ Lean’s value <span class="No-Break">stream concepts:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manufacturing</strong>: Optimizing material flows and <span class="No-Break">production processes</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Healthcare</strong>: Streamlining patient care and payer processes for <span class="No-Break">better outcomes</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Supply chain management</strong>: Enhancing inventory management <span class="No-Break">and responsiveness</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service industries</strong>: Improving customer service processes <span class="No-Break">and satisfaction</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Government and non-profit sectors</strong>: Enhancing service delivery and efficient <span class="No-Break">resource allocation</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In essence, value stream networks drive operational efficiency, promote collaboration, foster continuous improvement, and enhance customer-centricity across diverse sectors beyond <span class="No-Break">software development.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>Organizing value stream networks</h2>
			<p>In this subsection, we <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>will look at how value stream networks are applied within an organization. Instead of visualizing our network as a shapeless web, we’ll anchor it to one or more customer journeys, highlighting its proximity to the customer and depicting the focus of its activities to either development or operations. Additionally, we can simulate and hypothesize the effects of changes in measurement, operating model, and strategy for each stream, as well as <span class="No-Break">the network.</span></p>
			<p>Adopting a value stream network model for software delivery includes all the tasks that are necessary to produce software, as well as the integration of people, processes, information, and technology as enabling capabilities that support the  software development lifecycle and across all value stream flows. This model covers the entire end-to-end process, from the initial idea or customer request through development, testing, deployment, and <span class="No-Break">ongoing support.</span></p>
			<p>But value stream networks are not just about connecting software development activities. As you navigate this chapter, you will discover the importance of connecting all value streams to support our customers' journeys. In turn, we align our software delivery streams to assist in the improvement of all operational, development, and support value streams. Value stream management provides the methods and tools we use to identify and prioritize our <span class="No-Break">improvement activities.</span></p>
			<p>Before diving into the network, let’s review the value stream model as a reference for flow and value delivery. We’ll begin with <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>, which depicts the value stream <span class="No-Break">network visualized.</span></p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.1 – The value stream network visualized</p>
			<p>Value stream networks represent a transformative paradigm that transcends conventional organizational structures. For example, this holistic model integrates people, processes, information, and technologies that produce capabilities  across an interconnected virtual organization to optimize holistic flow, as shown in <span class="No-Break">this figure.</span></p>
			<p>These networks <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>provide a panoramic view of an organization’s workflow, fostering continuous improvement and the seamless delivery of value to customers. By defining them, we’re better able to plan, discuss, and diagnose opportunities for performance improvement. In the sections that follow, we’ll delve further into the fundamental principles of Value Stream Networks and their application in contemporary software <span class="No-Break">delivery processes.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Defining customer journeys</h2>
			<p>Customer journeys have <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>become a popular method to consider value delivery from the customer’s perspective and an invaluable reference for product management in recent decades. Customer journeys can be mapped, measured, and used to drive customer and outcome-centric conversations. They serve as an excellent reference point for technology leaders to engage business leaders on common ground. It’s also a far more valuable context than mapping the network with a strictly internal or <span class="No-Break">isolated scope.</span></p>
			<p>The business exists to create value for customers, while the customer journey provides a common foundation for teams and organizations as they begin to embrace the concept of value streams. It offers an outside-in, customer-centric perspective and a visual tool for understanding value delivery from the customer (or business outcomes) backward to an idea <span class="No-Break">or request.</span></p>
			<p>It’s crucial to recognize the distinction between customer journeys and a value stream. The customer journey, as depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em>, is mostly beyond the organization’s influence. It takes place at the borders of the organization, where customers interact with products and services. Its path is primarily determined by customers, which may limit the organization’s ability to fully influence or <span class="No-Break">optimize it.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer081">
					<img alt="Figure 7.2 – An illustration of a typical customer journey" src="image/B21818_07_02.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.2 – An illustration of a typical customer journey</p>
			<p>For example, consider two customers: one is referred to a product by a friend and buys it immediately. The other discovers our company’s products or services through advertising, investigates alternatives, gets distracted by other needs, and only returns to purchase when timing, needs, and cost align. If these two scenarios were viewed through the lens of value streams, they would have dramatically different paths and attributes. Lead times for these scenarios would be significantly different. Furthermore, there are insufficient mechanisms for measuring work in process, value-added time, or percent complete and accurate for customer interactions. Customer journeys are typically measured by sentiment, probability of purchase, cost of acquisition, conversion rate, order size, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, organizations have significant control over how their value stream operates. While they cannot dictate customer actions, they can implement standardization and automation to facilitate improved flow. Key metrics such as lead time, value-added time, throughput, quality, and work in process are essential. Organizations can guide work through a value stream much more effectively than they can direct a <span class="No-Break">customer’s journey.</span></p>
			<p>The customer journey<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> serves as a foundation for understanding value streams because without it, value streams have no clear direction or focus. They also have no clear connection to other streams in the network. With the customer journey anchoring flow, we can connect value streams to demonstrate how they motivate and support the customer journey at <span class="No-Break">critical touchpoints.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, a marketing campaign value stream aids in a customer’s discovery and knowledge, potentially leading to a sale, while the sales and purchase processes—streamlined through easy-to-use systems such as checkouts or shopping carts—represent separate value streams that culminate in the purchase. This means that when we experience an issue with the customer journey, we can trace it directly to the contributing value streams. Now, let us discuss how we can visualize the proximity of our value stream to <span class="No-Break">our customers.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>Visualizing value stream proximity to customers</h2>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em> illustrates a<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> fundamental aspect of value<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> stream classification: the proximity of various streams to the customer. For instance, at the top of the chart are mobile applications, which directly reach and benefit external customers. At the lower end of the spectrum, billing is listed as a value stream primarily benefiting the organization by enabling mobile banking applications. You can also think of this spectrum as external to internal focus, where proximity to customers defines where streams are placed along <span class="No-Break">this dimension.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer082">
					<img alt="Figure 7.3 – Visualizing value stream proximity to customers" src="image/B21818_07_03.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.3 – Visualizing value stream proximity to customers</p>
			<p>At the lower end of the spectrum lies a function such as billing—an internal process that is essential to the organization but invisible to the customer. These internal value streams are no less critical, as they support the external offerings. However, their purpose is more internally focused, dealing with operations that keep the organization running smoothly, such as reconciliation and <span class="No-Break">procurement processes.</span></p>
			<p>Displaying value<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> streams as a spectrum provides <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>clarity on where the end user’s interactions and satisfaction are paramount, such as mobile banking applications, and those with an internal operational focus, such as billing, which ensure the efficiency and stability necessary to support <span class="No-Break">customer-facing services.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> shows how the network begins to appear in service of a <span class="No-Break">customer journey:</span></p>

			<p>The product use<a id="_idIndexMarker488"/> phase is directly linked to a <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>product development value stream. Afterward, the review and recommendation stages can be bolstered by additional supportive value streams. The primary value stream, product development, can be so influential that it propels customers through the entire journey. However, other supportive value streams play a vital role by facilitating each stage of the journey, making it smoother for customers to transition from one phase to <span class="No-Break">the next.</span></p>
			<p>As we explore the relationship between customer experience and value streams, the next section will delve into the concept of the customer journey. Understanding this dynamic framework is essential in using value streams to navigate and enhance the customer <span class="No-Break">journey effectively.</span></p>
			<p>In the following section, we will further explore the pressing challenges faced by organizations, emphasizing the need for a strategic approach to streamlining value <span class="No-Break">stream networks.</span></p>
			<h3>Connecting value streams to customer journeys</h3>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker490"/> journey of a given customer is an individualized<a id="_idIndexMarker491"/> path that often eludes the direct control of an organization. It starts with an innate need or want, sparking curiosity that leads to the discovery of a product or service. As customers move through various stages such as sale, purchase, use, and review, they follow a course that is inherently personal and self-directed. The customer journey can be envisioned as a series of interconnected experiences, each potentially influenced by different value streams within <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em> depicts an<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> enterprise <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) customer journey. It starts with campaign exposure to make <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>customers aware of a product via <a id="_idIndexMarker494"/>marketing efforts, so that they then try the product in a limited capacity, choose to purchase it, and progress through the customer experience. The figure demonstrates how each stage of the customer journey is supported by value streams consisting of planning, designing, building, validating, and releasing activities to ensure a seamless and engaging <span class="No-Break">customer experience.</span></p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.5 – Connecting value streams to the customer journey</p>
			<p>The visualization of this journey lays the foundation for understanding how value streams operate and directly impact customer outcomes in a Lean-Agile organization. By orchestrating work across value streams, we create significant opportunities for refinement and optimization. Through standardization and automation, organizations can shape these value streams to effectively support the <span class="No-Break">customer journey.</span></p>
			<p>At the outset, a marketing campaign value stream plays a pivotal role in triggering the customer’s journey from initial curiosity to product use, product sales, and support. By allowing the customer to trial a product or service, it sets the stage for a potential sale. The journey then transitions into more tactical value streams, such as the sales process, where streamlined systems such as intuitive checkouts or shopping carts facilitate the <span class="No-Break">purchase phase.</span></p>
			<p>The product development value stream becomes especially crucial as it aligns with the use phase of the customer journey. It is here that the quality and features of the product come to the forefront, influencing the customer’s direct experience and satisfaction. Subsequent stages, such as review and recommendation, may be enhanced by other supportive value streams focused on customer engagement <span class="No-Break">and loyalty.</span></p>
			<p>Ultimately, while the <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>primary value stream of product<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> development enables the customer to complete their journey, the importance of the supporting value streams cannot be understated. They are the threads that weave through the customer’s experiences, ensuring that each transition is seamless and each interaction is meaningful. Together, these value streams form a spectrum that not only defines but also enriches the <span class="No-Break">customer’s journey.</span></p>
			<h3>Harnessing flow within the value stream network</h3>
			<p>Value <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>is not just an abstract concept; it is delivered tangibly as benefits through our products and services. Once it has been quantified or qualified, value can be delivered, and its creation and delivery are influenced by improving the supporting value streams. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> graphically reveals the interconnected nature of value streams that underpin our business operations, from the operational level right through to <span class="No-Break">customer delivery.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer085">
					<img alt="Figure 7.6 – Value stream network example" src="image/B21818_07_06.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.6 – Value stream network example</p>
			<p>In this graphic, the<a id="_idIndexMarker498"/> Customer Success Agent plays a vital role in ensuring that customers can achieve their desired outcomes with a company’s products or services. They provide onboarding support, ongoing assistance, and proactive engagement, building strong relationships, advocating for customer needs, and offering training to maximize product value. This person helps drive customer satisfaction, retention, and <span class="No-Break">long-term success.</span></p>
			<p>This visual representation illustrates how each value stream—whether its focus is operational or developmental—interacts and contributes to the overall value delivered to the customer. It’s a network of value creation, where each flow of work, materials, information, and resources is orchestrated to support and enhance <span class="No-Break">the others.</span></p>
			<p>In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em>, we can see each interdependent value stream plotted based on its proximity to external customers (vertical axis) and its performance focus (horizontal axis). We can see the interdependence of streams either producing or consuming capabilities and services delivered by others. By zooming in on each stream, we can see the individual activities performed and teams involved in delivering a specific product, service, or capability. To anchor this holistic visualization of value creation and delivery, we can see every component connected to the <span class="No-Break">customer journey.</span></p>
			<p>Although it’s possible to visualize an entire organization this way, there is diminishing value in including aspects that are unrelated to the current target objective, so it’s important to map the network relative to what is currently most important. For example, if the goal is to increase the sales of a particular product, we can visualize the customer journey to increase sales and understand where that product connects to the journey. We can look upstream to the marketing streams enabling the journey, as well as further into the network where internal streams support the product’s development and delivery. </p>
			<p>Returning to <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em>, we can see that there’s currently insufficient investment in driving recommendations, which could have a major impact on sales. This figure serves as a practical model for understanding the flow of value throughout an organization. As we progress through this section, we will delve into how these value streams can be optimized and adapted based on current customer requirements. As we integrate the network view into our organizational strategy of VSM, we pave the way for a more profound application of flow principles at a larger scale and greater impact. This not only enhances specific aspects of organizational performance but also allows us to maintain a <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>holistic view of flow acros<a id="_idTextAnchor361"/><a id="_idTextAnchor362"/>s <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p>In the subsection that follows, we will explore the pressing challenges faced by organizations, emphasizing the need for taking a strategic approach to streamlining value <span class="No-Break">stream networks.</span></p>
			<h3>Addressing organizational challenges</h3>
			<p>Most organizations face the <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>daunting task of improving efficiency and quality while managing a growing backlog of identified improvement opportunities. These challenges are interconnected and tackling them requires a strategic approach that hinges on optimizing <span class="No-Break">operational flow.</span></p>
			<p>In the following list, we will explore the <span class="No-Break">work involved:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Achieving more with available resources</strong>: Businesses need to achieve better outcomes with the resources they have as they scale and compete. This means streamlining processes, eliminating waste, and leveraging technology to enhance their ability to deliver the most value. Mapping the value stream network starting with customer outcomes, we can re-engineer flow to emphasize what is most critical to value creation and minimize non-value-added activity, problematic dependencies, <span class="No-Break">and waste.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Elevating quality standards</strong>: Quality cannot be compromised in the quest for efficiency. Organizations must find ways to enhance their quality control processes, such as building quality to ensure that the products or services delivered meet or exceed customer expectations. By mapping dependencies and the full flow of activities to outcomes across the organization, we can gain insight into which efforts will have the greatest impact on delivered quality. We can zoom in on details and zoom out to see <span class="No-Break">interconnected impacts.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhancing value delivery</strong>: The goal here is to provide more value to customers, which could be achieved through innovative solutions, better service, or more responsive support. Companies must continuously evolve to meet and anticipate customer needs. By incorporating the customer journey in our network map, we can gain the ability to more closely attribute efforts and investments to identify the greatest impacts on customer value, whether those be upstream or downstream, and at what proximity to the customer <span class="No-Break">they are.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fostering talent satisfaction</strong>: Keeping <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>employees happy is essential for maintaining a creative, innovative, and efficient workforce. This involves creating a work environment that supports and encourages employee growth and satisfaction. By providing a holistic representation of value creation and delivery across the organization, we can ensure that contributors can see how their work adds value, connect their efforts to business objectives, and understand their work in the context of <span class="No-Break">customer outcomes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accelerating throughput</strong>: The need for speed is ever-present. Organizations must refine their workflows to deliver products and services faster without sacrificing quality. Visualizing interdependent flows of work enables understanding why certain streams are under- or over-utilized, as well as where the constraints causing bottlenecks are. We can identify critical and centralized capabilities and ensure that <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>they operate at optimal performance in the <span class="No-Break">long term.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Implementing a methodical approach to tackling flow challenges is crucial. By identifying the<a id="_idIndexMarker503"/> constraints <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>within processes and employing principles such as the <strong class="bold">theory of constraints</strong>, <strong class="bold">Lean flow</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Lean metrics</strong>, businesses<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> can systematically address these issues to create a more efficient and effective flow of work that drives value creation and delivery. Putting this interconnected work in the context of value, customers, and business outcomes facilitates a greater focus on what matters to the organization and its <span class="No-Break">long-term success.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor363"/>Visualizing organizational workflow</h2>
			<p>Visualizing and plotting the<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> organization at <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>varied levels allows us to consider the organizational structure and flow of work from different perspectives. In this section, we will explore these rel<a id="_idTextAnchor364"/>ationships <span class="No-Break">more thoroughly.</span></p>
			<p>We will start by reviewing <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em>, where we can see that value stream networks represent the macro view at the top, team topologies in the middle, and the organization’s value chain capabilities at the bottom. <em class="italic">Team Topologies</em> is a framework that categorizes software delivery teams into four types: Stream-aligned, Enabling, Complicated-Subsystem, and Platform teams. This approach helps organizations structure their teams for optimal flow, clarity, and collaboration in delivering <span class="No-Break">software solutions.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> illustrates the organization’s delivery structure, from the overarching end-to-end processes to the specific interconnection of value chain capabilities and components. This multi-layered approach helps clarify the varying scales of detail involved in a value stream network, allowing us to pick the right level of detail to match our objective <span class="No-Break">and audience:</span></p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.7 – Visualizing organizational flow</p>
			<p>This visualization<a id="_idIndexMarker508"/> underscores the<a id="_idIndexMarker509"/> importance of recognizing the different layers within the organization’s workflow. This multi-faceted approach is instrumental for leaders and teams to navigate and optimize the organization’s value stream <span class="No-Break">network effectively.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll delve deeper into this diagram in the subsections <span class="No-Break">that follow.</span></p>
			<h3>Value stream network (top level)</h3>
			<p>At the top level, we can see the big <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>picture of the value stream network, which encapsulates the <em class="italic">macro</em> perspective of how work is delivered within the organization. This is the broadest view, where the focus is on how value streams connect holistically from start to finish without delving into the details of individual components or <span class="No-Break">technical dependencies.</span></p>
			<h3>Team topologies (middle level)</h3>
			<p>Moving to the middle level of the <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>visualization, we encounter team topologies, a model that outlines how teams within the organization are structured and how they interact. This level zooms in from the end-to-end flow to <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>show the topology of teams, such as <strong class="bold">stream-aligned teams</strong> working <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>alongside <strong class="bold">complicated-subsystem teams</strong>, and supported<a id="_idIndexMarker514"/> by <strong class="bold">platform teams</strong> that provide <span class="No-Break">foundational services.</span></p>
			<p>Team topologies, as defined by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais in their 2019 book <em class="italic">Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow</em>, are concepts in organizational design and software delivery.<span class="superscript">2</span> These topologies describe how teams are structured and interact within an organization to optimize workflow, reduce bottlenecks, and enhance collaboration. Skelton and Pais provide valuable insights into how various team types, such as stream-aligned teams, complicated-subsystem teams, and platform teams, can be organized to support an organization’s goals and facilitate efficient <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></p>
			<p>Beyond mere structure, they define three interaction <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>modes —<strong class="bold">Collaboration</strong>, <strong class="bold">X-as-a-Service</strong>, and <strong class="bold">facilitation</strong>—to make the connections between teams explicitly<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> defined<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> operating models.<span class="superscript">3</span> In the context of VSM, an <strong class="bold">operating model</strong> can be thought of as a blueprint that outlines how an organization <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>delivers value to its customers, manages its resources, and <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>achieves its <span class="No-Break">strategic goals.</span></p>
			<p>By establishing clarity on how teams interact, we can avoid many of the pitfalls of siloed operations where handoffs (the baton) of the value stream “relay race” are dropped, delayed, <span class="No-Break">or fumbled.</span></p>
			<h3>Value chain capabilities (bottom level)</h3>
			<p>At the bottom (or micro) level, the <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>graphic delves into the specifics of the capabilities and components that compose and contribute to delivered value. This level of detail is where individual features and functions are identified and examined for their contribution to the customer journey, from the initial concept to the final delivery <span class="No-Break">and support.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor365"/>Guiding value stream strategy and investments</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Wardley map</strong> in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.8</em> provides a <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>visual tool that helps organizations understand their business <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>environment and strategize accordingly. It helps us answer the question “Where should we invest?” and, to a lesser extent, “How can we <span class="No-Break">deliver?”</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript"> 4</span></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>This map consists of two <span class="No-Break">main components:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value chain (y-axis)</strong>: This shows<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> the components needed to meet user needs, from visible user-facing components to hidden infrastructure. A component is any element or part of a system (or value chain) that contributes to delivering a product or service to the <span class="No-Break">end user.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Evolution (x-axis)</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/>indicates the stages of evolution of each component, ranging from genesis (novel and uncertain) to commodity (ubiquitous and well-defined). A value chain is the series of activities that comprise the life cycle of a product or service, from genesis through production to purchase by the <span class="No-Break">end customer.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In our use case, we <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>are evaluating whether we should invest in an AI-based imaging tool to improve our <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer087">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.8 – Wardley helps answer where to invest and how to deliver</p>
			<p>This map will help our organization answer strategic questions, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Which components should we focus on developing <span class="No-Break">or outsourcing?</span></li>
				<li>Which components are mature and should <span class="No-Break">be commoditized?</span></li>
				<li>Where should we invest <span class="No-Break">in innovation?</span></li>
				<li>How can we anticipate changes in our <span class="No-Break">competitive landscape?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By visualizing these elements and their relationships, organizations can make more informed decisions about resource allocation, innovation, and competitive positioning. It’s a valuable tool for strategic planning, particularly in technology and <span class="No-Break">business contexts.</span></p>
			<p>By mapping the interconnected capabilities of an organization with customer needs, this framework provides a comprehensive overview that balances the importance of innovation with the inevitability <span class="No-Break">of commoditization.</span></p>
			<p>At the heart of our <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>Wardley map are elements that are critical to supporting customer needs, such as online image manipulation and photo storage, plotted against the axes of value chain and evolution. The value chain axis illustrates whether the value is visible to customers, while the evolution axis shows the journey from unique genesis to <span class="No-Break">standardized commodities.</span></p>
			<h3>Strategic investment decisions</h3>
			<p>As capabilities evolve <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>toward commoditization, the organization must decide where to allocate resources to drive innovation and maintain competitiveness. Our map suggests strategic investment areas in <strong class="bold">Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) image manipulation, shown<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> in the red rectangle, which highlights a potential point for enhancing the customer journey or improving efficiency and inertia in <span class="No-Break">platform capabilities.</span></p>
			<p>Wardley charts help identify potential investment opportunities by mapping key capabilities and activities along an evolution axis from an idea to a commodity product. Assess the maturity of each component against industry standards, engage stakeholders for insights, and regularly update positions to reflect changes in the industry, technology, and customer needs. This process provides a clear visual representation of your organization’s capabilities, aiding in strategic planning and identifying areas for innovation <span class="No-Break">and growth.</span></p>
			<h3>Orchestrating strategic architecture</h3>
			<p>The assembly <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>of services such as compute or online storage is depicted not just in their relation to the customer but also in their architectural context by their interdependence with other capabilities and components. By mapping out these services, the organization can scrutinize its investment strategy, identifying both strengths <span class="No-Break">and opportunities.</span></p>
			<h3>Aligning strategy and operations</h3>
			<p>Although a<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> Wardley map is valuable for defining where to invest, it does not illustrate how capabilities are produced and consumed. The value stream network defines how each capability is produced and consumed by different value streams and identifies <span class="No-Break">their intersection.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em> shows the integration of value stream and value chain visualizations to depict the what, why, and how of our value-based investments. These combined visualizations not only illustrate where our investments should be directed but also provide insight into their purpose <span class="No-Break">and execution.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.9 – Combining value stream and value chain visualizations</p>
			<p>In this graphic, we can see the various capabilities that are used by value streams in the network. To align with our objective, we could define the capabilities from both a producer and consumer perspective, establishing direct connections between capabilities and <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>Having seen how the<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> Wardley map integrates with the value stream network to provide strategic direction, it’s now time to delve into the finer details of our organizational workflow, visualizing both macro and micro perspectives within our <span class="No-Break">organization’s processes.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor366"/>Evolving the value stream network</h1>
			<p>As organizations evolve, they <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>increasingly seek a comprehensive understanding of their operational dynamics and how to influence them. Combining the axes<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> of <strong class="bold">Customer Proximity</strong> and <strong class="bold">Performance Focus</strong> allows <a id="_idIndexMarker534"/>leaders to pinpoint each value stream’s position relative to its visibility to customers and its performance, as illustrated in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.10</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>For example, value streams such as mobile banking are visible to customers and require metrics that are focused on customer satisfaction such as net promoter score (NPS) and customer engagement. These are the front-facing elements of the business where innovation and responsiveness to customer needs <span class="No-Break">are paramount.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer089">
					<img alt="Figure 7.10 – Balancing efficiency and innovation performance focus" src="image/B21818_07_10.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.10 – Balancing efficiency and innovation performance focus</p>
			<p>Conversely, back-office<a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> processes such as billing are invisible to customers and reside in the efficiency range of performance focus. These activities are measured against standards of operational excellence and the metrics include cost, standardization, predictability, and consistency. The strategic considerations for these processes might include the potential for outsourcing to external providers, streamlining operations, or automating to <span class="No-Break">reduce costs.</span></p>
			<p>This dynamic model provides insights into how changes in one area—such as the introduction of FinOps or the automation of platforms—can ripple through the network, affecting adjacent streams. The integration of new capabilities into a value stream such as mobile banking raises questions about adaptation. For example, how should mobile banking adapt to the introduction of automated FinOps platforms? What are the potential impacts on customer experience, and what new efficiencies or innovations <span class="No-Break">might emerge?</span></p>
			<p>The implications for behavior and strategy are profound. Each connection, each node on this map, represents a decision point—a place where the balance between innovation and efficiency, between customer-facing actions and back-end processes, must be carefully managed to maintain an effective value stream network. Understanding these connections and the alignment of internal processes with overarching organizational goals is crucial for <span class="No-Break">strategic agility.</span></p>
			<p>The value stream network is not static; it embodies the potential for movement, reflecting an organization’s strategic flexibility. A compelling example of this dynamism is the evolution of <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>). What began as an internal infrastructure program to support <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>Amazon’s operations transformed AWS from an internal capability to an external value stream. This change underscores the significance of measuring and valuing various aspects of the value stream over time, aligning with opportunities and realizing <span class="No-Break">new value.</span></p>
			<p>Organizations must <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>understand where their value streams are positioned and how they can be improved over time. There are many benefits of such strategic movements, from delivering value to customers and optimizing internal processes to maintaining a competitive edge. By understanding and managing this evolutionary path, organizations can unlock new opportunities and create value in ways that were not <span class="No-Break">possible before.</span></p>
			<p>This type of evolution has an impact on our value stream networks, as they, too, must transition. We’ll explore this concept in the <span class="No-Break">next subsection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor367"/>Improving value streams by performance focus</h2>
			<p>The decision to <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>improve with sustaining innovation may lead to a reorganization of existing value streams, which should be a deliberate and thoughtful process of evolution rather than a radical disruption. This approach can reduce waste and political risks, as well as leverage existing expertise <span class="No-Break">and capabilities.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.11</em> illustrates the adaptation of a value stream by performance focus, highlighting the shift from innovation to an <span class="No-Break">efficiency focus.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer090">
					<img alt="Figure 7.11 – Adapting value streams by performance focus" src="image/B21818_07_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.11 – Adapting value streams by performance focus</p>
			<p>For many <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>organizations, disruptive innovation—starting afresh with no legacy constraints— is strong. However, this approach often requires significant investment and comes with its own set of risks. Alternatively, by incrementally shifting how an existing process such as billing operates, organizations can evolve their value streams to achieve different, often more innovative outcomes without discarding the underlying systems and processes that have served <span class="No-Break">them well.</span></p>
			<p>This shift involves a conscious decision to move away from established measures and behaviors toward new goals. For example, a billing system traditionally focused on efficiency might begin to incorporate more innovative approaches such as adopting new technologies or modifying workflows to improve the customer experience, automation, or performance. These changes can lead to a more dynamic and responsive billing process that still retains the core advantages of the existing system, such as reliability <span class="No-Break">and predictability.</span></p>
			<p>This transition is about adapting to new environments and challenges while retaining what has proven successful. To be clear, this is the evolution of the operating model, not technology or capability. Leaders, therefore, need to focus on understanding and defining the new metrics that will measure success. By redefining these metrics, the organization encourages behaviors that drive innovation within the context of established <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, by intentionally shifting existing value streams, organizations can find a middle ground that achieves the best of the sustaining and disruptive innovation approaches. In turn, this<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> allows for the evolution of services and processes in a way that is both innovative and grounded in the proven foundations of <span class="No-Break">the past.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor368"/>Envisioning value stream dynamics</h2>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.12</em> again shows a<a id="_idIndexMarker541"/> two-dimensional canvas that allows us to plot streams relative to each other and their <span class="No-Break">touchpoint activities.</span></p>

					<img alt="Figure 7.12 – A simplified network of interconnected value streams" src="image/B21818_07_12.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.12 – A simplified network of interconnected value streams</p>
			<p>Specifically, this diagram depicts a simplified network of interconnected value streams and illustrates the critical nature of <span class="No-Break">these connections.</span></p>
			<p>At the heart of this network lie customer-facing products, such as mobile banking, which may draw support from related streams such as loan qualification services. The proximity of these streams to the customer (external focus) can vary depending on how directly they impact the <span class="No-Break">customer experience.</span></p>
			<p>Diving deeper, the dynamic nature of this network becomes apparent when considering the introduction of modern technologies such as<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> AI in <strong class="bold">customer relationship management</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRM</strong>). To harness AI effectively, the CRM stream might need to pivot toward innovation, prioritizing metrics that reflect this new focus. Such a shift would naturally drive different behaviors within the teams, pulling the CRM stream closer to the innovation end of <span class="No-Break">the spectrum.</span></p>
			<p>As another example, we may need to assess the experience of our internal developers who can benefit from the use of platforms or learning environments such as dojos. A <strong class="bold">dojo</strong> is a structured <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>and collaborative approach to learning that encourages experimentation, skill development, and problem-solving in a practical context. To scale this effectively across the organization, we may decide to move our value streams toward improved efficiencies, measured by the degree of standardization and the consistency of the experience provided <span class="No-Break">to developers.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding that each value stream can encompass multiple teams and functions highlights the complex nature of organizational workflows. The movement of these streams is not arbitrary but is a strategic choice made to drive evolution, leverage opportunities such as AI for enhanced customer outreach, or create efficiencies on <span class="No-Break">that scale.</span></p>
			<p>Through this lens, an <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>organization can begin to see the levers of change and the potential impacts of strategic decisions. By manipulating the metrics that define success within each stream, leaders can guide their teams toward desired outcomes, be they innovation, efficiency, or a blend of both. This approach allows for the intentional design of an organization’s value delivery mechanisms, ensuring that they remain agile and responsive to both internal imperatives and <span class="No-Break">market demands.</span></p>
			<p>The evolution of these streams is a dance of strategic repositioning, where each move has the potential to catalyze further transformation. It is this fluidity that empowers organizations to adapt and thrive in a landscape that demands both steadfast reliability and relentless innovation. However, the process of transitioning value streams often requires reorganizing organizational resources to support those transformations. Therefore, we need a way to compare the value streams in our networks. We will look at a way to do so in the <span class="No-Break">next subsection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor369"/>Evaluating value stream networks</h2>
			<p>We can evaluate <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>our value stream networks in a matrix to define key characteristics, allowing us to determine value stream needs. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.13</em> depicts a matrix view that simplifies the comparison of value streams in our network by key attributes, including value stream needs, fulfillment characteristics, network location (from front- to back-of-house), and their primary function (developmental <span class="No-Break">or operational).</span></p>
			<p>In your diagrams and<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> tables, make sure to list, sort, and annotate your streams. If you are ambitious, you might add specific metrics or objectives to each value stream to provide more detail on performance capabilities and goals. You could also define dependencies to indicate common points of leverage <span class="No-Break">or challenge.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have a way to visualize our value stream network attributes, let’s move on to learn how we can use value stream mapping to reveal and address <span class="No-Break">our constraints.</span></p>
			<div>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor370"/>Value stream mapping reveals hidden constraints</h2>
			<p>With <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>value stream mapping, our objective extends beyond tracing workflows and measuring performance; we seek to identify the hidden bottlenecks that cause inefficiencies. These critical chokepoints are often where dependencies become problematic, revealing the pivotal areas within our processes that most significantly influence the flow <span class="No-Break">of value.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.14</em> encapsulates this comprehensive analysis. It displays a detailed timeline of a process from the initial request to deployment, delineating not only the duration of each step but also the interim delays. This level of transparency is pivotal for identifying where we can gain efficiencies and identify the constraints in our <span class="No-Break">production system.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer093">
					<img alt="Figure 7.14 – Value stream mapping" src="image/B21818_07_14.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.14 – Value stream mapping</p>
			<p>Further analysis within this value stream map identifies significant delays: the active time for the environment setup process consumes approximately 71% of the total active time in this value stream. By drilling down into the activities of the environment setup process, we can gain a better understanding of the work performed. Decomposing this step into activities allows us to pinpoint the root cause or causes of delays and formulate targeted strategies <span class="No-Break">for improvement.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.14</em> also reveals how dependencies form the intricate web within our organizational framework. For instance, the environment setup process is part of a collection of collaborative activities involving the data and DevOps teams, along with critical activities such as data cloning and environment validation. Recognizing these interdependencies sheds light on the complex interactions that govern our workflows, which may be ad hoc or interrupt-driven in nature rather than streamlined <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<p>Using this map and digging deeper into flow bottlenecks for activities, we can begin to see the network beyond the value stream and the capabilities that lie even <span class="No-Break">deeper within.</span></p>
			<p>Value stream mapping acts as a lens through which the interconnected nature of cross-departmental workflows becomes apparent and the network emerges. These interdependencies often reflect areas for optimization. For example, manual processes could be automated into a more streamlined self-service workflow, boosting the value <span class="No-Break">stream’s efficiency.</span></p>
			<p>However, not every workflow identified through value stream mapping may currently represent a mature value stream. The map is likely to include potential value streams at various stages of maturity and automation. Recognizing these stages allows an organization to prioritize development efforts strategically, focusing on the areas with the most potential for refinement and automation to bolster efficiency <span class="No-Break">and value.</span></p>
			<p>Value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>mapping goes beyond identifying the current workflow. It serves as a diagnostic, enabling us to dissect and comprehend the fabric of our organizational processes. These mapping efforts guide where we can achieve the most impact, turning problems and opportunities into measurable results. So, now that we know that we can use value stream mapping to expose our constraints, let’s explore how we can eliminate them to streamline our <span class="No-Break">value flow.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor371"/>Streamlining product and platform value streams</h2>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.15</em> presents a strategic organizational framework that separates product development from platform value streams, enabling efficient decoupling and decentralization within a tech-centric <span class="No-Break">business model:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer094">
					<img alt="Figure 7.15 – Stream aligning the network view" src="image/B21818_07_15.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.15 – Stream aligning the network view</p>
			<p>The central idea revolves around the introduction<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> of a <strong class="bold">shared platform</strong> as a means of decoupling team dependencies, allowing teams to operate <span class="No-Break">more independently.</span></p>
			<p>In this example, the product <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>value streams clarify the linear sequences that cater to <strong class="bold">business-to-business</strong> (<strong class="bold">B2B</strong>) and <strong class="bold">business-to-consumer</strong> (<strong class="bold">B2C</strong>) markets, highlighting the critical phases that add value and advance the product toward<a id="_idIndexMarker551"/> market release. The platform value streams are the supporting structure providing the foundational services that are necessary for product development. They work together to promote a self-service approach, improving agility and reducing time <span class="No-Break">to market.</span></p>
			<p>Now let’s pivot away from the overarching concepts of workflow and value realization and delve into the specifics of how these concepts play out within the product and platform value streams of <span class="No-Break">an organization:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product value streams</strong>: <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 7</em></span><em class="italic">.15</em> shows two paths: B2B App G and B2C App R. These value <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>streams represent the steps required to bring products to market for business clients and individual consumers. Each step adds value and moves the product closer to <span class="No-Break">market readiness.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Platform value streams</strong>: These support the product-focused streams. They provide essential<a id="_idIndexMarker553"/> services such as design, billing, integration, data management, and compliance, enabling the smooth operation of the product <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The product value streams use the robust infrastructure from the platform value streams seamlessly. This relationship lets product teams use essential services efficiently, speeding up development and simplifying the path from concept <span class="No-Break">to customer.</span></p>
			<p>It should be clear to you by now that this book consistently focuses on delivering the most value to customers. In the next section, we’ll explore how to build a customer-centric culture within our <span class="No-Break">value streams.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor372"/>Cultivating a customer-centric approach</h2>
			<p>Stream-aligned <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/>teams function as internal customers of the shared platform offerings, while platform teams provide self-service capabilities to enhance operational flow and product development. Therefore, platform teams need to adopt a customer service mindset, elevating the quality of service and fostering a culture of excellence and <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement.</span></p>
			<p>The relationship between stream-aligned teams and platform teams is key to our shared-services model. Stream-aligned teams, acting as internal customers, use platform capabilities to improve their operations and <span class="No-Break">product development.</span></p>
			<p>In many organizations, there’s a tendency to mandate the use of specific internal software development tools and platforms. However, to avoid counterproductive effects, executive management and platform teams must commit to enabling stream-aligned teams by providing competitive service and capabilities compared to <span class="No-Break">external alternatives.</span></p>
			<p>Rather than treating platform adoption as an obligation, it is essential to approach it with a customer service mindset. Platform teams should deliver their capabilities as if they were serving external customers, ensuring a level of service that rivals or exceeds external alternatives. Alternatively, the organization may consider outsourcing this service to a specialized platform support company. In any case, where there is a customer, there is a customer journey, and care must be taken to <span class="No-Break">support it.</span></p>
			<p>By treating internal deliverables with the same care and attention as products meant for the external market, platform teams can elevate the organization’s quality of service. This motivates stream-aligned teams to engage with the platform’s offerings, contributing to the overall health of the value stream network and establishing a culture of excellence and <span class="No-Break">continuous improvement.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor373"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>We have reached the end of this chapter, where we explored how to analyze value stream networks on a two-dimensional canvas. Let’s quickly recap what <span class="No-Break">we covered.</span></p>
			<p>We learned that by detailing and evaluating value streams, we can design them better and communicate more effectively with leaders and contributors, helping them participate in the improvement journey. This chapter outlined the complex and strategic framework of value streams, showing how they integrate people, processes, information, and technology as integrated capabilities to deliver <span class="No-Break">customer value.</span></p>
			<p>The chapter emphasized the importance of optimizing these components to boost productivity, efficiency, and adaptability. It highlighted the need for agility in value stream networks, ensuring organizations can respond to customer needs and maintain a competitive edge in a changing <span class="No-Break">business environment.</span></p>
			<p>Now, we transition to <em class="italic">Part 3</em>, <em class="italic">Achieving Lean-Agile and VSM Mastery</em>. The upcoming chapters will delve deeper into practically applying Lean-Agile and VSM principles at the team of teams and enterprise levels. <a href="B21818_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a> introduces the implementation of <strong class="bold">Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Teams</strong> (<strong class="bold">BLASTs</strong>), offering insights into coordinating the efforts of multiple teams to address specific areas of work. <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a> discusses defining a <strong class="bold">Business Agility System for the Enterprise</strong> (<strong class="bold">BASE</strong>), presenting a blueprint for embedding value-directed agility across <span class="No-Break">the enterprise.</span></p>
			<p>BLAST and BASE will demonstrate how to put the concepts from the first two parts of the book into action, bridging the gap between theory and practice for transformative business practices. Specifically, you will learn how to engage multiple Lean-Agile teams to collaborate in an enterprise-wide model for continuous business transformations while maintaining a focus on delivering customer-centric value through our products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
