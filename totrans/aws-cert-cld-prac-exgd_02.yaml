    **Information Technology** (**IT**) applications for businesses across the globe.
    In the old days, you would host the entire infrastructure, hire a group of developers,
    and design each component and process required to build your applications. This
    approach not only ate into the bottom line, but also often did not follow best
    practices. It also lacked flexibility and scope for innovation.

    that comprise compute, network, storage, and software services from third-party
    suppliers, usually via the public internet or some form of direct **wide-area
    network** (**WAN**) access. Companies can provision necessary IT applications
    for their organization without having to procure and manage their own infrastructure
    to host those applications. Instead, they lease/rent the required IT infrastructure
    from such third-party providers.'

    of the internet. In the old days, Hotmail (first launched in 1996 and now branded
    as Microsoft Outlook) was a prime example of early cloud computing. You could
    set up email accounts for your colleagues and yourself on Hotmail and use them
    to communicate. An alternative would be to host your own email servers' (the infrastructure)
    network connectivity, as well as the email application (the email software). This
    would ultimately mean additional costs as well as management overheads to maintain
    the email servers you hosted.

    option for many companies and start-ups. Currently, **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**)
    is the largest provider of cloud computing services, offering a variety of cloud
    IT services in the form of infrastructure, platform, and software solutions. You
    can opt to consume these services rather than creating your own dedicated environment
    to host your business applications. The sheer size of AWS enables it to actually
    provide the necessary components to host your business applications at a fraction
    of the cost, while providing **high availability** (**HA**), security, and resilience.

    of moving to cloud computing instead of hosting your own on-premises infrastructure
    is the method of paying for that infrastructure. Traditionally, you would have
    to procure expensive hardware and invest precious business capital to acquire
    infrastructure components necessary for building an environment to host applications.'

    would generally have to pay retail rates to purchase necessary IT hardware and
    build an environment that can be used to host your applications. Cloud providers
    such as AWS, however, host infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of customers,
    and even get involved in innovating and having components manufactured to their
    specifications. This gives even greater economies of scale and allows them to
    offer lower pay-as-you-go rates to customers.'

    you would procure necessary hardware components for future growth. Predicting
    future growth is extremely difficult, and this often meant that you would overprovision
    your environment. The result would be expensive idle resources simply going to
    waste. The fact that you would have made large CAPEX to acquire those components
    would ultimately be detrimental to the balance sheet due to the rapid loss in
    value arising from depreciation. On the flip side, some companies may end up underprovisioning
    capacity to save on costs. This can have an adverse effect on corporate image,
    if—for example—due to underprovisioned resources your customers are not able to
    complete transactions or suffer from poor performance.'

    the necessary infrastructure when you need it most. Moreover, with monitoring
    and automation tools offered by cloud vendors such as AWS, you can automatically
    scale out your infrastructure as demand increases and scale back in when demand
    falls. Doing so will allow you to pay only for what you consume, when you consume
    it.

    and configure new IT resources in a few mouse clicks—for example, you can provision
    a new fleet of servers for your developers within minutes, allowing your organization
    to exponentially increase its agility in building infrastructure and launching
    applications. If you are building test and development environments or performing
    experimental work as part of researching a new product/service, then once those
    tasks are complete you can just as quickly terminate those environments. Equally,
    if a particular project is being abandoned midway, you do not need to be worried
    about having any physical wastage—you just turn off or terminate what you no longer
    need. By contrast, prior to the invention of virtualization technologies (discussed
    later), provisioning a new server to host a database would often take weeks. This
    would include the time it takes to place an order with a supplier for suitable
    hardware, having it delivered, installing additional components such as storage
    and memory, and then finally implementing the manual process of installing operating
    systems and securing them. This process of building data centers also means that

    elasticity, and the ability to provision services for their customers, usually
    within minutes.
  prefs: []

- en: Before the adoption of virtualization, if you wanted to outsource your infrastructure
    requirements, an IT services provider would have to provision physical infrastructure
    components such as a physical server for your business and grant access via the
    internet. Provisioning physical servers, however, often involves long lead times,
    from sourcing and installing all the hardware components such as the **central
    processing unit** (**CPU**), memory, and storage, to configuring an operating
    system and any necessary applications. This could mean waiting for days to have
    your environment configured.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advancement of hardware technologies such as CPUs, memory, and storage has
    seen a substantial increase in performance and capability, to the extent that
    physical servers hosting a single operating system and a few applications often
    remain idle. Software engineering and the improvements in software design have,
    by way of contrast, ensured that hardware resources are efficiently consumed to
    power those applications. The net result has been that physical hardware resources
    are rarely consumed to their maximum capability by a single operating system and
    a small set of applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This relationship between hardware and software has contributed to the invention
    of virtualization. Virtualization technologies and **hypervisors** have made it
    possible to emulate the physical hardware components of a single physical server
    as multiple virtual components. These components are then deployed as multiple
    **virtual machines** (**VMs**), each running its own operating system and suite
    of applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A hypervisor is essentially a piece of software that sits between the actual
    physical hardware and the VMs. It is responsible for enabling the operating systems
    and applications running on those VMs to access the resources of the physical
    hardware in a manner that is controlled and that isolates the resources from each
    other. The hypervisor and its associated management software are used to *carve*
    out virtualized representations of the physical hardware components into smaller
    virtual components, which are then presented as VMs. Each VM can then have its
    own operating system installed, along with any required applications.

    can be provisioned. With software being used to emulate *existing* physical hardware

    times to provision virtual servers, storage, or network environments are drastically
    reduced.

    is responsible for making it possible to deliver cloud computing services. One
    of the primary characteristics of a cloud computing provider is the ability to
    provision virtualized infrastructure resources using a self-service management
    tool. AWS offers such tools in the form of its Management Console (accessible
    via a web browser), **command-line interface** (**CLI**), and direct access to
    its software **application programming interfaces** (**APIs**), to enable customers
    to provision their resources such as servers, network, storage, and databases.
    By offering well-defined APIs and enabling automation, cloud providers have made
    it possible for customers to provision necessary resources using a *self-service*
    model. Customers do not have to wait in a queue to get their resources deployed
    while a cloud engineer performs the necessary configuration for them. Customers
    can interact with the cloud services directly using API calls, and spin up their
    own resources in a matter of minutes.

    hardware technologies that are aware of virtualization, as well as software to
    deliver shared computing resources, **Software-as-a-Service** (**SaaS**)-based
    products, and other on-demand services via the internet. In addition, providers
    such as AWS offer solutions to enable elasticity, automation, scalability, and
    HA—all on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which makes their services accessible

- en: Cloud computing today offers businesses the ability to offload the cost and
    complexity of hosting and managing their applications—for example, many providers
    offer mainstream applications as a complete service that does not require any
    kind of infrastructure management by the customer. Examples include **Microsoft
    Office 365**, which is a suite of desktop productivity applications including
    email, messaging, and collaboration services offered via the internet. At the
    same time, many organizations also need to host bespoke **line-of-business** (**LOB**)
    applications such as those developed in-house. Often, this means that they need
    access to configure the necessary infrastructure in a manner best suited to the
    needs of the application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    which offers different cloud models to suit the specific needs of the business.
    The following are three main cloud models offered by most cloud vendors such as
    AWS.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in giving the customer access and the ability to configure the underlying network,
    storage, and compute services that power their LOB applications. This model is
    very similar to owning and managing your own physical infrastructure. However,
    with cloud computing, a clear difference lies in the fact that you work with virtualized
    infrastructure components rather than having access to the underlying physical
    components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your infrastructure components need to be configured (usually from the operating
    system layer up) to support a given application.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Platform as a Service** (**PaaS**) is another cloud computing model designed
    to remove the burden of configuring and managing underlying infrastructure resources
    such as compute, storage, and network services. PaaS is designed to allow your
    organization to focus on developing your application code and offers you a *platform*
    to deploy and manage your application releases, updates, and upgrades.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As your developers deploy their application code on the PaaS environment, the
    provider provisions the infrastructure required to support the application. This
    will include the necessary network architecture, firewall rules, storage, compute
    services, operating system management, and runtime environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on your vendor, the PaaS model may still offer some degree of flexibility
    in how the underlying infrastructure is configured. AWS, for example, gives you
    the option to make necessary modifications to the underlying infrastructure, offering
    an additional level of flexibility. Example of such services include AWS Elastic
    Beanstalk, AWS OpsWorks, AWS Lambda, and Amazon **Relational Database Service**
    (**RDS**). While the PaaS model offered by AWS removes the need to minutely configure
    every infrastructure component (something you would have to do with an IaaS model),
    it still offers the flexibility of deciding just which components are deployed
    to support your application.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SaaS
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a **SaaS** model, the applications are completely hosted and managed by
    the provider. SaaS services take away any need to set up physical infrastructure
    to host an application. Instead, you simply connect to those applications via
    the internet and consume the services offered. A majority of SaaS applications
    today are fully functional via a standard web browser. This also means that there
    is no requirement to install any client software.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the need to set up and configure any infrastructure to host a SaaS application
    is solely owned and managed by the vendor, many SaaS-based applications still
    require some form of configuration to meet the specific requirements of your business.
    You will still need to either have in-house expertise to configure the application
    to your specification or get support from the provider/third parties. For example,
    Microsoft Office 365 is a SaaS-based online suite of productivity applications
    that combines email, file-share, and collaboration services. Although you do not
    need any physical hardware on premises to host the application since it is accessible
    as a complete product over the internet, you will have to configure the software
    elements to meet your business needs. This includes security configurations, configuring
    your domain name to be associated with the email services offered, or enabling
    encryption services.

    model of cloud computing due to the vast array of services on offer. Public cloud
    providers such as AWS are in the business of delivering IT services across all
    industry verticals and for businesses of all sizes.

    services from an available catalog of services.

- en: Many companies that venture into the public cloud generally start with some
    form of hybrid model. Often, businesses will move/migrate services to the public
    cloud to reduce CAPEX investment as they opt for a *pay-as-you-go* model for the
    consumption of IT services. An example of this is where companies may need to
    increase the number of servers deployed for their applications, and rather than
    procuring more expensive physical hardware, they can set up network connectivity
    between on-premises infrastructure and the public cloud provider, where they would
    spin up those additional servers as required. Connectivity options between an
    on-premises environment and a cloud provider can include setting up a secure **Internet
    Protocol Security** (**IPsec**) **virtual private network** (**VPN**) tunnel over
    the public internet, or even establishing a dedicate fiber-based connection, bypassing
    the public internet altogether and benefiting from greater bandwidth.

    (**DR**) projects, which often need network communication between the private
    cloud infrastructure and the services offered by public cloud vendors where the
    DR solution will be hosted. This enables replication of on-premises data and applications
    to the DR site, hosted with vendors such as AWS.

    technologies or adopt a phased migration approach to ensure minimum interruption
    to normal business functions while the migration is underway. In addition, HA
    solutions can also be implemented. To cite an example, if the on-premises infrastructure
    is experiencing downtime, consumers of those services can be redirected to replica
    services hosted with the public cloud provider.

    provide a brief overview of its services. We will also examine the AWS Global
    Infrastructure, which gives businesses access to globally dispersed data center
    facilities within which they can deploy their applications. This will enable businesses
    to expand their customer reach on a global scale. Then, we will look at the support
    plans offered by AWS, which are vital to any business looking to consume cloud
    services.
