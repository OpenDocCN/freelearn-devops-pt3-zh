    VSM as a methodology for prioritizing opportunities using a Lean approach. This
    chapter explores the **VSM Implementation Roadmap** from the **Value Stream Management
    Consortium** (**VSMC**)1\. The VSMC promotes value stream methods and tools for
    Lean-Agile enterprises, particularly in organizations heavily invested in digital
    technologies. They facilitate optimizing strategic investments and end-to-end
    operations, avoiding siloed decision-making. This road map enables the widespread
    deployment of the VSM methodology throughout your organization, leveraging both
    Lean and Agile concepts while aligning the technology departments to support the
    organization’s value stream improvement activities.

    has evolved to address issues associated with the conventional practice of managing
    business processes within isolated silos designed to accommodate hierarchical
    organizational structures. Too often, these hierarchies have resulted in gross
    inefficiencies, political infighting for people, funding, and other resources,
    lack of focus on customer-centricity, and an inability to evaluate investments
    holistically, let alone from a customer-centric point of view.

    value from their customers’ perspectives, transcending organizational boundaries
    and self-interests. In essence, value streams define a seamless flow of work,
    materials, information, and resources that efficiently deliver value without being
    confined by organizational boundaries. The aim of value streams is to eliminate
    waste and constraints that often lead to product delays, increased costs, and

    It embodies efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic foresight. Consequently,
    this perspective is foundational for appreciating the nuances of their VSM implementation
    roadmap. The following sections provide a detailed overview of the nine roadmap
    steps.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your VSM implementation journey begins with your current state, regardless of
    the maturity of your digital processes. At the core of each business are value
    streams and networks of value streams designed to fulfill customer needs or serve
    citizens (in government contexts). Organizations continuously innovate, develop,
    and deliver products or services regardless of their profit orientation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever there is a spark of innovation or a proposed change, it goes through
    design, development, and delivery before the customer can realize its value. Many
    organizations have long since adopted Agile methodologies, DevOps practices, or
    Lean principles. Others might be navigating through structural changes such as
    reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions. These factors do not prevent enterprises
    from adopting and driving the use of VSM methodologies and tools. Instead they
    strengthen the business case for change. However, leaders must be wary of the
    fatigue that comes with constant change. Clearly articulate the purpose and vision
    of the VSM implementation and help knowledge workers understand how their work
    contributes to the organization’s overall goals and objectives. A good purpose
    offers the why behind the change and motivates people to come along on the journey
    and to be actively engaged in its success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The typical obstacles to adopting VSM are the absence of senior leadership endorsement
    and limited resources. Forward-thinking individuals should proceed with the intent
    to course-correct rather than wait for permission, bringing leaders along in the
    process. Proactive individuals recognize that perceived resource limitations are
    often alleviated when inefficiencies are eliminated, unlocking capacity within
    the system. Still, this proactive stance does not abdicate executives from their
    duties in transforming the organization.

    more than just being at the forefront. It requires vision, empathy, and the ability

    of the organization.

    teams to handle the tactical, day-to-day decisions. Handing off decision-making

    fosters a culture of accountability, and ensures that the organization’s direction
    is shaped by diverse insights and expertise, leading to a more robust and resilient

    platforms, and their respective internal or external customers. Each value stream
    has a starting point where an idea is generated and an endpoint where value is
    delivered to the customer. It is essential to map these value streams, understand
    where they intersect and support one another, and identify dependencies.

    systematically unravel the complexities of their value streams by beginning with
    small-scale experiments and learning from them. The primary focus is on identifying
    and naming value-adding steps, identifying the customers they serve, and mapping
    out the entire journey from start to finish. Adopting this approach allows even
