			<p><st c="56">In this first chapter, we will learn how to identify when our organization is in the right state to plan a platform. </st><st c="174">For this, we will clarify why platforms have become such a relevant topic, how a product mindset fits into this, and what the checkpoints are to find out whether we are ready for a platform or not. </st><st c="372">We will learn about the platform differences and which platform types are most </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="451">commonly built.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="466">Next, we will delve into the three core elements of a platform: the pervasive cloud, the developer experience, and the main attributes of a platform. </st><st c="617">Overall, we will see recurring elements of cloud-native engineering. </st><st c="686">This leads us to the question of whether we really need yet another abstraction layer. </st><st c="773">We will also consider whether a platform will help us to overcome the problem of a high cognitive load caused by overengineered complex systems and development processes or just end up being yet another layer. </st><st c="983">We will reflect on some of those layers to find an answer </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1041">for ourselves.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="1055">Finally, we will go into aspects that go beyond the technology and the implementation of platforms. </st><st c="1156">It is crucial to understand the sociotechnical aspects and put the human, our actual stakeholders, at the center. </st><st c="1270">This allows us to define a better platform product and find approaches for a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1347">close collaboration.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="1367">In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1420">main topics:</st></span></p>

				<li><st c="1432">The demand for platforms as </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1461">a product</st></span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/><st c="1589">The demand for platforms as a product</st></h1>
			<p><st c="1627">In the </st><a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><st c="1635">cloud-native environment, hardly any other topic has built up such a myth in recent years as the term </st><em class="italic"><st c="1737">platform</st></em><st c="1745"> and the associated role of the platform engineer. </st><st c="1796">As with the introduction of the first usable CI/CD pipelines, this gold rush led to rapid adaptation, often without sense or reason. </st><st c="1929">Now that we have arrived in the valley of knowledge, we can deal extensively with the question: do you need a platform, and if so, how do you design and implement it to ensure that it lasts into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2124">the future?</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="2135">To answer this </st><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><st c="2151">question, we should first look at what constitutes such a platform. </st><st c="2219">A platform is the combination of different capabilities that are required to master traditional and cloud-native environments so that it supports the end user in the development, delivery, and operation of an application. </st><st c="2441">Platforms can be an enabler to turn non-cloud native infrastructures into valuable resources. </st><st c="2535">However, most computing platforms today provide some sort of API that can be used to automate the deployment and instrumentation of the available resources and build the foundation of a platform. </st><st c="2731">Platforms provide consistency across any kind of resources for the end users and grant access to its capabilities via a self-service API, templates, CLI, or other solutions. </st><st c="2905">The following example also highlights that a platform is composed of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2974">many components:</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="3133">We see usually the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><st c="3152"> topic of platform appears in the context of cloud-native, but why is that so? </st><st c="3231">Cloud-native technologies enable organizations to build and run scalable applications in public, private, and hybrid clouds. </st><st c="3356">This approach is best illustrated by functionalities such as containers, standardized service provisioning, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs. </st><st c="3512">Such functionalities realize loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. </st><st c="3613">These enable developers to make frequent changes with minimal effort. </st><st c="3683">In short, a platform is an enabler for cloud-native computing and uses its tooling to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3769">instrumentalize it</st><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/><st c="3787">.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><st c="3788">Companies and developers benefit from platforms in an equal manner</st></h2>
			<p><st c="3855">The experience </st><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><st c="3871">of a software engineer on a cloud-native platform differs from developing software natively toward a cloud provider. </st><st c="3988">Building systems focusing</st><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><st c="4013"> on one </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4021">Cloud Service Provider</st></strong><st c="4043"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="4045">CSP</st></strong><st c="4048">) will bind you to the logic of that closed ecosystem. </st><st c="4104">You will surely have a similar effect when you build on cloud-native platforms due to the fact that those are often Kubernetes-centric, utilizing the heavy unification of integrations toward the Kubernetes API. </st><st c="4315">However, the catch is that cloud-native platforms deliver the same experience without you recognizing the underlying infrastructure. </st><st c="4448">As most companies have at least two to three cloud or cloud-like service providers and already have difficulties in adapting those, a cloud-native platform is a game changer </st><em class="italic"><st c="4622">[1]</st></em><st c="4625">. Developing software on a cloud-native platform changes the mindset and architecture. </st><st c="4712">However, without adopting that mindset, the chance of failure </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4774">is high.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="4782">However, there </st><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><st c="4798">are more aspects to consider for a platform than just unified infrastructure management. </st><st c="4887">Platforms have to be made for a purpose. </st><st c="4928">The common definition of whom platforms are built for, and who the stakeholders for platform engineers are, states that those are exclusively developers. </st><st c="5082">These definitions fall short of mentioning that a whole organization, operational teams, and other specialist teams also benefit from a platform. </st><st c="5228">A platform provides software engineers with a simple access point to build, test, deploy, release, and operate their software. </st><st c="5355">It provides deep insights into the usage and allows the caretaker and administrators to maintain the infrastructure, platform, and integrations fearlessly. </st><st c="5511">To translate this into business terminology, a platform can provide a faster time to market, with more flexibility to change and adjust its components, while keeping reliability and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5693">robustness high.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="5709">What does this mean for a company now? </st><st c="5749">Due to the shortage of IT professionals on the market, the fast pace of changes in IT, and the overload of training teams for cloud technologies and providers, a platform introduces the right breakpoints for competencies. </st><st c="5971">We need these breakpoints to declutter the trend of putting multiple disciplines into a  single role such as DevOps. </st><st c="6087">Also, platform engineers utilizing DevOps methodologies are not DevOps. </st><st c="6159">We actively need to protect this role from repeating the mistakes made with the DevOps role and stay sharp in its definition. </st><st c="6285">Platform engineers integrate experts’ provided capabilities, simplify their usage of those capabilities through their platform for developers, and enable self-service for the engineers. </st><st c="6471">However, no developer will need to become an expert in multiple topics such as security, observability, infrastructure configuration and automation, and so on. </st><st c="6631">This is in contrast to a common picture of DevOps, who need to become experts with anything that is required within their silo for their application to keep them alive. </st><st c="6800">We will need DevOps in the future for the advanced handling of applications, but we must make their lives </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6906">easier, too.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6918">The platform provides an integration layer for the bottom-up capabilities that require special knowledge such as security, databases, or even the deployment of VMs or bare-metal servers, as well as top-down usage by developers and DevOps. </st><st c="7158">As visualized in the following figure, the platform engineering team is responsible for providing </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7256">this layer.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="7540">Of course, this also</st><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><st c="7561"> means that another team of experts must be trained and educated. </st><st c="7627">However, a comparably small team of platform engineers can usually build and run huge environments. </st><st c="7727">A platform ideally reduces the cognitive load for any other team within the company and lets them focus on their core value again by simplifying the machinery around the development process. </st><st c="7918">This platform helps to reduce the stress and improve transparency. </st><st c="7985">Companies from all over the world frequently share their experience with platforms and platform teams, and the typical tenor is on how they solved problems they couldn’t tackle before, or how much this has improved the quality of their products </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8230">and services.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8243">These platforms are often</st><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><st c="8269"> called </st><strong class="bold"><st c="8277">Internal Developer Platforms</st></strong><st c="8305"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="8307">IDPs</st></strong><st c="8311">) because they are usually built for an enterprise’s internal development team. </st><st c="8392">Throughout this book, we will use the terms platform, IDP, platform product, and cloud-native platform interchangeably. </st><st c="8512">However, we’ll first highlight certain aspects just a little </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8573">bit more:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8582">Platform</st></strong><st c="8591">: General term for the cross-cutting layer of technology that allows unification of services </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8685">for developers.</st></span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="8821">Platform product or platform as a product</st></strong><st c="8863">: Highlighting the dedicated team taking care of the evolution ability and long-term commitment of a platform, as well as establishing a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9001">different mindset</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="9018">Cloud-native platform</st></strong><st c="9040">: Focusing </st><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><st c="9052">on the abstraction and enablement to use standardized APIs </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9111">and integrations</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="9127">That perspective</st><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><st c="9144"> might feel fine-grained, but the term platform itself often leads to more confusion. </st><st c="9230">A cloud platform is also a platform, right? </st><st c="9274">A </st><strong class="bold"><st c="9276">Software as a Service</st></strong><st c="9297"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="9299">SaaS</st></strong><st c="9303">) could also be seen as a platform. </st><st c="9340">Referencing a</st><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><st c="9353"> cloud-native platform or IDP gives the right direction and understanding. </st><st c="9428">Depending on your organization’s maturity, it is therefore also essential to clarify these terms and establish a common understanding, language, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9577">shared knowledge.</st></span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><st c="11052">Projects versus products</st></h2>
			<p><st c="11077">Speaking </st><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><st c="11087">of organization, introducing new solutions is commonly done as a project. </st><st c="11161">So, at some point in time, someone decided to invest money in building their own platform. </st><st c="11252">This approach faces one fundamental problem: the deadline. </st><st c="11311">Projects are required to reach a target within a given time and budget frame. </st><st c="11389">If the project runs out of time or money, it focuses on the operation and maintenance of it. </st><st c="11482">These two parts of a life cycle are treated as separate things, causing a time period of rising sun and sunset. </st><st c="11594">To explain this a bit, you can see heavy investments, communications, and excitement during the implementation phase. </st><st c="11712">However, after hitting the deadline, the project turns into a dead object that requires maintenance. </st><st c="11813">DevOps didn’t change this behavior; it simply often got new names, new roles, and different processes. </st><st c="11916">However, in the end, budget, people, and attention are turned away to the next project, while just a fraction of the former budget stays. </st><st c="12054">This is frustrating for engineers who have worked hard on the implementation, and it will become frustrating for the organization over time when costs for pure maintenance keep increasing. </st><st c="12243">Still, the people who have built it might leave or join other projects. </st><st c="12315">This short-term view on implementing systems has slowly killed many good projects and team spirits. </st><st c="12415">More importantly, it shows that the business value of the solution isn’t clear. </st><st c="12495">When an implementation, such as a platform, can provide explicit value, there shouldn’t be a reason to turn away attention and cause </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12628">its sundown.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="12640">While doing </st><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><st c="12653">many implementations as projects is a valid approach, this is its death sentence with platform implementations. </st><st c="12765">Regular implementations are feature complete; they can exist after they are done. </st><st c="12847">But a platform will be always moving, always being upgraded and always be implementing new features. </st><st c="12948">When working with open-source and cloud providers, you will learn early how fast tools and software are in their own development cycle. </st><st c="13084">Features, fixes, and security patches are continuously published. </st><st c="13150">This is a significant challenge for larger organizations as they are still used to far slower release cycles. </st><st c="13260">The upside of keeping up the speed of this rapid development is that you, as an organization, can profit from new features and capabilities frequently. </st><st c="13412">It is an innovation driver and enabler, allowing you to implement systems in other ways and solve problems you might not be aware of. </st><st c="13546">Is a problem that isn’t painful for you a real problem? </st><st c="13602">Organizations tend not to consider such things as issues since they are used to only identifying painful processes </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13717">and approaches.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="13732">Let us look at an example. </st><st c="13760">In the current year (2024), the European Union released a law to improve companies’ reporting on their carbon emissions. </st><st c="13881">On a high level, this also includes IT resources. </st><st c="13931">Also, within the last few years, multiple open source foundations and projects have been started to bring transparency to the energy consumption of software. </st><st c="14089">A year ago, we would only have been able to report very rough, highly estimated numbers when it comes to energy consumption for a data center, for a server, and with some manual processing, for a piece of software. </st><st c="14304">Today, we can obtain fine-grained information for any application running on bare metal, hypervisor, or containerized within Kubernetes as tooling has evolved to provide this data. </st><st c="14485">Public CSPs provide more and more insights into their own energy consumption. </st><st c="14563">What can we expect for the coming year? </st><st c="14603">We can expect even better numbers, including the regional carbon mix of the energy and end-to-end visibility and transparency of such numbers. </st><st c="14746">With platforms and platform engineering teams, such transparency will naturally come over time. </st><st c="14842">It doesn’t require a project turning IT upside down. </st><st c="14895">Calling out the demand for it will result in platform engineering teams implementing those capabilities into the platform’s core to benefit everyone who uses that platform to build, deploy, release, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="15098">operate software.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="15115">This is called a product mindset and it feels natural for platforms to adapt to the demands of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="15211">their </st><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/><st c="15217">environment.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/><st c="15229">Platform as a product</st></h2>
			<p><st c="15251">Platforms as a product </st><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><st c="15275">are user-centric, listening to and actively researching the end user demand to keep improving their services. </st><st c="15385">A product is also aware of its value. </st><st c="15423">Similar to any app on your mobile phone, it uses its own value to refinance further development and new features. </st><st c="15537">Here, there are no deadlines and no sunsets. </st><st c="15582">The goal is just to strive to become better with every release. </st><st c="15646">What this gives to an organization is an expert team that keeps actively working on central enablement for providing your business with a platform of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="15796">value generation.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="15813">Designing and developing a platform as a product goes beyond the pure engineering aspect. </st><st c="15904">It faces organizational challenges that should be considered when you actively decide to build a platform. </st><st c="16011">In fact, you have to deliver valid numbers on your benefits and show that your platform carries its own costs. </st><st c="16122">This must be in the mindset of the product owner and platform engineers. </st><st c="16195">The idea here is not to become business people but to be able to clearly communicate the reason for existence and, more importantly, to be a product that doesn’t have </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="16362">a deadline.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="18875">Before you define a platform product for your organization, you should answer all the points on the checklist. </st><st c="18987">It makes sense to have multiple points illustrating why you need it. </st><st c="19056">For example, having a team ask for an IDP, or having someone mention that they’ve heard of it in a conference, is not a strong foundation for making such a decision. </st><st c="19222">The introduction of platforms is a journey, and from our experience, it can become the central focal point for one’s company in a relatively short amount of time. </st><st c="19385">Under such pressure, you still need to have a purpose </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="19439">and direction.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="19453">Now that we have learned how to define the purpose of our platform, we will need to discuss the question of whether we really need this additional</st><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/> <span class="No-Break"><st c="19600">abstraction layer.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/><st c="19619">Do we need yet another abstraction layer?</st></h1>
			<p><st c="19661">Let’s briefly s</st><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><st c="19677">ummarize what we have seen so far. </st><st c="19713">A platform puts a bracket around, and a layer of abstraction on top of, your existing infrastructure and environments. </st><st c="19832">The platform enhances it with further capabilities so that your development teams can utilize it in an automated, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="19946">self-serving way.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="19963">From a technical perspective, this represents the next layer of abstraction. </st><st c="20041">Therefore, it is only right to discuss this new fabric we put on top. </st><st c="20111">Going from the bottom to the top, we see the bare metal, followed by the hypervisor for virtualization; this is topped by cloud providers. </st><st c="20250">Some might include containers, Kubernetes, or serverless components – and now, we will add our platform. </st><st c="20355">These are at least four layers, each promising to make the layer underneath simpler and glued together by</st><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><st c="20460"> a hard-to-be-defined meta-level of scripts, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="20505">Infrastructure as Code</st></strong><st c="20527"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="20529">IaC</st></strong><st c="20532">), cloud libraries, and automation. </st><st c="20569">So, do we really need this yet another layer, or are we using it to keep ourselves </st><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/><st c="20652">busy </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="20657">building things?</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/><st c="20673">Declutter the abstraction layers</st></h2>
			<p><st c="20706">There is no </st><a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><st c="20719">simple answer to that question, but by looking into the purpose of each layer, you might be able to grow your own understanding </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="20847">of it.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="20853">Hypervisors were initially introduced to simplify the supply of hosts so that software could run and better utilize servers. </st><st c="20979">Today, they still serve the same purpose but could be replaced by Kubernetes and container runtimes. </st><st c="21080">A key argument against this replacement is that a virtual machine provides better isolation and higher security. </st><st c="21193">Without getting too deep into this discussion, there are options to provide very solid isolation, such as with Kata containers. </st><st c="21321">The only component that causes headaches is the container with the OS and its runtime. </st><st c="21408">Looking some years into the future, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="21444">WebAssembly</st></strong><st c="21455"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="21457">Wasm</st></strong><st c="21461">) could</st><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/><st c="21469"> be one part of the answer to that problem. </st><st c="21513">Without an operating system in the container and pure naked binary files, there are almost no gates open for attacks. </st><st c="21631">However, let’s give it some </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="21659">more time.</st></span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold"><st c="21669">Infrastructure as a Service</st></strong><st c="21697"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="21699">IaaS</st></strong><st c="21703">) providers</st><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><st c="21715"> and public cloud providers enhance this with software-defined storage and networks, reducing the complexity of building your own data center and managing all physical dependencies. </st><st c="21897">In addition, they provide further capabilities of commonly used scenarios, such as databases, load balancing, user management, message queues, or ML playgrounds and pre-trained AI models. </st><st c="22085">This is a very useful implementation, which leads to a rapid development of the industry and an extension of what is possible. </st><st c="22212">However, this also moved the whole industry in a problematic direction. </st><st c="22284">The technology is developing faster than people and organizations, in particular, are able to adapt to it. </st><st c="22391">We see that there is a shortage of professional engineers across the globe, while businesses are looking into providing more digital services every year. </st><st c="22545">Solutions and their dependencies are therefore built natively to the cloud. </st><st c="22621">The return on this effort can be significant. </st><st c="22667">You are able to manage any kind of infrastructure and services with a relatively small group of people globally. </st><st c="22780">Yet the reality also states that the average company has between two and three IaaS and public CPSs, plus (often) its own computing capacities, as well as around 10 SaaS providers, which can go up to around 50 for major enterprises </st><em class="italic"><st c="23012">[1]</st></em><st c="23015">. CSPs also have between 40 to 200 different services. </st><st c="23070">In other words, we are able to achieve a lot today, but the complexity of those environments has also </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23172">become significant.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="23191">To tame this</st><a id="_idIndexMarker027"/><st c="23204"> scale, IaC and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="23220">Cloud Development Kits</st></strong><st c="23242"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="23244">CDKs</st></strong><st c="23248">) have</st><a id="_idIndexMarker028"/><st c="23255"> become the tools of choice to manage your landing zones and software integrations. </st><st c="23339">The fun part of the story is that practices such as DevOps, which are commonly misinterpreted, have made things even worse. </st><st c="23463">These misinterpretations have now led to the sudden expectation for developers to also set up and maintain the infrastructure for their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="23599">software needs.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="23614">Last but not least, we have systems based on containers, Kubernetes, or serverless. </st><st c="23699">Dozens of options exist for each of them to provision those environments, deploy the code, and run the components. </st><st c="23814">It’s understandable that there are too many layers you have to take care of. </st><st c="23891">However, their development is reasonable, as you don’t want to do things in the old way of getting software up and running. </st><st c="24015">Pushing code to images and from there to a runtime you choose simplifies the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="24092">provisioning process.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="24113">Overall, to represent the level of complexity, we can think of a three-dimensional object such as a cube made of cubes. </st><st c="24234">The following illustration shows the different service layers, representing different maturity of abstraction and how layer after layer comes together to form an </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="24396">IT environment.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="34317">We must consider that every developer might have a different preference when designing the platform. </st><st c="34419">It starts directly with the problem of the interaction between the platform and the user. </st><st c="34509">Developers might ask various questions, such as the following. </st><st c="34572">Do we need to set up a portal? </st><st c="34603">Is pushing code on a Git service enough? </st><st c="34644">Can I interact with the platform via CLI? </st><st c="34686">It can be hard to tell, but successful platforms provide all of those interactions. </st><st c="34770">Starting with an API-centric approach will enable any other path to be taken simultaneously. </st><st c="34863">A strong API is the core of a good platform. </st><st c="34908">In reality, most platforms still provide multiple different interfaces. </st><st c="34980">The rapid development of tools to unify this will overcome such challenges and if considered to be built on greenfield, it can be then placed directly into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="35136">the core.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="35145">An example of such a core is Kratix. </st><st c="35183">The Apache 2.0-licensed open source platform describes itself as a “</st><em class="italic"><st c="35251">... platform framework for building composable IDPs</st></em><st c="35302">.” In the following figure, you can see how Kratix positions itself between all the common tools we use today and provides one </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="35429">entry point.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="37595">A platform </st><a id="_idIndexMarker049"/><st c="37607">must fulfill certain attributes and provide some core components that allow us to serve capabilities to the end user. </st><st c="37725">So far, we have learned about all the complexity to handle, the integrations to take on, and the focus and mindset on the end user to create the best possible experience and product. </st><st c="37908">All of this must be matched with a technical, processual, or methodical approach in the shape of attributes. </st><st c="38017">For the development of an idea for your platform, we can only encourage you to look into attributes and then decide on the best solution for you, rather than taking a solution and constructing its usefulness around </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="38232">your case.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="38242">Some attributes, such as reducing the cognitive load, the platform as a product, or the developer/user experience, are well covered</st><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/><st c="38374">. However, there is more to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="38402">be considered:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="38416">Flexibility, adjustability, and composability</st></strong><st c="38462">: Platforms should offer flexibility in how they are used and integrated with other systems. </st><st c="38556">By supporting modular and composable design, users can customize and extend the platform with optional features that suit their specific needs without being overwhelmed by unnecessary functionalities. </st><st c="38757">This approach allows the platform to serve a broad user base with diverse requirements while</st><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/><st c="38849"> maintaining simplicity </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="38873">and manageability.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="38891">Secure</st></strong><st c="38898">: Security is a critical attribute that must be embedded in the design and architecture of the platform. </st><strong class="bold"><st c="39004">Secure by default</st></strong><st c="39021"> means</st><a id="_idIndexMarker050"/><st c="39027"> that the platform employs the best security practices and configurations out of the box. </st><st c="39117">Users should have robust </st><a id="_idIndexMarker051"/><st c="39142">security measures in place without needing to configure them extensively. </st><st c="39216">This includes data encryption, secure access controls, and regular security</st><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/><st c="39291"> updates to protect </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="39311">against vulnerabilities.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="39335">Self-service</st></strong><st c="39348">: Enabling a self-service functionality allows users to perform tasks such as setting up environments, deploying applications, and accessing services without waiting for IT support. </st><st c="39531">This capability not only accelerates workflows but also reduces the operational burden on platform teams. </st><st c="39637">Self-service portals should be user-friendly and provide all necessary tools and permissions for</st><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/><st c="39733"> users to manage their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="39756">tasks independently.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="39776">Documentation and support</st></strong><st c="39802">: Effective documentation and onboarding are essential for empowering users and reducing the initial learning curve associated with a platform. </st><st c="39947">Comprehensive, clear, and accessible documentation ensures that users can self-serve to solve problems and understand the platform’s capabilities without external help. </st><st c="40116">Onboarding processes should guide new users through the platform’s core features and functionalities, making them feel competent and confident in using the platform from </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="40286">the start.</st></span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/><st c="41718">Understanding the socio-technical aspects</st></h1>
			<p><st c="41760">Designing a </st><a id="_idIndexMarker054"/><st c="41773">successful platform involves much more than technical prowess; it requires a deep understanding of its users’ diverse needs, fostering and motivating collaboration from an early stage, and creating an open environment that welcomes a platform-centric culture. </st><st c="42033">These sociotechnical aspects of platform engineering are crucial perspectives that emphasize not just the technical components of a platform but also the human elements—how individuals and groups interact with the system and how it influences their work and behaviors. </st><st c="42302">Understanding this often invisible part</st><a id="_idIndexMarker055"/><st c="42341"> of creating a platform is essential. </st><st c="42379">It is the glue that defines that technologically robust systems are relevant, as well as defining the deeply integrated daily workflows and behaviors of the users. </st><st c="42543">Respecting this almost meta level means enhancing productivity and driving adoption through high satisfaction. </st><st c="42654">We have to acknowledge that every technical decision has consequences, both technologically and for humans. </st><st c="42762">Therefore, it’s important to design platforms that resonate well with their users, foster a collaborative culture, drive innovation, and just make work easier on a daily basis. </st><st c="42939">By focusing on these sociotechnical aspects, platform engineers can create more adaptable, sustainable, and user-centric systems that stand the test of time in an ever-evolving </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="43116">cloud-native landscape.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="43139">However, we must be aware that we interact within a socio-technical system. </st><st c="43216">The challenge is that we have continuous friction and optimization within our work, personal, and private environments. </st><st c="43336">The work environment represents what’s happening in your professional context. </st><st c="43415">The personal environment is an “I”-centric perspective that shares the experience with anyone who is in touch with you, which can be work or private elements. </st><st c="43574">Lastly, the private environment is what others can estimate and observe, meaning what happens behind closed doors to you but can have an effect on your opinions and perspectives. </st><st c="43753">This constant moving and adjusting happens between the company or project structure, the people, the technology, and their tasks. </st><st c="43883">Within this, we have different influences and motivational drivers. </st><st c="43951">The following representation should visualize this continuous movement. </st><st c="44023">Subsystems and systems themselves have their own rules, activities, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="44091">and powers.</st></span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/><st c="44895">Understand user needs in platform design</st></h2>
			<p><st c="44936">A platform</st><a id="_idIndexMarker057"/><st c="44947"> design must inherently be flexible to accommodate a wider range of stakeholders than only developers. </st><st c="45050">We can’t say it enough, but implementing a platform is an all-hands-on-deck decision. </st><st c="45136">Software engineers, product owners, business stakeholders, and operative teams all have unique requirements and challenges they expect the platform to handle. </st><st c="45295">Developers may seek straightforward tools for deployment and testing, while end users need intuitive interfaces and seamless interaction. </st><st c="45433">Business stakeholders, meanwhile, are likely to be primarily focused on </st><strong class="bold"><st c="45505">Return on Investment</st></strong><st c="45525"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="45527">ROI</st></strong><st c="45530">), security, governance, compliance, and scalability. </st><st c="45585">As a platform engineer and architect, it is your responsibility to identify these demands and balance them throughout the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="45707">platform’s lifecycle.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="45728">So, the first step </st><a id="_idIndexMarker058"/><st c="45748">in user-oriented platform design is to accurately identify and understand the different stakeholder groups interacting with the platform. </st><st c="45886">In the early stages, you can do interviews and surveys to get a clear picture. </st><st c="45965">Consider a 360-degree view and know that it’s better to interview one person too many than to interview too few people overall. </st><st c="46093">In later stages, it’s helpful to be more data-driven and to use usage data for the different components of the platform. </st><st c="46214">Service requests and open problems and issues at the help desk will be a good indicator of the useability of the platform. </st><st c="46337">At this point, it becomes relevant to see the platform as a product and to have a product mindset, as you have to consider user feedback from the earliest stages of development and throughout the product life cycle, ensuring the platform is accessible, intuitive, and efficient. </st><st c="46616">A false sense of vanity will definitely steer your efforts in a bad direction. </st><st c="46695">It is helpful to define principles such as transparency or simplicity that will guide you through the development and decision process. </st><st c="46831">In the upcoming chapter, we will tackle this topic </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="46882">in depth.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="46891">To remain relevant and efficient, platforms must evolve. </st><st c="46949">Remember that projects die when they hit the deadline; products evolve with every release and piece of user feedback. </st><st c="47067">Establishing robust release documentation and feedback loops is critical for this iterative process of improvement. </st><st c="47183">Which channel suits your organization and users best is for you to decide, but there are many ways beyond surveys and interviews. </st><st c="47313">Examples include direct interactions via communication tools, user forums, support solutions, even internal corporate social media, or in an extreme case, embedded feedback mechanisms within the platform itself. </st><st c="47525">Regular updates and upgrades, defined by real user experiences and challenges, ensure that the platform remains aligned with user needs and industry stan</st><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/><st c="47678">dards, fostering loyalty and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="47708">sustained engagement.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/><st c="47729">Foster and enhance collaboration</st></h2>
			<p><st c="47762">The issue </st><a id="_idIndexMarker059"/><st c="47773">of transparent, open feedback loops is that they require a well-set-up collaboration. </st><st c="47859">Otherwise, it feels artificial, and in some sense like the traditional approach of requirements engineering. </st><st c="47968">As platform engineers, we have to package these classic methods into a more personal and welcoming approach. </st><st c="48077">Effective collaboration is the cornerstone of any successful platform. </st><st c="48148">By integrating the right communication tools, creating a fantastic user experience through customization, and advocating for cross-functional teamwork, platforms can become more than just technology solutions—they can become a place for collaboration between different development teams and a driver for organizations </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="48466">and innovation.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="48481">To foster </st><a id="_idIndexMarker060"/><st c="48492">collaboration, your team and the platform must be open and welcoming. </st><st c="48562">Reduce any kind of barriers to onboarding a new product team and provide them with differently presented starting points. </st><st c="48684">It must be clear how and where to reach your team for any kinds of questions. </st><st c="48762">This is important in the early days of a new end user team joining your platform. </st><st c="48844">Eliminate any kind of implicit expectation that it is clear where and how to find your team, as it usually isn’t, especially in larger organizations. </st><st c="48994">This requires that you and your team become platform advocates, alongside internal public documentation and landing pages. </st><st c="49117">You have to go out there, work with other teams together, listen to them talk about their challenges, and show them your solutions. </st><st c="49249">Where possible, you have to inform your organization about new features and use cases, and</st><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/><st c="49339"> keep showing them how simple it is to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="49378">get started.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/><st c="49390">Cultivating an open, platform-centric culture</st></h2>
			<p><st c="49436">Cultivating</st><a id="_idIndexMarker061"/><st c="49448"> an open and platform-centric culture might be the hardest part. </st><st c="49513">It requires buy-in from other budget-managing roles within your organization, in addition to your engagement. </st><st c="49623">Cultivation is based on training, motivation (which may be incentivized), and engagement with your community or user group. </st><st c="49747">All of these activities go beyond your </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="49786">budget responsibility.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="49808">Training might look like an expensive, time-consuming activity that quickly becomes outdated, but there is almost no better way to get into close and truly open contact with your end users. </st><st c="49999">Comprehensive training programs combine different approaches </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="50060">and sources:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="50072">In-person workshops that focus on different components of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="50131">your platform</st></span></li>

			</ul>
			<p><st c="50354">As you </st><a id="_idIndexMarker062"/><st c="50362">can see, you don’t have to do it all yourself. </st><st c="50409">Buy courses and training for common knowledge and provide your own to deepen this knowledge and teach your platform specifics. </st><st c="50536">Additionally, consider creating a repository and wiki of resources such as FAQs, best practice guides, troubleshooting tips, code snippets and examples, use case recommendations, and post-mortems. </st><st c="50733">This can help users feel more empowered and reduce the learning curve for new </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="50811">technology adoption.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="50831">To keep up the motivation, the training and platform usage can be combined with incentives. </st><st c="50924">There are different motivational strategies such as gamification, recognition programs, and performance-based rewards that can encourage active use of the platform. </st><st c="51089">For large organizations, we have even seen internal badge programs and </st><em class="italic"><st c="51160">cloud driver licenses</st></em><st c="51181">, which could always be combined with official certifications. </st><st c="51244">Yet at the same time, you need to be careful not to create artificially high barriers. </st><st c="51331">That would be counterproductive. </st><st c="51364">Ideally, your incentives should motivate new users and provide challenges for experts. </st><st c="51451">For example, they can be integrated with existing performance metrics to reinforce a culture that values continuous improvement and effective use of technology. </st><st c="51612">In this way, you can also influence corporate targets through defined KPIs, such as cost reduction, performance improvement, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="51737">and stability.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="51751">Finally, we have to combine all those approaches. </st><st c="51802">The best way to do this is to create a community. </st><st c="51852">We can establish such a community through user groups, regular meetups, and forums that enable users to share knowledge, solve problems collaboratively, and provide support to each other. </st><st c="52040">To nurture a community, we highly recommend that you find support from your C-level and marketing team. </st><st c="52144">It might sound easy to just bring people together, and as though all will be well once that happens. </st><st c="52245">In truth, it is a whole discipline that requires exploring strategies for engaging community members, facilitating productive discussions, and fostering a sense of belonging and ownership </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="52433">among users.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="52445">Without people and respecting their needs, your platform will either quickly be abandoned or never gain any traction in the first place. </st><st c="52583">Strategic initiatives focused on training, incentives, and a thriving community can accelerate an open, platform-centric culture. </st><st c="52713">To increase a platform’s effectiveness, you have to go beyond its pure technical deployment. </st><st c="52806">This holistic approach ensures that the platform becomes a fundamental part of the organization, driving innovation and efficiency across all levels and stakeholders, from developers and operations to business and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="53020">process owners.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="53396">You have learned about the platform fundamentals, and you recognize the comprehensive nature of platforms that combine software development, operation, and deployment into a cohesive environment. </st><st c="53593">To build on that, you saw why the platform as a product mindset is a key component. </st><st c="53677">It entails continuous development, user engagement, and responsiveness to feedback, to maintain relevance </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="53783">and value.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="53793">Then, we discussed the importance of simplifying the developer’s interactions with the platform, significantly reducing cognitive load and operational complexity. </st><st c="53957">Two short tool examples should cause your curiosity and interest in the following chapters but also show you that all those complexities and challenges </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="54109">are solvable.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="54122">In the final part, we learned about the socio-technical aspects and the obvious relevance of the human factor. </st><st c="54234">Platforms must consider both technical capabilities and human factors, ensuring that they support the workflows, collaboration, and productivity of their users. </st><st c="54395">For this, we introduced the three pillars to build on: understanding the user needs before designing a solution, fostering and enhancing collaboration, and cultivating an open, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="54572">platform-centric culture.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="54597">These lessons should motivate you to dive deeper into platform architectures and how to build them, as they enhance operational efficiency and foster innovation and agility within organizations. </st><st c="54793">By internalizing these concepts, platform engineers and architects can design solutions that are robust, user-centric, and adaptive to change, while delivering true value for </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="54968">their organizations.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="54988">Moving on from the people aspects to the architecture, we will discover how to define the principles and purpose of a platform, how to define the platform architecture, and how to m</st><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/><st c="55170">easure the platform’s success in the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="55208">upcoming chapter.</st></span></p>
