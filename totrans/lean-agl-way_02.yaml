    environments, led to the rise of “lightweight” development methodologies. These
    methods originated in the software industry, defined by software engineers dissatisfied
    with Waterfall’s rigidity. These engineers, constantly under pressure for failing
    to meet frequently shifting requirements and wrestling with unrealistic deadlines,
    envisioned an alternative approach to development that was more accommodating

    agility as a business-wide competency. This has led to discussions on whether
    the Agile Manifesto’s values sufficiently address broader organizational concerns,
    such as strategy, governance, and culture. Business agility encompasses a more
    holistic view, considering market adaptability, organizational flexibility, and
    cultural agility. While the Agile Manifesto provides a strong foundation, some
    argue it may not be comprehensive for this broader scope.

    Owner**, and incorporating input from various stakeholders, including the **Scrum
    Team** and customers. During **Product Backlog Refinement**, the Scrum Team clarifies
    the backlog items and their priorities. The Sprint begins with **Sprint Planning**,
    where the team selects the highest-priority work items from the Product Backlog,
    creating the **Sprint Backlog**. Sprints are **time-boxed** development cycles,
    which means the durations are fixed, regardless of whether the Scrum Team meets

    the transformative power of agility in addressing intricate business challenges.
    We examined the essence of organizational agility, its dynamic response to evolving
    circumstances, and its relationship with Lean practices to enhance efficiency.
    The Agile Manifesto provided foundational values shaping Agile’s trajectory, while
    the Scrum framework highlighted its strengths in iterative project management,
    emphasizing the use of small teams as problem-solving engines and the importance
    of transparency and continuous feedback.
