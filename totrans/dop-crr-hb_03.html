			<h1 id="_idParaDest-37"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Chapter 2</em>: Essential Skills for a DevOps Practitioner</h1>
			<p>The most common question heard from individuals looking to land their first DevOps role is, <em class="italic">What are the important skills?</em> The list of important skills is rather lengthy for a DevOps generalist, the type of role most common for individuals looking for their first role in DevOps. This chapter is geared toward individuals looking for their first role in DevOps. Individuals who already have careers in DevOps can skip this chapter or use it as a refresher.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scripting, coding, and programming</li>
				<li>Source code management</li>
				<li>Infrastructure management</li>
				<li>CI/CD concepts</li>
				<li>Soft skills</li>
				<li>Cloud-native frameworks</li>
				<li>Beginner DevOps certifications</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Scripting, coding, and programming</h1>
			<p>There are DevOps engineers who are highly skilled at programming. However, you don't have to be a great programmer. To be a great DevOps engineer, debugging code, automation through scripting, and working in text-only terminals are also important skills. In this section, we will cover the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Navigating the command line</li>
				<li>Scripting</li>
				<li>Modifying legacy code versus writing new code</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Navigating the command line</h2>
			<p>Command-line navigation is possibly the most essential skill for anyone looking to get a job in the field of DevOps. Command line is a generic term that applies to a text-based interface. The most <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>common command-line shell that comes with most Linux distributions is <strong class="bold">Bash</strong>. While having a basic knowledge of the usage of the <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>command line is essential to land a job as a DevOps engineer, mastery of it can help you stand apart from other applicants. There is no way to master the terminal without making it a part of your regular daily routine. There are many well-written, resourceful blogs, articles, and cheat sheets that cover the command syntax. The focus of this section will be on techniques to quickly improve your comfort level when using the command line.</p>
			<p>All navigation can be done through the command line and it is often much quicker. Even if you're not sure where you are, <strong class="bold">path with directory</strong> (<strong class="bold">pwd</strong>) has your back. <strong class="source-inline">pwd</strong> will output the <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>current path you are at in the terminal. If you would like to see what files and folders are in the current directory, use the <strong class="source-inline">ls</strong> command. To navigate to a particular folder, use the <strong class="source-inline">cd</strong> command. If you want to find a particular string of text in a text file, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">grep</strong> command. <strong class="source-inline">grep</strong> is case sensitive by default, but like most commands, there are flags that can be applied to change its behavior; for example, <strong class="source-inline">grep - i</strong> makes the search insensitive to case. If there are multiple results, you can pipe your results with <strong class="source-inline">sort</strong> to sort the results alphabetically, or even in reverse order. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 2.1</em> shows the Bash<strong class="bold"> </strong>terminal window, where some basic commands have been executed and output can be seen:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – Bash terminal with basic commands</p>
			<p>As you can <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>see in the preceding Bash terminal, there are some unique colors, the current directory is preceded by an arrow, and the branch that is checked out is shown for <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> folders. You can configure the appearance as well as setting aliases and custom functions within the <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Play Around and Have Fun</p>
			<p class="callout">Learning about the terminal should be fun, and we will expand on it in the next section. Till then, google commands, create your own, and be creative! The power of the terminal comes from its flexibility; the terminal can be customized to fit your needs and most of this customization is done through the <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file is the central area to set up aliases, functions, and customize the look and feel of your terminal. The <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file is a shell script that loads when the terminal is loaded. If you are using Bash, you will have a <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file, and a <strong class="source-inline">.zshrc</strong> file if you are using <strong class="source-inline">zsh</strong>. Within the <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file, it is possible to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Load modules:<p class="source-code">module load &lt;module&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Modify an environment variable:<p class="source-code">export PATH=$PATH:&lt;path/to/dir&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Activate a Python environment:<p class="source-code">source &lt;path/to/env&gt;/bin/activate</p></li>
				<li>Set aliases:</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Aliases are nicknames for commands, groups of commands, or scripts and can be added to the <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file. Aliases are often created to make commonly used commands shorter. It is best <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>practice to add aliases to a separate file called <strong class="source-inline">.bash_aliases</strong>, and then load <strong class="source-inline">.bash_aliases</strong> into <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then</p>
			<p class="source-code">    . ~/.bash_aliases</p>
			<p class="source-code">fi</p>
			<p>If your list of aliases is short, you can add them directly to the <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file:</p>
			<p class="source-code">alias l="ls -l"</p>
			<p class="source-code">alias la="ls -la</p>
			<p>Aliases can also be used to call functions:</p>
			<p class="source-code">alias dd=dockerdown()</p>
			<p class="source-code">dockerdown(){</p>
			<p class="source-code">  sudo docker rm -f $(sudo docker ps -a -q)</p>
			<p class="source-code">  sudo docker ps</p>
			<p class="source-code">  sudo docker rmi -f $(sudo docker images -q)</p>
			<p class="source-code">  sudo docker images</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>Another useful skill all DevOps engineers should have, and master, is the use of text editors within the terminal.</p>
			<p>Text editors are command-line tools that allow you to directly edit files from the terminal window. Common flavors are vim, emacs, and nano. Most Linux distributions have <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>vim installed by default. In the following example, we will show you how to edit your <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file. To open your file in <strong class="source-inline">vi</strong>, type <strong class="source-inline">vi &lt;/path/to/file&gt;</strong>. In the following example, the command was <strong class="source-inline">sudo vi .zshrc</strong>, which opens the .<strong class="source-inline">zshrc</strong> file in <strong class="source-inline">vim</strong> with sudo privileges:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Bash terminal with the vi editor open</p>
			<p>At this point, the file is opened in read-only mode. To enter edit mode, type <em class="italic">I</em>. To make your change, enter <em class="italic">esc</em> followed by <em class="italic">w</em> to save the file and <em class="italic">q</em> to close the editor.</p>
			<p>Text editors are powerful but require some time to be mastered. If you need information on <strong class="source-inline">vi</strong> commands, you can find great resources on various online forums. A particular favorite of mine is <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheetvi.php">https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheetvi.p<span id="_idTextAnchor067"/>hp</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Scripting</h2>
			<p>Scripts are something DevOps engineers must be capable of creating and maintaining. The secret to getting a DevOps job is being able to solve scripting problems, which means practice. There are several scripting languages currently used by DevOps engineers. No one of them is better than another; instead, each of them is best suited for distinct types of jobs.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Google Is Your Best Friend when Learning a New Language</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are struggling with something, chances are someone else has already struggled with it, solved it, and written about it. Don't work harder; instead, work smarter and more efficiently.</p>
			<h3>Python</h3>
			<p>Python is heavily used in infrastructure automation and provisioning and has become an all-purpose <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>scripting language in DevOps. It is favored by many because it is easy <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>to get started with. However, it gets exponentially more difficult as your proficiency progresses. The following is the most basic Python script (<strong class="source-inline">helloworld.py</strong>):</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – hello_world.py</p>
			<h3>Bash</h3>
			<p>Bash is the most <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>used scripting language in the Unix/Linux environment and has a strong community that <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>provides support. It is used to automate Linux servers around the world. The following is the most basic shell script (<strong class="source-inline">helloworld.sh</strong>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – hello_world.sh</p>
			<h3>JavaScript</h3>
			<p>JavaScript is used as <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>DevOps scripting to create network-centric applications. It is a lightweight DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>scripting Language. JavaScript offers numerous advantages, including less server interaction, increased interactivity, immediate feedback to visitors, and richer interfaces. The following is the most basic JavaScript script (<strong class="source-inline">helloworld.js</strong>):</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – hello_world.sh</p>
			<h3>Go</h3>
			<p>Go was introduced in 2009 and <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>has drastically changed the DevOps landscape since its inception. Built on C, Go was <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>created to be readable by humans and scalable. The following is the most basic Go script:</p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Focus on Learning One Language at a Time</p>
			<p class="callout">You set yourself up for disappointment if you try to learn multiple coding languages simultaneously. Unless circumstances require you to learn a new language, get proficiency in one language before moving on to the next.</p>
			<p>There are tons of books and online resources you can choose from when learning new languages. A great way to practice is forking a project from GitHub and making changes to it. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>some of the most useful experience you can give yourself. If you would <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>like to challenge yourself, you can try online sites designed specifically to prepare users for technical interviews, also offering a great way to upskill your coding game. Here are a couple of favorites:</p>
			<p>LeetCode: <a href="https://leetcode.com/">https://leetcode.com/</a></p>
			<p>AlgoExpert: <a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/">https://www.algoexpert.io/</a></p>
			<p>Other sites built <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>around the type of problems you may see in an interview <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>exist. Coding challenge sites can also help tremendously to increase your chances of success.</p>
			<p>Now that we have covered various scripting languages, we need to cover when to modify existing code and when to write new code.</p>
			<p>In this section, you learned <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>about navigating text-based shells such as Bash, as well as how to <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>modify existing files and create files using text editors within a shell. We also covered various scripting languages used by DevOps engineers and the best use cases for each.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will cover version control and source cod<a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>e management.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Source code management </h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Source Code Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCM</strong>) is the tool used to manage your code. Before we discuss SCM, it is crucial <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>to understand <strong class="bold">Version Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">VC</strong>), which is the process <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>used to manage your code. For this book, we will assume VC is synon<a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>ymous with <strong class="source-inline">git</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Git</h2>
			<p>An astounding 87% of developers use <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> as their version control. Git is a distributed version control <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>software initially designed by Linus Torvalds to manage the Linux kernel. The difference between <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">svn</strong> is that the complete code history is stored on each individual node when using <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> versus a single source server when using <strong class="source-inline">svn</strong>. There are several things to consider when learning <strong class="source-inline">git</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">First</strong>: Git is available on almost every operating system – macOS, Windows, and Linux all have <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> versions available.<p class="callout-heading">Getting Started with Git</p><p class="callout">Windows: <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">https://gitforwindows.org/</a></p><p class="callout">macOS: <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac">https://git-scm.com/download/mac</a></p><p class="callout">Linux: <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/linux">https://git-scm.com/download/linux</a></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Second</strong>: There are multiple branching strategies. It is recommended that you spend time learning and practice managing your own projects using various strategies. Some common strategies are defined as follows:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.07_B18117.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – Basic git workflow</p>
			<p>The basic <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> workflow has one branch, the main or <em class="italic">Master</em> branch. Developers commit directly to this <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>branch and all deployments, regardless of the environment, are made from this branch. This is a workflow that is not recommended unless you need to get set up quickly or are working on a private side project.</p>
			<p>The following diagram is a graphical representation of the <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> feature branch workflow:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Git feature branch workflow</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> feature branch workflow becomes necessary whenever there is more than one person working from the same code base. Both feature <em class="italic">A</em> and feature <em class="italic">B</em> can be created without the worry of affecting the other's ability to merge back to the <em class="italic">Master</em> branch.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.09_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Git feature branch workflow with a Develop branch&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Git feature branch workflow with a Develop branch</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> feature workflow with the <em class="italic">Develop</em> branch is one of the most popular branching strategies. The <em class="italic">Master</em> branch is always in a state that is ready to be deployed to production, and <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>developers can work on their own features without worrying about merge conflicts from other developers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Third</strong>: There are a lot of <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> commands and there is no way to memorize them all. We have included two approaches to help you feel more confident when starting out.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Add commonly used <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> commands as aliases to your <strong class="source-inline">.bash_profile</strong> file. The following is a snippet of code that can be added to your <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> file that combines three commands associated with <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> into a single <strong class="source-inline">gp</strong> alias:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.10_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – Git function example for .bashrc&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – Git function example for .bashrc</p>
			<p>The preceding <strong class="source-inline">gp</strong> alias takes two parameters: <strong class="source-inline">$1=file,</strong> or the path of files to the stage, and <strong class="source-inline">$2=commit message</strong>. The following output shows what is seen when you execute the <strong class="source-inline">gp</strong> alias. Let's break this down:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">shell_favorites</strong> is a local working directory tracked by <strong class="source-inline">git</strong>.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">git stage</strong> command moves <strong class="source-inline">README.md</strong> into the local staging area.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">git commit –m</strong> command commits the <strong class="source-inline">README.md</strong> file to the local repository with a commit <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>message, which is <strong class="source-inline">test100721</strong> in our example.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">git push</strong> command pushes the changes that are in your local repository to the remote repository that <strong class="source-inline">shell_favorites</strong> is tracked to.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the following figure, you can see the output the <strong class="source-inline">gp</strong> alias would result in:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer030" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – git push terminal output</p>
			<p>Pretty sweet, no? Adding <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> aliases won't make you a better developer but it can simplify your life.</p>
			<p>My next secret to success with <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> for beginners is having a list of commonly used <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> commands <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>close at hand at all times – a <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> cheat sheet. A favorite of mine is the one by the education group of GitHub: <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet<span id="_idTextAnchor073"/>-education.pdf</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>SCM</h2>
			<p>Popular SCM tools include <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>GitHub, GitL<a href="https://www.github.com">ab, and Bitbucket. </a></p>
			<p><a href="https://www.github.com">Gi</a>tHub: <a href="https://www.github.com">https://www.github.com</a></p>
			<p>GitLab: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">https://about.gitlab.com/</a></p>
			<p>Bitbucket: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">https://bitbucket.org/</a></p>
			<p>Each of these SCM <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>tools has unique features to help improve developers' experiences <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>and are designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. The reason these <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>solutions tend to be easy to use is the rich UI each has developed for the user. You can use any of these tools for free by signing up on their websites! Regardless of the SCM tool you choose, the version control is still <strong class="source-inline">git</strong>.</p>
			<p>In the following table, we will compare the three most popular SCM tools available as of 2021:</p>

			<p>At the end of the day, there really is no bad choice as long as you are learning.</p>
			<p>In this section, you learned about <strong class="source-inline">git</strong>, common <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> patterns, and common <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> commands. We also <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>discussed options available for source code management software.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you will learn about infrastructure tools and techniques needed to be successful as a DevOps engineer.<a id="_idTextAnchor075"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Infrastructure management</h1>
			<p>Gartner defines <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>IT infrastructure this way:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">IT infrastructure is the system of hardware, software, facilities, and service components that support the delivery of business systems and IT-enabled processes.</p>
			<p>Infrastructure management can be <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>broken down into three key stages: <em class="italic">capacity planning</em>, <em class="italic">infrastructure provisioning</em>, and <em class="italic">deployment,</em> as can be seen in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.12_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – Infrastructure management stages&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12 – Infrastructure management stages</p>
			<p>The first stage in infrastructure management is capacity planning, which will be covered next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Capacity planning </h2>
			<p>Capacity planning is the first step in <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>infrastructure management and <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>is followed by provisioning and deployment. Several tools can help with collecting the data needed to accurately plan resources as collecting accurate data is crucial to do so. Tools used during <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>capacity planning are Splunk, the <strong class="bold">ELK</strong> (<strong class="bold">Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana</strong>) Stack, and New Relic. Continuous capacity planning is required to scale up and scale down resources based on demand in production.</p>
			<p>Auto-scaling resources have two benefits, cost savings and better performance. When a resource is scaled down, it is removed from usage, which means it no longer incurs charges. When resources are scaled up, additional resources are added before performance degradation occurs.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Infrastructure provisioning </h2>
			<p>After capacity numbers are <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>successfully collected and <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>analyzed, we can move on to infrastructure provisioning. Provisioning involves the creation, allocation, and deletion of infrastructure resources based on the derived capacity numbers from capacity planning. Infrastructure resources include servers, containers, storage, networks, IPs, and load balancers that can be created and managed on cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises.</p>
			<p>A DevOps engineer needs to know how to manage infrastructure resources in the cloud and on-premises environments depending on the company's architecture. In the following examples, you will be shown boilerplate code for creating AWS EC2 instances using CloudFormation, Terraform, and Ansible.</p>
			<p>If the organization is managing resources on AWS, then AWS CloudFormation may be used to automate the creation/allocation/deletion of infrastructure resources. The following is a boiler template for CloudFormation used to provision an EC2 instance:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer033" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13 – CloudFormation example</p>
			<p>To learn <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>more about CloudFormation, visit <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html</a>. If your organization is managing resources across multiple cloud services, providers such as <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>AWS, Azure, GCP, and Terraform can be <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>used to automate the creation/allocation/deletion of infrastructure resources. The following is a Terraform file that could be used to provide an EC2 instance:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14 – Terraform example</p>
			<p>Ansible can also be used to provide resources spread across various environments both on-premises and in the cloud. The following example will create an EC2 instance with the following variables passed in: <strong class="source-inline">MY_KEY</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">EC2_TYPE</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">IMAGE</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">GROUP</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">COUNT</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">VPC_SUBNET</strong>:</p>

			<p>Now, we <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>will talk about deployment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Deployment</h2>
			<p>After infrastructure has been provisioned, proceed to the deployment stage. Deployment involves <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>installing, configuring, releasing, and <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>managing software services on the servers or containers that serve the production workload. Deployment is a process that occurs within the servers or containers that are created or allocated during the automated provisioning of infrastructure resources. A DevOps engineer can use automation tools such as Chef, Ansible, and Salt to automate the deployment of software <a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>services.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>CI/CD concepts</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Continuous Integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Continuous Delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CD</strong>) are synonymous with DevOps. This is because <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>every practice discussed <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>in <a href="B18117_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Career Paths</em> – plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, and operate – is included in the infinite CI/CD loop, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.16</em>:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16 – Infinite CI/CD loop</p>
			<p>Let's first examine CI and the related practices and tools associated with it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Continuous integration</h2>
			<p>Continuous integration is the process of merging code changes from multiple developers into a <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>single branch on a regular and frequent basis. To do this effectively, you need some form of automation that builds your code and executes a battery of tests against it. CI servers help to effectively integrate your code using CI pipelines. </p>
			<p>After a developer makes a change, code changes are committed to a source code management system by using <strong class="source-inline">git</strong>. The CI server has a built-in listener (hook) to trigger a build whenever code is committed. The pipeline creates a new build and runs a battery of tests against the build. The tests include static code analysis, dynamic code analysis, secret detection, and vulnerability scans, as well as functional and integration tests. The following figure shows how a CI server interacts with several aspects of the development life cycle:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer037" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.17_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.17 – CI pipeline&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17 – CI pipeline</p>
			<p>Continuous integration servers include Jenkins, <strong class="bold">Travis CI</strong>, <strong class="bold">CircleCI</strong>, and <strong class="bold">GitLab</strong>. </p>
			<p>Each of these offers <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>similar functionality with slight differences in the user interface and the language required to write the pipeline.</p>
			<h3>Jenkins</h3>
			<p>The first CI software we will discuss is the most widely used, Jenkins. Jenkins has a large community and <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>many features due to it being <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>open source, which is why it is also free to use. Some drawbacks to Jenkins are the overhead to maintain it as well as a complex pipeline design. Jenkins pipelines use <strong class="bold">Groovy</strong>, which is an offshoot of Java. The following is the controller-agent architecture used with Jenkins CI:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer038" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.18_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.18 – Jenkins architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.18 – Jenkins architecture</p>
			<h3>GitLab</h3>
			<p>GitLab is both an SCM and <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>CI tool. GitLab CI is new as of 2014, but its user base has grown exponentially <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>since its release. GitLab CI uses the runner concept, which means each job runs in its own container-based executor. It offers a wide range of security tools. It can be difficult to manage if you run it on-premises. You can see in the following diagram that there are many servers that <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>need to be managed and configured. However, GitLab also offers a <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) option for smaller companies looking to get started more quickly. GitLab is YML-based, making it quite easy to write and understand pipelines. The following architecture diagram is one viable option to implement GitLab within an organization:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer039" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.19_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.19 – GitLab architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.19 – GitLab architecture</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Continuous delivery</h2>
			<p>Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration. After the build stage, code changes are <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>delivered to higher environments such as stage, test, preprod, and prod. With continuous delivery, an automated release process must be in place as well. The following diagram shows the CI server stages identified as being a CI or CD task:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer040" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.20_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.20 – CI/CD pipeline&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.20 – CI/CD pipeline</p>
			<p>Continuous integration and continuous delivery are advanced skills that you will gain over time. If you are looking for entry-level DevOps engineering roles, chances are they are not going to <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>require you to have practical experience with CI/CD. However, it will be expected that you are able to discuss it and show an interest in it as it will likely be a large portion of your job. A good way to get started with CI/CD is to incorporate a pipeline into one of your code repositories. Hav<a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>e fun learning!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Cloud-native frameworks</h1>
			<p>Cloud-native is an approach to software development that leverages the capabilities of the cloud, both public <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>and private. DevOps engineers will be involved in the use of cloud-native technologies in any career they choose, making it a very important and sought-after skill.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation's (CNCF) Cloud-Native Definition:</p>
			<p class="callout">Cloud-native technologies allow everyone to use immutable technologies with modern environments. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs personify this approach and enable independent applications that are fault-tolerant and easy to manage. With automation, they enable engineers to make frequent changes with little disruption.</p>
			<p>Cloud-native has several <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>advantages, including faster development times and the ability to respond to customers more quickly.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Containers</h2>
			<p>A container is a lightweight purpose-built application that has been packaged with all the required dependencies for runtime so it can easily be run on any operating system in any environment <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>with few changes needed. Multiple containers can run on the same machine while running as segmented processes in the user space. Containers take up less space than VMs, can handle more applications, and require fewer VMs and operating systems. The following is a diagram that compares the infrastructure needed for multiple VMs versus multiple containers:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.21 – Container and VM comparison</p>
			<h3>Docker exercise</h3>
			<p>In the following <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>exercise, we will go through a basic Docker example, which can be done on your own computer.</p>
			<p>The steps are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Follow this tutorial to install Docker on your machine: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/</a>.</li>
				<li>Create a Dockerfile:<p class="source-code">touch Dockerfile</p></li>
				<li>Add content to the <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>Dockerfile using the <strong class="source-inline">vi</strong> editor:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer042" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.22_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.22 – Dockerfile&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.22 – Dockerfile</p>
			<p>After you have added the previous four lines to your file, make sure to save the file using <strong class="source-inline">:w</strong> and then exit <strong class="source-inline">vi</strong> using <strong class="source-inline">:q</strong>.</p>
			<p>The following is the Docker image:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer043" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.23_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.23 – Docker images&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.23 – Docker images</p>
			<p>If you would like to see what exactly is happening during the build, you can omit the <strong class="source-inline">–- quiet</strong> command. After the image is built and tagged, you can see that the base alpine image along with the DevOps book image is available. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Run your container <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>with the interactive terminal command:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer044" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.24_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.24 – interactive terminal command&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.24 – interactive terminal command</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">–it</strong> command runs the container with an interactive terminal, meaning a terminal session for the container will be opened, allowing you to interact with the container.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Stop and remove all containers and images from your machine:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer045" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.25_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 2.25 – Docker image removal&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p>In this chapter, you learned about containers and the role they play in DevOps. If you followed along with the exercise, you will have created a Dockerfile, created a Docker image, and run the Docker image on your computer! Hopefully, this has made you interested in continuing to learn more about Docker as the rabbit hole goes deep!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Microservice architecture</h2>
			<p>Before looking at the desired architecture, we'll cover other dated architectures.</p>
			<h3>Monolithic</h3>
			<p>We will first cover the monolithic architecture, which shares a single code base and database. Because <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>nothing is separate, everything must be released/deployed at the same time, which leads to long lead times between customer requests and them making it to production. I have worked at several companies and every one of them has had monolithic applications. There is a good chance you will run across this in your career.</p>
			<h3>Service-oriented</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Service-oriented architecture</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOA</strong>) was a step in the right direction – it broke code down by services, which <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>decreased the effort and time it took to get changes to production. Service-oriented architecture is prone to similar problems that a monolithic architecture has, such as interdependencies that require the entire application to be rebuilt even when a single service is checked in. Most of the companies I have worked with have had applications that use SOA.</p>
			<h3>Microservice</h3>
			<p>Microservice architecture has exploded in popularity due to large tech giants such as Amazon, Netflix, and Google publishing success stories about its use. The key differences <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>between SOA and microservices are the communication protocols, storage, and size. Firstly, microservices use a language-agnostic protocol to communicate with the UI, resulting in a higher number of remote calls but also much higher fault tolerance. Secondly, each microservice has its own storage/database, which means each microservice can be designed with the right-fit database for its needs versus using the same database that is used for the entire application. Lastly, the size and lack of interdependence are what really separates a microservice from an SOA. A microservice can be deployed at any time and have no effect on other components. SOA shares a database and individual services still maintain some dependencies, which does not allow for the deployment of the service individually. Most companies are striving for a microservice architecture, which is why it is a key skill to have.</p>
			<p>In the following diagram, you can see how monolithic, SOA, and microservice architecture compare:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer046" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.26 – Architecture comparison</p>
			<p>Next, we will move on <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>and discuss the importance of soft skills fo<a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>r DevOps engineers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Soft skills</h2>
			<p>Soft skills are defined as <em class="italic">personal attributes that enable someone to interact effectively and harmoniously with other people</em>. The tides are changing, and DevOps engineers can <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>no longer expect to succeed solely based on technical abilities. The following are a few of the most important soft skills for a DevOps engineer.</p>
			<h3>Empathy</h3>
			<p>With regard to DevOps, empathy is the ability to understand coworkers' and clients' points of view, or rather, the <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>ability to view a situation from someone else's shoes. Approach your colleagues with a calm demeanor. This will lead to a much more pleasant work environment where new ideas flourish. If your idea differs from your colleague's or client's, start with positive feedback about their idea and work your way on to what you disagree with. Developing <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>empathy with your coworkers ensures everyone's ideas are heard and issues that may be present can be resolved. Developing empathy with clients ensures all feedback is captured and a satisfactory end solution is reached.</p>
			<h3>Teamwork</h3>
			<p>Working in a team setting <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>allows for multiple sets of eyes to view code at the same time. Working together ensures everyone remains on the same page and that a coherent product is delivered.</p>
			<h3>Adaptability</h3>
			<p>Tech is continuously changing and, as a DevOps engineer, you must prove you are good at changing gears, whether it be learning a new language or quickly shifting priorities. During <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>an interview, you can discuss how you are learning a new programming language or how you have partnered with various departments while solutioning your last project. If you are unwilling to change, you will not succeed in DevOps.</p>
			<h3>Good communication</h3>
			<p>Good communication includes everything from in-person conversation to Slack messages. As a DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>engineer, you will likely be working with team members who are fully remote, in different time zones, and coming from different cultures. So, you must be able to communicate effectively in each of these cases. Remember, people are busy, so pick the method that is going to be most efficient and effective.</p>
			<p>Without strong soft skills, it will be difficult to land a job. DevOps is a team sport that requires you to collaborate with many different people in an environment that changes quickly. There is no room for drama or ego; everyone's opinion matters, and<a id="_idTextAnchor090"/> <a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>you need to respect that.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Beginner DevOps certifications</h1>
			<p>Like other industries, DevOps has <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>seen an increase in the number of certifications that are available to practitioners. Certificates are a great way to showcase the knowledge you have, but they do not replace experience and are not required or mandatory to get a job as a DevOps engineer. DevOps certifications can help you stand apart from other candidates during the interview <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>process. They also show your desire to continuously learn. When it comes to review time, you can use new certifications you have received since your last review as leverage for more merit. The following is a list of different certificates you can opt for:</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>AWS certifications</h2>
			<p>AWS offers a few entry-level certifications for DevOps engineers, starting with the AWS Cloud Practitioner <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>certification, which <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>requires about 6 months of hands-on experience with AWS. After you finish your AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, you can begin preparing for the AWS Associate Architect exam. The following are the certifications offered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>AWS Cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>Practitioner (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/</a>)</li>
				<li>AWS Associate <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>Architect (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/</a>)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Google Cloud certifications</h2>
			<p>For Google, there is <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>no generic beginner <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>certification, but the Associate Cloud Engineer certification is a good introduction to GCP.</p>
			<p>Associate <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>Cloud Engineer (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-engineer">https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-engineer</a>)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Azure certifications</h2>
			<p>For Azure, there <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>is a fundamentals certification that covers a <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>lot of the basics. There are several more, but we will cover more cloud certifications in the <em class="italic">Specialized competencies</em> section in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>Fundamentals (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900</a>)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Other resources</h2>
			<p>For beginner content, there are a lot of courses from Udemy, EdX, and Coursera as well, depending on the specific areas you are interested in. Certifications that cover Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes, as well as the advanced cloud specialties and professional certifications, will <a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>be covered in the following chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned the basic skills required to succeed as an entry-level DevOps engineer. The skills included navigation of a text-only terminal such as Bash, automation using various scripting languages, and understanding Git and source code management. You also learned about the basics of infrastructure management tools such as Ansible and Terraform, as well as gaining an understanding of CI and CD and pipelines. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will dive deeper into the skills required for various DevOps specialty roles.</p>
