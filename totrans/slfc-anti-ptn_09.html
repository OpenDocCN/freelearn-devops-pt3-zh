    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">
     In particular, we looked at six underlying factors that are common to many anti-patterns and are part of their root causes.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.3">
     These provide signposts that architects can use to create an awareness of what anti-patterns are likely to occur in a given architectural context and what measures may be taken to

    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">
     In order to use this knowledge in practice, we outlined two different approaches to incorporating anti-patterns into your architecture process.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">
     First, we looked at how to use it constructively for your own architectures and then how to use it diagnostically for examining

    <span class="No-Break">

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">
     Finally, we looked at where you might go from here in order to expand your knowledge further.

     We outlined three pathways you might take and gave some suggestions for books and

     Anti-patterns are one of the most interesting areas of general architecture because they tell you how things go wrong in repeatable ways.

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">
     Learning from the mistakes of others is usually a better idea than making all the mistakes yourself, and I sincerely hope that reading this book will make you much less likely to repeat these anti-patterns yourself as well as know how to spot them when others in your context are about to
