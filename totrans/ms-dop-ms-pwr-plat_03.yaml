    Power Platform services to</st> <st c="2442">their</st> **<st c="2449">citizen
    developers</st>**<st c="2467">. Citizen developers are individuals or employees
    within an organization who do not strictly hold traditional programming skills

    the importance of the ALM, which brings practices on how to govern, develop, and

    using the platform that allows multiple contributors to work on the application
    simultaneously.</st> <st c="3601">This is where a version control tool comes in.</st>
    <st c="3648">Since many tools nowadays, such as Azure DevOps and GitHub, offer
    a single platform to cover the ALM/DevOps life cycle, we can improve our speed
    of development by implementing automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
    through CI/CD pipelines.</st> <st c="3897">However, we can also improve delivery
    time by improving how we are developing our applications.</st> <st c="3993">Building
    reusable code components allows us to reuse these building blocks across projects
    and save time on the development.</st> <st c="4118">In the context of reliability,
    since we have a version control system in place, we have the possibility to do
    a rollback to the previous version, as mistakes can and will happen along the
    way.</st> <st c="4311">Having this ability increases our options to maintain system
    stability.</st> <st c="4383">The aforementioned CI/CD pipelines will help us make
    sure that applications are consistently deployed across different environments,

- en: <st c="4985">Whenever we are considering application life cycle management in
    Power Platform, we concentrate on two main concepts:</st> **<st c="5104">solutions</st>**
    <st c="5113">and</st> **<st c="5118">environments</st>**<st c="5130">. Everything
    that we develop throughout our project as part of the business solution, whether
    this would be a canvas application, flow, Dataverse table, or custom component,
    is represented as a</st> **<st c="5324">solution component</st>**<st c="5342">.
    These solution components are added into a solution, to which we apply the ALM
    process, which enables the automated approach of exporting and importing of the
    solution to different environments.</st> <st c="5539">Environments act as a container
    that isolates the content inside our tenant and allows the separation of the target
    audience.</st> <st c="5665">The concepts of both solutions and environments will
    be probably well-known to IT professionals, pro developers, and DevOps engineers.</st>
    <st c="5800">This is because a similar approach is used in traditional software
    development, where applications are packaged in a package (solutions, in the context
    of Power Platform) and deployed to various target environments, such as development,
    test, pre-production, and</st> <st c="6063">production environments.</st>

    c="6170">. ALM in Power Platform is just one part of the story.</st> <st c="6225">Many
    people think of ALM as only being the deployment process to different environments,
    but the story is bigger than that.</st> <st c="6349">We should combine it with
    DevOps and also look at implementing additional steps such as building an environment
    management strategy, automatically packaging Power Platform resources into solutions,
    securing and managing environments, and, lastly, automatically deploying to different
    environments consistently while making sure that the produced work is properly
    tested.</st> <st c="6720">DevOps on Power Platform not only focuses on app makers
    and pro-developers, but also on enabling IT administrators to build strong platform
    and IT operations (IT ops) processes, which allow us to automate platform-specific
    tasks such as environment provisioning, platform management, DLP policy management,
    auditing, and more.</st> <st c="7047">Many times, business applications extend
    outside of Power Platform, so an IT operation team also needs to take care of
    the network management, for example when configuring the integration between Power
    Platform and Azure services or other on-premises</st> <st c="7298">backend systems.</st>
