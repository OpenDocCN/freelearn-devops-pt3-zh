			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Hi John, thanks for agreeing to meet with me this afternoon to discuss your career as a DevOps leader!</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: No problem.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: To begin with, please tell us a little about yourself.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: I am John Knight, and I am an engineering manager with 16 years of experience in DevOps, 9 years of experience in the cloud, and 5 years of experience in team leadership. I have worked for and consulted with eight Fortune 500 companies and <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>hold multiple certifications in the three big public cloud providers. In my free time, I collect master's degrees.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Sounds like a successful career! Before moving on, can you touch on your statement about collecting master's degrees?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: I currently have three master's degrees and am working on a fourth. I complain that I do not have a lot of time, but I can never allow myself to not be in school; I am a knowledge nerd.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Interesting; we will come back to that, but right now, can you tell us about how you ended up getting into DevOps? </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: I was a game developer, or was trying to be. I worked on two independent MMOs before being recruited out of game development. Turns out the skills needed to deploy and patch games were also the same skills that are used to deploy and patch software. That is how I got into this field. The lead architect was too busy to do the deployments himself! 16 years later and I still thank him.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: 16 years, wow. What are some of the biggest changes in the field you have encountered and how have you ensured you stayed relevant?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: Technologies I used 10 years ago are mostly irrelevant now. You must keep up with the tech as it evolves and seek out knowledge from the experts, from the innovators, so that you exercise continuous improvement. Being a continual learner helps.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: You talked about being a collector of master's degrees, and how being a continual learner helps; I am starting to see a pattern. Can you expand on the importance of being a continual learner in the field of DevOps and how it has impacted your career?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: The technology I used 15 years ago, and some of what I used 10 years ago, is mostly obsolete. Someone coming in fresh would not have to survey the last 15 years of the field. The last 5 would be enough to be competent and even less in some areas. Being a continuous learner allows you, if nothing else, to be continuously upgrading your skills. It also allows you to be more creative in general, especially if you <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>learn about areas outside your field of interest. That is the path that leads to true leaps – when you can tie formerly unrelated areas together. It is hard now because there is so much information that you cannot know or learn everything. So, being a regular learner allows you to learn in increments and makes it much easier to do. In terms of impact, I have a broader background than other similar candidates, so that gives me a competitive advantage if nothing else. Anything you can do to differentiate yourself by gaining more knowledge, credentials, and so on helps you in the long term. Knowledge compounds.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Were there any times you encountered any setbacks or unplanned changes in your career?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: As far as setbacks or unplanned changes go, it always happens on a dynamic playing field. Once upon a time, I mostly worked in Windows systems and suddenly I moved to the Linux world. At some point, containers were introduced, as well as infrastructure as code. You must adapt or stagnate. Swim or sink.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Wow – there is a lot of valuable information packed into that statement. Next, I would like to transition to how, when, and why you decided to transition into leadership versus continuing down the individual contributor path.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: It can be hard to transition into leadership because everyone wants experience, but there must be that first opportunity where you start with no experience, and it takes faith to give you that opportunity. In my case, I wanted to try my hand for several reasons. One is that I saw it as a logical career progression, to more opportunities in my career. Second, I was inspired by good and bad managers and wanted to employ what I learned and do things differently in areas where I thought I could do better. </p>
			<p>The focus on learning, training, and improving your professional standing is also something that I encourage in all my team members, and you can see a vast improvement between the moment we started working together and a year later. </p>
			<p>There are still many areas where I need to improve, but I feel that improvement in these areas benefits me in all areas of life and business, so it is a win-win. </p>
			<p>In terms of how to make the transition, I started working in consulting in order to work with high-profile companies without needing to join their staff permanently. This gave me an outsider's perspective on their business and strengthened my people skills because they were the client and thus, I was now client-facing. </p>
			<p>After doing that for a few years, I joined a small company and managed their DevOps team and initiatives. I found that the most important skill as a consultant after technical knowledge <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>is to influence others. When you do not have authority, you must use diplomacy, charisma, and negotiation skills to get what you want. Learning this skill before you are a manager allows you to be a better leader.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Influencing others – I see that as important in my role as a more senior individual contributor as well. What other skills are transferable, and what skills are completely different?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: The ability to mentor others and make people around you better. An experienced engineer is a catalyst for junior engineers and can help them get to where they are much faster. In terms of management, being able to prioritize work and analyze competing priorities is a key strength, but virtually anyone would benefit from strength in that area. Leadership is different from management. Leadership is owning things and being accountable. Even junior associates should strive to be leaders. </p>
			<p>In management, you must negotiate a lot; you must exercise diplomacy to avoid scenarios where you win the battle but lose the war. There's a lot of managing people's expectations across multiple teams. As an individual contributor, you tend to focus on your immediate team.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: What is your advice to a junior engineer who is looking for a mentor? </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: I think we should always try to model our behavior after the positive examples we see. That way, we can improve and be influenced by those around us that have something we do not or excel in an area. Having strong relationships with senior members of the team also opens potential mentorship opportunities. </p>
			<p>You can also ask your immediate supervisor to play an active role in your career. Mentors can be found everywhere.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: A question many of us have for you revolves around the process of hiring; could you start by telling us about a few times where a candidate just did not deliver during the interview process?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: Usually, when I interview in screening, I look for experience, culture, and team fit, as well as <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>softer people skills. I want people that work well with others. I have had people focus too much on compensation, overstate their skills, or show a lack of enthusiasm. </p>
			<p>One time, I had two candidates and I sent both a curveball; a last-minute questionnaire for both to fill out. One returned it the next day, with a positive attitude. The other one was upset because this last hurdle was unexpected. The first person got the job. </p>
			<p>I have been fortunate with my hires, and I am still updating my interview process.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: John, can you give us a deeper look into other technical evaluation exercises you have used in the past? Also, which ones did you feel gave the best insight into a candidate and what are you looking for as you review the technical challenges?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: So, there are many ways to evaluate technical expertise. Usually, I focus on experience. What problems did you solve with technology you claim you know? I usually assume that what they are telling me is accurate and then just look for experience. This allows me to evaluate multiple dimensions at the same time. Sometimes, you get character insights, such as if someone is great with collaboration versus a lone wolf, and so on.</p>
			<p>Traditional metrics for technical acumen are useful but I usually leave that to other interviewers. Programming proficiency, systems experience, cloud expertise – these are all areas where it is easy to test general knowledge. I do not want to know if you can define something. You can look up every definition. I want to know what you can create by yourself, and what the limits of your knowledge and skills are. I specifically look for complements to my existing team, so having more than one skill set is always great.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Thanks John, just a few more questions. Looking back at your career, are there any specific things you wish you would have done differently or avoided?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: I moved areas based on compensation needs and not based on what I wanted to do, or whether I was particularly interested in what the company was doing. I would advise against doing this, although I understand finances have a key role in every decision. Sometimes, I wish I had been brave enough to take a lower-paying job with a company or product I was passionate about. Regardless, my choices have resulted in a good career and outcomes, so I am very fortunate. </p>
			<p>Other things I could have done differently include scanning for cultural fit more before taking the job. I have <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>worked in a few places with hostile work environments and while no question or interview is full proof, as a candidate, you should also conduct your due diligence on the company and make sure their practices align with your beliefs.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Final question, John – I have read some of your works on AI and future technologies; do you feel AI will affect the field of DevOps in the future? What should individuals do to prepare for the future of DevOps?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">John Knight</strong>: Not really AI, but <strong class="bold">AI-assisted automation</strong> and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong>. There are two intersections. <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>One involves using DevOps to deploy <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>AI or ML into production. This is known as operationalizing AI/ML or AI/MLOps.</p>
			<p>The other involves using AI agents to respond to events automatically, or ML to make predictions on things to happen or to make recommendations. This field is ripe for innovation. I would <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>think agents that automatically remediate services, such as a <strong class="bold">Site Reliability Engineer</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>) agent, should be coming soon if they do not exist already somewhere; intelligent testing automation, intelligent resource allocation, AI/ML in threat prevention, detection, remediation, and so on. </p>
			<p>To prepare, you must broaden your horizons and continuously learn. Cloud providers are great at teaching you how to use their services, but you must understand the underlying knowledge to maximize your utilization. Thankfully, we live in an age where learning resources are abundant, where we can take classes online at the best universities in the world, and where we can acquire every kind of information in the blink of an eye at the lowest possible costs. Truthfully, if you have access to the internet, there is nothing you cannot begin to learn. It is an amazing time to live in.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: It sure is, John. Thanks for taking the time to share your insights with me today and I look <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>forward to doing it again.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Interview with a senior DevOps engineer</h1>
			<p>The second individual I interviewed is <em class="italic">Veeral Patel</em>. Veeral is an individual who I had the opportunity <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>to hire into his first role as a DevOps engineer:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.2 – Veeral Patel's bio</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Good afternoon, Veeral, thanks for agreeing to sit down and discuss your journey to becoming a DevOps engineer.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: Thanks Nate, no problem!</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Before we get started, can you share some background information about yourself?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: Sure! So, I have an educational background in software engineering and data science. In the real world, I have worked in tech for the past 4 years. In terms of technical experience, I have done full stack development with React and C#, scripting with Python, and done DevOps automation work in Jenkins, GitLab, and Azure DevOps.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: When did you discover your passion for technology and what was the defining moment where you knew you wanted to write code?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: I knew I wanted to write code when I took an introduction to a computer science course in college, and it was the only class I would attend regularly, even though it was an 8 A.M. class in my first year.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Haha, so you knew it was your calling when it was worth putting effort into it; I love it! While in college, did you end up landing any internships? If so, what were they, and would you mind going into detail on what your responsibilities were and what you learned? Also, did your internship in any way influence the classes you took or subjects you studied post-internship?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: I did – I interned at <em class="italic">Medicon Health</em>! When I was there, I worked on software testing, we were doing integration testing and I used this tool called <strong class="bold">Applitools</strong>. That is when I learned how to find elements from a web browser and write scripts for clicking on elements and doing data validation. The internship did not affect the classes I <a id="_idIndexMarker516"/>took since I took the required courses that are needed to complete my degree as quickly as possible.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Do you feel your internship affected your ability to get a job out of college? Also, what was your first job post graduating college? Did you pursue a secondary degree directly after getting your undergraduate degree?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: It was easy getting a job after college. I had several offers before graduation, so I went with the company offering a higher salary. I waited a year out of college to pursue a secondary degree, which allowed my employer to pay for a small portion of it.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Sounds like a financially smart decision! What are three pieces of advice you would give to software engineering students who will be looking for a job soon?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: First, I encourage students to continue to learn modern technologies – the world of tech changes so much that you need to take time out of your workday to spend time learning. </p>
			<p>Second, if you would not pursue a job if it paid half the amount, you are not that passionate about it. It's hard to make it far in tech without passion; there is just so much competition and everyone is smart. </p>
			<p>Finally, do not be afraid to quit your job if you are not happy – there are too many opportunities out there to be stuck.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: That is solid advice that everyone would benefit from if they were to follow. I would like to switch gears and discuss how you transitioned from software engineering into cloud DevOps engineering.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: I transferred from software engineering because I liked to be able to own certain pipelines or projects or initiatives. As a software engineer, I was part of a team that maintained or created an application; it was a giant cog. In DevOps, I get to work on certain projects and own them. Also, I get to work on so much innovative technology. For example, in DevOps, I get to touch things such as AWS, Terraform, Ansible, and so on. In software engineering, I could be stuck working on Java for years.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: We should put that on a<a id="_idTextAnchor238"/> poster – <em class="italic">Get into DevOps so you are not stuck doing Java for years</em>. That sounds like the reason I got into DevOps – I wanted to work on cool technology. When you first interviewed for a DevOps role on my team, your desire to learn and soak up knowledge was the reason you beat out other candidates with similar skills; can you tell me other areas in your career where this trait has paid dividends?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: This ability and desire to learn and soak up knowledge has paid off in school as well; I have always thought formal education is very important and I think the fact that I have a few degrees can be attributed to my desire to learn. I can kind of talk about all sorts <a id="_idIndexMarker517"/>of technologies because I have spent some time at least looking into them, so interviewing is a lot easier, and I am never worried about volunteering for a task I know little about.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Veeral, will you describe the perfect member you would want to hire to join your team? What qualities should they have?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: The perfect member is a member that loves sharing ideas and does not mind taking on new challenges. I always like to hear other perspectives, and that alone can get the ideas flowing. Being technically adept is good but having a willingness to learn is just as important.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: You also have an advanced degree in data science. How does this knowledge complement your traditional DevOps skills? Do you have specific examples?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Veeral Patel</strong>: Having a degree in data science opens ideas and thoughts about what is possible with pipelines and moving data. I always think to myself about how some data or how some pipeline would be valuable in analytics or what could be done with data that currently is not readily available. When I worked in healthcare, I always thought about how much untapped data there is that is just going to the database and being displayed back to a user interface without any real analysis being done on it.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Thanks for your <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>time, Veeral – I look forward to speaking with you again. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Interview with a DevOps architect consultant</h1>
			<p>Some people have an impact on you. <em class="italic">Chris Timberlake</em> is one of those people for me. From the first time I <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>attended a meeting with him, I could tell he was going to be someone that I was going to be able to soak knowledge from. This proved true during the time our paths crossed while we worked on an implementation for GitLab together: </p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.3 – Chris Timberlake's bio</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Thanks, Chris, for agreeing to discuss your DevOps journey with me. Before we get started, can you introduce yourself and the experiences that have led you to where you are now?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: Thanks for having me, Nate! I started working with computers at a young age – before I was 10 years old. I started out working on GeoCities websites and booting tools for Yahoo Messenger, and then moved into programming video games based on the Half-Life Source Engine. These events were my introduction to programming. I have been addicted ever since. I took a short break to pursue a career in law enforcement. Then, I came back to programming and found myself through a series of events working for Red Hat on massive digital transformations. Now, I work at GitLab as a professional services architect, and I help lead digital transformations.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Wait – so you are a technologist and an officer of the law? Impressive! Do you consider yourself a DevOps engineer? Can you explain how you differentiate between a DevOps engineer and a software engineer or are they the same?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: I do consider myself a DevOps engineer, but I also consider myself a half-decent software engineer and SysAdmin. I move between the separate roles very fluently. Previously, in 2015, I would say that a DevOps engineer was just a software engineer with SysAdmins abilities. However, the DevOps field has grown substantially and evolved with the cloud market. Today, I consider a DevOps engineer its own <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>role. Today, a DevOps engineer is an engineer who handles most of the piping for automation and delivery.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Chris, you have seen many sides of engineering and DevOps. Can you explain the biggest difference between working in DevOps as a consultant versus directly for a company?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: The biggest takeaway is your role. As a consultant, you must have an entirely different mindset and you have different responsibilities. As a consultant, you are supposed to be a leader of the field, an educator, someone people look up to for answers and to get out of a hairy situation. You also have to coordinate travel, expenses, being on call, and working in different environments – sometimes without the tools necessary. As a consultant, any role you have is much more difficult. For example, as an employee, you do not have to worry so much about ensuring you are on a plane in Atlanta at 6 P.M. to meet a connection in Dallas at 10 P.M. so that you can be at a meeting in San Francisco at 8 A.M.</p>
			<p>As an employee, you have far fewer concerns. I think of being a consultant for DevOps as being two distinct roles in one. On the one hand, you are an individual contributing to DevOps engineering. On the other hand, you are a traveling leader or teacher who educates others on the topic.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Thanks, Chris. As a follow-up, question do you think a consulting role is suitable for someone looking to start their career in DevOps or is it a role for experts only?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: It is suitable for either scenario. It is less about knowledge and more about the determination and ability to remain calm under pressure. As I started my consulting career, I certainly was not an expert on all things. Even today, I am asked about things I am not an expert on. But when faced with uncertainty, I make sure I go out and find those answers for folks. I make sure I educate myself on the subject at hand while keeping a clear mind about the topics. One of the things being a consultant has taught me is that I do not understand a solution or topic unless I can reliably, accurately, and properly argue both for and against that item. Being a consultant can be a stressful job. It is certainly not for everyone. It is less about what you know and more about how you work, being able to handle the stress of the role, and even actually enjoying the role.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Thanks, Chris, I feel our readers will find this particularly useful as they navigate their DevOps career. I would like to switch gears and talk about open source. At least two of the companies you have worked for are considered pioneers in open source software – GitLab and Red Hat. Many would say they are also dominant players in the field of DevOps. Can you share your thoughts on the relationship between open source and DevOps?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: I mean, it is no secret that the future of software is open source. Historically, many of the DevOps tools and patterns came from open source projects. People would self-organize and work on a project together, then bam – you have a new product that is used by many and even corporations. Some may feel that open source is beneficial because it allows folks to be involved in software who may not otherwise be. </p>
			<p>The true power of open source is transparency, collaboration, and, most importantly, open conflict that happens. All these things are key to producing something great. Red Hat is not just a company built on open source; they bring those values into how they work and operate. They allow employees to be themselves and are transparent with those employees about things. Red Hat was able to become the biggest acquired tech company to date at 34 billion dollars. GitLab also takes these values to heart – not just with its software but in the way it works. This resulted in a massive <strong class="bold">IPO (Initial Public Offering)</strong> this year. </p>
			<p>Those same values that open source advocates and encourages drove those two companies to their <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>heights and I believe will cement DevOps as a requirement for all software and IT companies in the future. This is because DevOps also encourages and implements those same values.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: I could not agree more! Now, going on a tangent to what you said about DevOps values, what do you feel are the most in-demand and desired soft skills for DevOps professionals and those looking to break into the field?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: I think no matter the role you are in, you should aspire to be a leader. Now, that does not mean you have to be a manager or even lead anything. But having leadership-like attributes will help you in your career goals anywhere. Having effective communication skills is necessary. Clear communication that is informative and receptive cannot go overstated. Having confidence is another important attribute. </p>
			<p>Even if you must fake it till you make it. I see many amazing engineers trip themselves up with imposter syndrome. We are all here trying to build something great, we will all run into issues, and we will all fail. Lastly, I think accepting failure, being willing to risk failure, and then overcoming failure is important. Every engineer with strong soft skills has a story of when they failed hard. </p>
			<p>Me? I lost 4 million dollars in revenue in an afternoon for a company I was employed by. Being able to iterate and learn from those failures, prevent them from happening, and build something better after a failure is very important. That's because everyone in any career will fail; it is what you do after you fail that is important.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: I would be interested to hear more on the story of how you lost $4,000,000 if you can discuss that. What happened and what did you have to do to remediate the situation? Also, were there any repercussions from your employer when this happened, and what was their response?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: Unfortunately, I cannot. There are privacy concerns. What I will say is what happened; I oversaw the release of some software to a shopping cart. It caused the shopping cart to not entirely break but have a reduction in function. So, we stopped many customers from checking out, but not enough to trip automatic alerts and monitoring.</p>
			<p>As for repercussions, absolutely. I had to write a detailed document explaining how everything transpired., digging deep using the 5 Whys method. Then, I had to write a statement to the shareholders <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>of the company as to what happened and assure them it would not happen again. All I will say is that JavaScript is very cool until there is a small syntax error that causes big problems.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: I understand. I understand outside of work, your hobbies also include many software-related endeavors. Can you talk about these, and do your endeavors outside of work play into your success at work?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: Absolutely! I will not say my outside work successes have helped my career. But my failures have! I have done a significant amount of mobile, game, and desktop development, which is a fancy way of saying I have gone down the rabbit hole of finding issues with building toolchains and third-party libraries. It also means I have had experience with many technologies my normal job does not expose me to either. </p>
			<p>A good example is when Apple flipped the switch on mobile apps and blocked any apps from being able to compile code on the fly. It broke numerous MongoDB libraries: being able to navigate and resolve this issue was a terrible endeavor that I learned a lot from. I use those lessons learned in my day-to-day work.</p>
			<p>Then, there are the more fun rabbit hole projects, such as converting Quake 2 from C into C++ compilers on a weekend. This taught me the inner workings of some of the C and C++ compilers. Not all my projects involve software. I am also a huge car fanatic. Being able to diagnose and problem solve weird electrical issues with a car or engine helps me solve problems at work. These lessons are translated into software.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: I will not keep you too much longer, but I have a few more questions for you. What advice do you have to offer to individuals who want to get into the DevOps field?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: I would say that if you want to be in DevOps, you should spend a lot of time on side projects and build up a lot of knowledge. Your job will not expose you to everything you need to learn; you must be passionate about the field. Build a mobile app, make a video game, and then automate it.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Last question – technology is changing so fast. Can you paint a mental picture of what the DevOps landscape will look like 20 years from now?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chris Timberlake</strong>: In the future, I think we will see two things. First, we are going to see a consolidation of companies in DevOps as a fight for sales and market share increases. We have seen a tremendous consolidation over COVID. </p>
			<p>With that, we are also going to see a lot of new companies start, where someone has a new process or idea, and they give it a shot and build a company from it. This is similar to how GitLab and <a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>many new tech IPOs started. Both of those are near term; 5-10 years out. I could not even guess 20 years out. Everything is moving so quickly that in 20 years we could have wearable VR and Star Trek holograms. Or, those things could be like flying cars, forever just an arm's length away. </p>
			<p>No matter what, we are going to see increased transparency, collaboration, and conflict in software and DevOps. No matter what, we will be better off.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Thanks for your time, Chris, I look forward to the next time we discuss all<a id="_idTextAnchor240"/> things DevOps.</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Hi Magnus, I am excited you agreed to let me interview you about DevOps. Would you mind telling us about yourself, and your career progression in IT and DevOps?</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Magnus Hedemark</strong>: I took a very unconventional route into IT and that could be a very long story by itself. But I think throughout my journey, one thing that always served me well was to try to look ahead and see how I could be useful ahead of the known need. I like figuring out how things work, so rather than starting on the developer side, I came upon the Ops side. And I always had a knack for figuring out how to automate big, hairy, audacious things so that I could focus on smarter work. That was not common in my field in my early career, not like it is now. But there were a couple of big inflection points in the industry where the industry itself changed and my career changed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The industry started moving to Agile. I was on an Ops team at IBM where some great engineers from Brazil were huddling around their work every day, and sort of socially swarming around it in a way you do not tend to see in enterprise-driven Agile programs. This was fascinating to me and was a real reveal of what was missing in my career development.</li>
				<li>I had a CTO pull me aside and challenge me to consider a career in leadership. I was not sold on the idea, but he committed to spending time with me to understand what great looks like, and this was missing. I try to be that person now for others who I see with leadership potential. But I think when I was younger and earlier in my career, information was power, and job security meant not having successors. These days, information wants to be free, and great leaders are constantly grooming potential successors.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It turned out that I enjoyed leadership even more than engineering (though I am still constantly building things for fun). I went from just being a <em class="italic">brilliant jerk</em> who preferred to hack in isolation, to what I hope more folks would consider an empathetic and supporting leader who places a high value on collaboration. The progression was as much personal growth as professional.</p>
			<p>Today, I lead a little over 300 people with a broad-ranging product portfolio in the TechOps space.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Wow, thanks, Magnus – that was an amazing response! I guess I should not be surprised; I follow you quite closely on LinkedIn and am wondering about the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>What advice do <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>you have for young IT professionals looking to advance their career in a DevOps direction?</li>
				<li>Second, what advice do you have for more seasoned IT professionals who are considering a career in management?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Magnus Hedemark</strong>: For folks just starting, I do not think there is a boot camp that adequately prepares you. C<a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>onsistently, the absolute best people I have worked with in this field, the ones who earn well and are in demand, have a couple of defining traits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>They are very curious people, always learning new skills for personal enrichment, and then applying those skills in their work. Even in a senior leadership role, I dedicate about 10% of my annual bonus every year to leveling up my skills. That might be paying for books or coaching. This year, I am using it to underwrite some HomeLab upgrades for learning Kubernetes much more deeply. If you are just getting into DevOps, some foundational texts are more of the beginning of the journey... if you have not read these things yet, you are missing what a lot of people around you are understanding:<ul><li><strong class="bold">The Phoenix Project</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Continuous Delivery</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">The Agile Manifesto</strong> (it will take you less time to read than this answer) but even more importantly than that, the <em class="italic">12 principles</em> behind it</li></ul></li>
				<li>They are very empathetic people. I mentioned the <em class="italic">brilliant jerk</em> paradigm before and there is not much room for it now. Learning to be a good listener, to be curious instead of furious, goes a long way. Some people are gifted in this area. Others, like me, have to work harder at it. But DevOps is as much about the cultural impact as it is the cool technical skills. I think learning about the <strong class="bold">Westrum model</strong> is one of the first things I would call out to make sure you are cultivating a high-collaboration engineering culture. I also think it's important to stay aware of the cultural sensitivities of underrepresented communities in tech. <em class="italic">Guide to Allyship</em> is a good place to start. Just being aware and mindful – those strengths are introduced when we make sure to include people with different backgrounds and different ways of thinking. But as a matter of respect, too, we need to invest in understanding how to include them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For people in an individual contributor role thinking about moving into management... where do I begin? I think if you are not doing well at the curious and empathetic points I made in the previous question, I would advise that we have already got too many in this field who are missing these key traits and it may not be the right path for you. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>important to understand that going from individual contributor to manager is not a <em class="italic">promotion</em>; it is more of a lateral move to a completely different career track. For example, just to level set, where I work now, the highest-ranking individual contributor that can report to a senior manager is a senior staff software engineer. Even though there is a supervisory relationship between the two, they are at the same pay grade. When someone moves from senior staff software engineer to senior manager (a not-uncommon move), there is initially some disappointment that they are not getting paid more. Even as you move up in management, you may have highly skilled individual contributors earning more money than you. I want to tell you now and keep it filed away for when this inevitably happens – <em class="italic">get over it</em>. The jump in compensation does not tend to happen while going from individual contributor to manager (within the same organization), but when you jump from manager to director (manager of managers of individual contributors). But here is the thing – you could stay in an individual contributor role and still get that sweet pay bump by getting a promotion to principal software engineer. And your reporting relationship will change, because now, you outrank your senior manager, and you will instead be reporting directly to their director.</p>
			<p>So, it all comes back to this, I think.</p>
			<p>If you are thinking about making the move, think long and hard about what your motivations are. And think about your level of commitment to this path. Do not try to dither with <em class="italic">I'm going to still write code half the time</em>. Reality check: you are not going to write much code anymore. And if you do, you are now putting other engineers into a very uncomfortable position where they must tell the boss their code sucks. Just get over it, get over yourself, and commit to being a great leader. If you just want to be <em class="italic">an engineer with a badge</em>, this is probably not the right career move for you.</p>
			<p>For me, my motivation is to liberate latent potential (in myself, in others, in teams of people, in lines of business, their products, their customers, and the communities that they work in).</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: You have over 300 people who report under your leadership, meaning you have seen your fair share <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>of interviews, both good and bad. If you do not mind, I am sure the readers would be interested in what made the good and bad candidates stand out.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Magnus Hedemark</strong>: I think a lot of other seasoned<a id="_idTextAnchor243"/> interviewers will nod knowingly when I say that most of the time, you know in the first 5-10 minutes if that person is a slam-dunk or a hard-no. But I still like to take more time anyway, because sometimes, a <em class="italic">slam-dunk</em> can turn into a hard no when you get to know them more (but I do not think I have ever seen an interview go in the other direction). Again, I think a lot of empathy and understanding must be shown regarding there being many ways to be <em class="italic">normal</em> in this world versus just those who we identify with (affinity bias). So, the following are some of the key things I think about when I am talking to someone:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do they objectively have hard skills that will raise the bar for this team?</li>
				<li>Might they be a <em class="italic">culture add</em> to the team? (I do not interview for culture fit; that is how you get a monoculture.)</li>
				<li>I ask some questions to help a candidate expose if they are a high risk for breaking the <em class="italic">No Jerks Rule</em>, which I take very seriously as responsibility for cultivating great team <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>cultures. You can't let even one toxic person into your team, and if you find them, you cannot let them remain.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: Thanks, Magnus, for your time. I enjoyed our conversation, and I am sure the readers will as well. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter was a culmination of interviews with four DevOps professionals with varying levels of experience. We had the opportunity to speak with John Knight, who gave an insight into hiring practices, as well as what he looks for in terms of skills when hiring DevOps engineers. The DevOps leader also gave insight into how someone may transition from an individual contributor role to a manager. Lastly, John gave us his prediction for the future of DevOps.</p>
			<p>Next, we had the opportunity of speaking with senior DevOps engineer Veeral Patel, who gave insight into how he landed a job in DevOps and gave helpful tips for students looking for a job.</p>
			<p>Chris gave insight into the relationship between open source and DevOps. The major takeaway from Chris's interview is that DevOps is truly a mindset, and if you want to succeed, you cannot be afraid to fail.</p>
			<p>Finally, we had the pleasure of speaking with Magnus, a technology executive who has a storied career in DevOps and was full of insight and knowledge for individuals looking to either get into the field of DevOps or transition into leadership.</p>
