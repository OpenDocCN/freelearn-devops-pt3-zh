- en: When you get older it seems to me that most people reflect on their lives. How
    they got where they are, where they succeeded, and where they failed. I can say
    in all honesty that I've failed in my career. I know it is abnormal to start a
    book with an admission of failure, but I figure why start the book off with lies
    about succeeding beyond my wildest dreams?

- en: My aspirations align more with Jimmy Buffet than Warren Buffet. Keeping my interest
    in anything for more than a few years is a challenge and my idea of a hard day's
    work is sipping a pi√±a colada on a Hawaiian beach. Alas, I have failed in my ambitions.
    The closest to that dream I've gotten is working for a boss who always wore Hawaiian
    shirts and I don't think that counts.

- en: This whole "expertise" in automation came out of my need to do as little work
    as possible. When I was a desktop support technician, I needed ways to build a
    lot of machines in a few hours instead of manually installing Windows and applications.
    I wanted to spend my days in the office playing video games, reading books, or
    walking around and talking to people. When I was a network engineer, I wanted
    people to stop paging me when I was comfortably sleeping in the switch closets
    around campus. So I wrote tools that allowed others to switch VLAN ports or clear
    security parameters from a network port without calling me. Why manually balance
    BGP traffic every week when I could write a program that used SFLOW data to do
    it?

    tools to help make the job easier for myself, such as figuring out whether on-call
    pages were really caused by ongoing scheduled work or programs to provision all
    load balancers in a data center. Back in those days, Google had plenty of massage
    chairs and other amenities I'd rather have been taking advantage of instead of
    migrating links on a data center router while on the phone with an overworked
    hardware ops technician in Atlanta and typing into an IRC channel on why my network
    drains were still in place.

    I could make something to program facility routers or validate that Force10 routers
    were set up right. And he was such a nice person, you just couldn't say no. Or
    Kirk would come over and ask how we could automate edge router turnups because
    his team was getting overworked. Instead of making my job easier, I ended up working
    more hours to make other people's jobs easier!

- en: David (my coauthor who will introduce himself in a moment) and I come from two
    different extremes of the DevOps world. I come from a school of thought where
    almost no commercial or standard open source software is used. All DevOps tools
    are developed internally and are form-fitted to work in a specific environment.
    David comes from the school where you use as much open source software such as
    Kubernetes, GitHub, Docker, Terraform, and so on... as you can. This allows you
    to leverage a collection of available and popular tools that may not be exactly
    what you want, but come with support networks and lots of options. It is easier
    to hire engineers who already know how to work on industry-standard tools than
    those who work with custom toolsets. In this book, you will find a mix of these
    ideas and methodologies that encompass both schools of thought. It is our belief
    that a mixture of readymade and custom tools will give you the biggest bang for
    your buck.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our sincere hope is that this book will offer you not only a guide in using
    Go for your DevOps needs but also the ability to write your own tools or modify
    existing ones to leverage the power of Go to scale your operational needs at any
    company. And if nothing else, both David and I will be giving our proceeds away
    to Doctors Without Borders, so if you bought this book and nothing else comes
    of it, you will be helping a good cause.

- en: As John mentioned, we come from different origins, but find ourselves approaching
    similar problem spaces. My background is in software development and software
    engineering spanning everything from mobile application development, web development,
    and database optimization to machine learning and distributed systems. My focus
    has never really been DevOps. I'm what you might call an accidental practitioner
    of DevOps. My DevOps skills have come from the necessity to provide ever-increasing
    business value, which required me to automate all of the things that were not
    related to delivering new features and defect resolutions. My secondary motivation
    for developing DevOps skills is my desire to consistently deploy code and sleep
    through the night. There is no motivation quite like running a start-up and being
    the only person around to service a high-severity issue at 3 a.m. to encourage
    you to build resilient systems and automations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The motivations I described here should provide the basis for why I tend to
    choose solutions that are quickly applied and have considerable support in the
    open source community. If I can find an open source solution with great documentation
    that can do the vast majority of what I need pretty well, then I can glue and
    tape the rest together as needed (if you get down deep enough, at the bottom of
    nearly every solution is some dirty Bash script). For me or my teams to invest
    a great deal of time and effort into building bespoke tooling, I would need to
    have a considerable return on investment. Furthermore, when I think of bespoke
    tooling, I also consider the cost of ongoing maintenance and education of new
    team members. It's simple to point new team members to a project such as Terraform
    and ask them to learn it. There's great documentation and endless blog posts detailing
    every imaginable scenario. There's also a good chance the new team member already
    knows Terraform because they were using it at a previous job. This reasoning drives
    me to require a significant burden of proof to approve a project to build bespoke
    tooling. For these reasons, I've spent quite a bit of time using open source DevOps
    tooling, and I've made it my business to be as good at extending that tooling
    as I can be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, you will find a variety of bespoke tools for accomplishing tasks
    using only Go and the standard library. However, you will also find several examples
    of how to use existing open source tools to accomplish tasks that would otherwise
    take a vast amount of custom code to achieve. I believe our different approaches
    add to the value of the content and provide you with the tools needed for understanding
    the trade-offs involved in inventing your own solutions or extending existing
    solutions to solve common DevOps tasks.
