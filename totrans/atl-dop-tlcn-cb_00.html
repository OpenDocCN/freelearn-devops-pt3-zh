			<h1 id="_idParaDest-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>DevOps as a movement requires people in teams to examine and change three aspects where they work and interact: people, processes, and tools. Changes for people may include changes in organizational makeup or culture. Process change may include the addition of practices seen in Lean Thinking to ensure continuous delivery. Tool changes allow for quicker turnarounds <span class="No-Break">through automation.</span></p>
			<p>The tools produced by Atlassian can certainly aid our teams with improving processes and fostering automation. Key tools such as Jira and Confluence allow teams to establish standard processes that promote agility and Lean Thinking. Bitbucket Cloud, with its introduction of Bitbucket Pipelines, not only fosters version control but also allows for automation to establish continuous integration and <span class="No-Break">continuous deployment.</span></p>
			<p>But the hallmark of the Atlassian tools isn’t the tools themselves; it’s the ease to which they can connect to each other and to other tools from different manufacturers. Atlassian’s Open DevOps platform provides the ability to create easy interconnections, regardless <span class="No-Break">of vendor.</span></p>
			<p>The focus of this book is not any singular Atlassian product, such as Jira or Confluence. Rather, this book looks to highlight the ease of interconnecting Atlassian tools with other Atlassian tools or other development tools such as GitLab, GitHub, Snyk, and LaunchDarkly. The hope is that by reading this book, you can combine your Atlassian investment with your other investments to create a <span class="No-Break">robust toolchain.</span></p>
			<p>We begin with the assumption that your organization’s current state of tools includes tools from Atlassian and other vendors. Because of this, we do not advise reading this book sequentially. We feel the best use of this book is to read the chapters that apply to connecting your tools, without worrying about making an Atlassian-only stack. These incremental changes follow a Lean approach that is key to <span class="No-Break">adopting DevOps.</span></p>
			<p>We conclude the recipes in this book with an example of what an ideal DevOps toolchain looks like in <a href="B21937_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor258"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>. While the sample uses mostly Atlassian tools, it can be made with any combination <span class="No-Break">of tools.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is intended for administrators of Atlassian tools and DevOps and DevSecOps practitioners such as developers and site reliability engineers. Administrators will need to know how to create team structures such as Jira projects, Confluence spaces, and <span class="No-Break">Bitbucket workspaces.</span></p>

			<p>This book is an exploration of DevOps as a whole and where tools fit. Of particular interest are the connections that Atlassian tools can make with each other and with tools from <span class="No-Break">other manufacturers.</span></p>
			<p>We set the stage for our exploration of DevOps and toolchains by understanding the background and context of why this approach is needed. Once we have discovered the “why” of DevOps, we shift attention to Jira and the connections it can make through the Open DevOps platform. We discover how to configure Jira to connect with other tools using <span class="No-Break">this platform.</span></p>
			<p>Before any implementation begins, developers have to work with product managers, stakeholders, and perhaps even the customer to determine the need, viability, and feasibility of a new product. Jira Product Discovery aids this effort of determining which ideas should be acted on by providing a location for collecting, tracking, elaborating, and comparing different ideas for products and features. Those ideas that are ready can be linked to a Jira issue to <span class="No-Break">monitor development.</span></p>
			<p>As we start development, we need to plan our efforts and ensure our efforts are on track. We also want to ensure that the development efforts link to the overall big picture of the product and its promise of value. To that end, we will connect Jira to Confluence so that Confluence can provide the necessary <span class="No-Break">project documentation.</span></p>
