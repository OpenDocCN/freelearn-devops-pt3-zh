			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>An Introduction to DevOps and the Atlassian Ecosystem</h1>
			<p>DevOps has been a driving force for improvement in product development since its inception in 2009. As technology moved to internet-based, off-premises cloud environments, DevOps allowed people working in development and operations a way to collaborate, enabling quicker and more stable design, packaging, deployment, and maintenance of products. A key component of this is the adoption of automation that ensures these processes <span class="No-Break">run smoother.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at the DevOps movement and the role that automation plays in its success. We will then <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>look at the <strong class="bold">Open DevOps</strong> platform from <strong class="bold">Atlassian</strong> that <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>allows easy connection between Jira, other Atlassian tools such as Confluence and Bitbucket, as well as third-party tools such as LaunchDarkly, which allows you to release products through feature flags, and Snyk, which performs <span class="No-Break">security scanning.</span></p>
			<p>To start our journey into Open DevOps, we will examine the steps needed to enroll in Atlassian’s cloud environment to obtain trial versions of Jira and connections through Open DevOps. To accomplish this, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following recipes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating the Open DevOps toolchain <span class="No-Break">from scratch</span></li>
				<li>Creating a new Atlassian Cloud site with <span class="No-Break">Jira only</span></li>
				<li>Creating a <span class="No-Break">Jira project</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Connecting Confluence</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Connecting Bitbucke<a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>t</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>An introduction to DevOps</h1>
			<p>By 2009, developers <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>began to adopt Agile product development methods. They started with small deliveries in incremental cycles, gathering customer feedback and using it to inform future development cycles. They gradually created a product that their customers <span class="No-Break">would want.</span></p>
			<p>A bottleneck would soon form from delivering changes to the operations part of the organization. While rapid development of value is the priority of development teams, operations teams are charged with maintaining the stability of the environment. Anything that would diminish that stability would mean a potential loss of revenue. Typically, that meant seeing any new change as risky and allowing any changes to be released in specific maintenance windows. These windows only ended up increasing the risk of <span class="No-Break">further downtime.</span></p>
			<p>Changes would soon emerge. During the <em class="italic">O’Reilly Velocity 2009 conference</em>, John Allspaw and Paul Hammond of Flickr gave a talk titled <em class="italic">10+ Deploys a Day – Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr</em> that described the different practices that allowed them to perform multiple deployments in a single day, in contrast to many organizations that were struggling to perform a deployment in a single year. Patrick Debois, after watching the aforementioned talk and other talks on the importance of collaboration between development and operations, and being intrigued by the concept of Agile system administration following a conversation with Andrew Schafer the year before, decided to organize a conference in Ghent, Belgium, to address the topic. To emphasize this need, Debois added the common abbreviations of <em class="italic">development</em> and <em class="italic">operations</em> and combined them in the name of his conference – <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">DevOpsDays</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The momentum of the <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>first DevOpsDays conference continued to social media. Discussion continued on Twitter (now known as X), where the topic was identified through the hashtag <strong class="source-inline">#DevOps</strong>. Additional DevOpsDays conferences were organized in various cities throughout the world. The movement caught the attention of Gartner, who, in 2011, predicted that DevOps would soon be adopted by enterprises. This ensured that DevOps moved from an underground movement to a mainstream idea to implement <span class="No-Break">in business.</span></p>
			<p>Now that the idea of collaboration between development and operations has shown benefits and proven to be popular, one key question is how successful DevOps implementations are started. A key model to that approach is identified in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>The CALMS/CALMR approach</h2>
			<p>In preparation<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> for the <em class="italic">2010 DevOpsDays conference</em>, John Willis and Damon Edwards were asked the same question about the burgeoning DevOps movement – how do we implement DevOps? In other words, what were the important factors for a successful <span class="No-Break">DevOps implementation?</span></p>
			<p>They <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>came up with an acronym, <strong class="bold">CAMS</strong>, where each letter identified a key component for a successful DevOps approach. <strong class="bold">C</strong> stood for <strong class="bold">Culture</strong>, <strong class="bold">A</strong> represented <strong class="bold">Automation</strong>. <strong class="bold">M</strong> was for <strong class="bold">Measurement</strong>, and <strong class="bold">S</strong> stood <span class="No-Break">for </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Sharing</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>When writing in <em class="italic">The DevOps Handbook</em>, Jez Humble elaborated on the CAMS model. He added an <strong class="bold">L</strong>, which stood for <strong class="bold">Lean</strong>. With this addition, CAMS <span class="No-Break">became </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CALMS</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Scaled Agile Inc., when adopting <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>DevOps into the <strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>), modified the approach. Reasoning that the ideal DevOps culture was one of shared responsibility, Scaled Agile removed the S for Sharing and replaced it with an <strong class="bold">R</strong>, which stood for <strong class="bold">Recovery</strong>. CALMS became <strong class="bold">CALMR</strong> when practicing DevOps <span class="No-Break">in SAFe.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s take a look at each letter of the CALMS and CALMR approaches and see how they fit in with the adoption of Atlassian tools and the Open <span class="No-Break">DevOps platform.</span></p>
			<h3>Culture</h3>
			<p>The management <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>expert Peter Drucker is credited with saying, <em class="italic">“Culture eats strategy for breakfast,”</em> underlying the impact that culture, as a common thread, can have on uniting individuals in a group, from as small as a team, to as large as nations. So, if the correct culture can drive organizations to desired results, what is the correct culture? To find the answer, we turn to a sociologist named <span class="No-Break">Ron Westrum.</span></p>
			<p>In 1988, Ron Westrum organized a study to measure the safety of medical teams. He organized the teams into three different types <span class="No-Break">of cultures:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Pathological</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Bureaucratic</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Generative</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A pathological culture is one that’s leader-driven. Motivation mainly comes through fear and threats from the leaders to accomplish the (<span class="No-Break">leader’s) goals.</span></p>
			<p>A bureaucratic <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>culture has safety mechanisms through rules and standards, but these can then be used to protect the members of the group <span class="No-Break">from outsiders.</span></p>
			<p>A generative culture, in contrast, is focused on aligning with a common mission. Information is freely shared with whomever, whether they are a member of the group or not, irrespective of whether they can play a role in the success of <span class="No-Break">the mission.</span></p>
			<p>Westrum found in his initial study that medical teams that possessed a generative culture also possessed alignment to their mission, an awareness of things that impeded the mission, and gave empowerment to any individual to make changes to remove those impediments. This allowed organizations to easily make long-lasting improvements to the system to improve the teams <span class="No-Break">even more.</span></p>
			<p>These benefits are not limited to medical teams. In the book <em class="italic">Accelerate – Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations</em>, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim investigated recommending DevOps practices to teams to see how effective they were. They surveyed development teams and found that those teams that had a generative culture produced higher levels of performance for software delivery and experienced higher levels of <span class="No-Break">job satisfaction.</span></p>
			<p>A change in culture, while possible, is typically the last change that occurs after structural and behavioral changes. Atlassian does provide tools that assist in the change of structure and behavior to move teams to a generative culture. These tools that assist cultural change are available for free as the Team Playbook (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook">https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook</a>). However, going into detail about these tools is beyond the scope of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<h3>Automation</h3>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>people think of DevOps, the first thing that comes to mind is automation. In the talk given by Allspaw and Hammond at the O’Reilly Velocity 2009 conference, one of the key factors of success mentioned included the use of automated infrastructure and a common version control system for both development <span class="No-Break">and operations.</span></p>
			<p>These days, key automation is done by successfully linking tools together to form a toolchain. Each activity in development and operations has at least one tool associated <span class="No-Break">with it.</span></p>
			<p>A diagram <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>that shows development activity with associated Atlassian tools is shown in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer008">
					<img alt="Figure 1.1 – DevOps phases with Atlassian tools" src="image/B21937_01_01.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – DevOps phases with Atlassian tools</p>
			<p>This book will demonstrate in its chapters how to establish a toolchain with the Atlassian tools illustrated in the <span class="No-Break">preceding figure.</span></p>
			<h3>Lean</h3>
			<p>The system <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>created by automation can only work well if its demand does not exceed its capacity. To ensure this balance, we will look at applying lean thinking practices, initially developed as part of the Toyota Production System. Practices include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make all <span class="No-Break">work visible</span></li>
				<li>Limit the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Work-in-Progress</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">WIP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>Keep batch <span class="No-Break">sizes small</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Monitor queues</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will see the relationships between the size of the work (the queue length), the time it takes to <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>process the work (the cycle time), and how long until we see the results (the wait time) from queueing theory. A key formula in this is Little’s law, <span class="No-Break">expressed here:</span></p>
			<p><img alt="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" src="image/1.png" style="vertical-align:-0.012em;height:0.723em;width:3.001em"/></p>
			<p><em class="italic">L</em> signifies the queue length. The Greek letter <em class="italic">lambda</em> represents the throughput the team has in processing the work. <em class="italic">W</em> represents the wait time for <span class="No-Break">finished work.</span></p>
			<p>An additional equation called Kingman’s formula tells us that there’s a direct correlation between the cycle time, utilization, and variability of the items of work the team must complete. This formula (often called the <em class="italic">VUT equation</em>) is <span class="No-Break">shown here:</span></p>
			<p><img alt="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;E&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;w&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;≈&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;V&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;×&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;U&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;×&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;T&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" src="image/2.png" style="vertical-align:-0.170em;height:0.879em;width:7.013em"/></p>
			<p>In this equation, <em class="italic">E(W)</em> represents the wait time. It is shown as equivalent to the product of <em class="italic">variability (V)</em>, <em class="italic">utilization (U)</em>, and <em class="italic">cycle </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">time (T)</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Jira has features that allow us to display the work to do through Kanban boards, also allowing us to limit the WIP through column constraints. Wait times and cycle times can also be calculated from the <span class="No-Break">metrics collected.</span></p>
			<h3>Measurement</h3>
			<p>In judging <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>the effectiveness of our efforts to develop, release, and maintain our products, we need to ask three <span class="No-Break">key questions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are we on track to deliver <span class="No-Break">the solution?</span></li>
				<li>What is the health of all of our operating environments (test, stage, <span class="No-Break">and production)?</span></li>
				<li>Do our customers think we have developed the <span class="No-Break">right solution?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We saw when looking at <em class="italic">lean</em> practices in the previous section that we needed to pay attention to the following metrics to evaluate whether we operate in a state <span class="No-Break">of flow:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <span class="No-Break">cycle time</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">The WIP</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">The throughput</span></li>
				<li>Any impediments or blockers <span class="No-Break">to progress</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In looking <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>at the condition of the operating environments, we turn to the discipline of observability, where we collect all aspects of the environments from infrastructure to applications. The typical measurements for observability include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Logs</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Call/execution traces</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Metrics</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Measurements that can indicate whether our customers receive the proposed value from new product features can be tricky to determine. Vanity metrics may exist that occur naturally and indicate good trends, but after thorough analysis, they do not produce actionable answers. Metrics that have proven reliable in measuring customer sentiment include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">Pirate</em> metrics (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue) devised by Dave McClure, a look at ideal customer behavior toward a product or feature, with measurements of <span class="No-Break">that behavior</span></li>
				<li>Google HEART Metrics, used by Google UI/UX to gauge user preferences in terms of Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and <span class="No-Break">Task Success</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fit for Purpose</strong> (<strong class="bold">F4P</strong>) devised <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>by David J. Anderson and Alexei Zheglov, which measures whether a customer’s needs are met, as outlined in the book <em class="italic">Fit for Purpose – How Modern Businesses Find, Satisfy, and </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Keep Customers</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Atlassian applications can collect the needed metrics or easily integrate with dedicated metric collection tools. Jira is a proven platform to collect the metrics needed for lean. Out-of-the-box reports, as well as the easy application of third-party marketplace apps, allow us to collect and analyze required metrics. Open DevOps allows easy integration with observability tools such as those offered by Datadog and <span class="No-Break">New Relic.</span></p>
			<h3>Sharing</h3>
			<p>Once we have <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>collected the measurements, we need a way of easily displaying the information to all who need it to foster a <span class="No-Break">generative culture.</span></p>
			<p>The Atlassian tools described in this book provide a good basis to foster information sharing and transparency. Jira can produce charts and reports that can be shared on a dashboard. Other displays related to application health can be collected and displayed <span class="No-Break">using Compass.</span></p>
			<h3>Recovery</h3>
			<p>In any DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>implementation, we want to devote time and attention to planning contingency steps to take if a release causes an outage in the production environment. DevOps changes the operating model where both development and operations, either acting together or with specialized site reliability engineers, must collaborate to answer the <span class="No-Break">following questions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>How do we reduce the risk when <span class="No-Break">we release?</span></li>
				<li>What mitigation steps should be designed to limit the outage time, should <span class="No-Break">it occur?</span></li>
				<li>If an outage happens, what procedures should <span class="No-Break">we follow?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Atlassian tools may form the answer to these problems. Feature flag tools such as those provided by LaunchDarkly, easily integrate with Jira through Open DevOps. Compass provides <em class="italic">early warning</em> capabilities if an outage appears imminent. Opsgenie allows development and operations to collaborate in an outage to bring about a <span class="No-Break">swift resolution.</span></p>
			<p>We have seen the key pillars of a DevOps approach and how the Atlassian tools help foster them. In the next section, let’s examine the possible technologies that impact DevOps implementation and where Atlassian tools <span class="No-Break">can help.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Technology considerations for DevOps</h2>
			<p>The adoption of <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>the DevOps approach was encouraged by <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>emerging technologies that made it easier and faster to deploy, release, and maintain products. The changes in technology include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) pipelines</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Infrastructure-as-Code</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">IaC</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Cloud environments</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Containers/Kubernetes</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s take a closer look at <span class="No-Break">these factors.</span></p>
			<h3>CI/CD pipelines</h3>
			<p>At the time <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>of Allspaw and Hammond’s talk at the O’Reilly Velocity 2009 conference, CI tools were often used to <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>make a <em class="italic">daily</em> build or a build of software that gathered the commits of that day. After creating the build, the CI tools would run automated tests, and report the success or failure of <span class="No-Break">that operation.</span></p>
			<p>Allspaw and Hammond took their CI tool further. If a build passed all its tests, the CI tool would allow you to move the build artifacts to either a test or staging environment for further testing, or to the production environment to prepare for release <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">go-live</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The extension of CI came to be known as CD. Automating deployment by using a CI/CD tool allows for consistent deployments because steps aren’t forgotten or skipped. Testing of deployment further ensures proper function and that the behavior seen is the <span class="No-Break">desired behavior.</span></p>
			<p>As tooling moved from just automated building to incorporating all steps of CI and CD from a single trigger, version control tools began to offer their own pipeline capabilities, controlled by a text file <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>in the <strong class="bold">YAML</strong> (<strong class="bold">YAML Ain’t Markup Language</strong>) format. This facilitated a mini-movement called GitOps where build, testing, integration, packaging, and deployment all started from a single Git commit as <span class="No-Break">a trigger.</span></p>
			<h3>IaC</h3>
			<p>As CI expanded<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> to include CD, deployment into <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>environments was about to be made easier. New tools such as Ansible, Chef, Terraform, and Puppet allowed for the definition of an ideal infrastructure as specified by <span class="No-Break">text files.</span></p>
			<p>By running the infrastructure tools with the text files as input, there would be a consistent way of creating environments, whether they were used for testing, staging, or production. This consistency helped in keeping environments similar, ensuring the same testing results no matter which environment was used and preventing configuration drift, where problems were seen when environments <span class="No-Break">weren’t similar.</span></p>
			<h3>Cloud environments</h3>
			<p>While CI/CD pipelines <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>and IaC tools could be applied to many physical platforms, from cyber-physical systems that became known as <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>the <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) to physical servers, DevOps success has become associated most closely with the rise of <span class="No-Break">cloud environments.</span></p>
			<p>Cloud environments are created with virtual machines available from a vendor and are accessible through the Internet. Creation and disposal of the virtual machines can happen within minutes, allowing for dynamic and flexible setups that could be provisioned <span class="No-Break">on demand.</span></p>
			<h3>Containers and Kubernetes</h3>
			<p>The popularity of cloud environments and IaC has encouraged further thought as to how to package a software application and propagate that to multiple test, staging, and <span class="No-Break">production environments.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Containers</strong> have<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> a long history as an approach <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>to isolate processes and their resources, first in Unix and then in Linux. In 2013, Docker was the first company to introduce not only its standard of containers but also a way of managing them. The standard provided by Docker is the most prevalent one used today in describing, creating, and <span class="No-Break">managing containers.</span></p>
			<p>What is a container? If <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>we start with the application we create and how its resources are allocated on a physical computer server, we can see that its code, libraries, and data occupy some of the server’s memory, as illustrated in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer011">
					<img alt="Figure 1.2 – A packaged application in a physical server" src="image/B21937_01_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – A packaged application in a physical server</p>
			<p>Virtual machines<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> allow a physical server to host multiple <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>instances of <strong class="bold">Virtual Machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>). Each VM can have its own individual set of operating systems, applications, and accompanying libraries. The VMs are managed by a hypervisor, which is an application process run on the physical server. This arrangement is shown <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer012">
					<img alt="Figure 1.3 – VM and application packaging in a physical server" src="image/B21937_01_3.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – VM and application packaging in a physical server</p>
			<p>Docker or other<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> container management<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> systems allow for more efficient resource management. The container requires only resources for the application and any dependent third-party libraries. Any OS-level resources that are required are managed through a managing application. In Docker’s case, the managing software is Docker Engine. This arrangement is outlined <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer013">
					<img alt="Figure 1.4 – Container and server packaging" src="image/B21937_01_4.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – Container and server packaging</p>
			<p>Note that the <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>server that hosts Docker Engine and its <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>containers can be a physical server or a VM. This allows for portability, where the only artifact that can move from environment to environment is the definition of the container, known as the <span class="No-Break">container image.</span></p>
			<p>With the portability of containers, developers can create their application and deploy it into an artifact that can be version-controlled and easily transferred to testing or production. The application under development can be compartmentalized as <span class="No-Break">a service.</span></p>
			<p>Kubernetes <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>emerged from Google in 2015 as a <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>way of creating and managing clusters composed of containers. The clusters allowed for the dynamic creation of Pods from containers to make flexible and resilient services <span class="No-Break">or microservices.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have seen the underlying tenets of DevOps and the main facets of technology that drive its acceptance and popularity, it’s time to examine how the tools from Atlassian can form a<a id="_idTextAnchor025"/> toolchain for a <span class="No-Break">DevOps approach.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Creating an Open DevOps toolchain from scratch</h1>

			<p>By following the preceding steps, you should have a Jira project ready to connect to the necessary tools by means of the Issues or work artifacts, stored <span class="No-Break">in Jira.</span></p>
			<p>The following recipes allow you to make connections when the Open DevOps platform wasn’t selected to create the Atlassian Cloud site, or when the Jira product and projects were <span class="No-Break">already created.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Connecting Confluence</h1>
			<p>Confluence is <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>Atlassian’s second-oldest tool. Previously, it has complemented Jira as the repository of documentation artifacts for development activities recorded <span class="No-Break">in Jira.</span></p>
			<p>Confluence <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>works by <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>organizing individual pages into <strong class="bold">spaces</strong>. Spaces can be set up for any number of purposes, such as a knowledge base or <span class="No-Break">product documentation.</span></p>
			<p>The first step will be to add Confluence to the Atlassian Cloud site. Once added, a new space can be created for the new <span class="No-Break">Jira project.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Getting ready</h2>
			<p>Different administrators set up different things for Confluence. Let’s take a brief look at the various levels of administration for <span class="No-Break">Atlassian Cloud.</span></p>
			<p>Organization <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>administrators are responsible for the overall organization and the Atlassian Cloud sites contained within. They set up users to access specific Atlassian products and add products to Atlassian <span class="No-Break">Cloud sites.</span></p>
			<p>Confluence administrators are responsible for creating the spaces on an instance of Confluence and managing the permissions of users for those spaces, based <span class="No-Break">on roles.</span></p>
			<p>We will identify what level of administration is needed for each part of <span class="No-Break">this recipe.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>How to do it...</h2>
			<p>We will approach this recipe in two parts – the first part is where we add Confluence to the Atlassian Cloud site that also has Jira. The second part of this recipe is creating a Confluence space and connecting it to a <span class="No-Break">Jira project.</span></p>
			<h3>Adding Confluence to the Atlassian Cloud site</h3>
			<p>Let’s look at <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>adding Confluence to the same <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>Atlassian Cloud site where we added Jira only in the <em class="italic">Creating a new Atlassian Cloud site with Jira </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">only</em></span><span class="No-Break"> recipe:</span></p>

			<p>On the <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>Bitbucket side, a member of the Administrators group must create the repository or repo.
