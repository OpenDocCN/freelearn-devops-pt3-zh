     DevOps, which combines “development” and “operations,” is a set of practices that brings together software development and IT operations teams to enable faster, more reliable software delivery.

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">
     Modern DevOps practices heavily emphasize automated testing and deployment pipelines, which act as safeguards against the risks of “big-bang” deployments (releasing many changes at once).
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">
     When developers make changes to the code, these changes automatically trigger a series of tests—unit tests check individual components, integration tests verify different parts work together, and system tests ensure the entire application functions correctly.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.3">
     This automation, known as continuous integration, helps teams catch and fix problems early, before they can affect the entire system.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.4">
     Continuous delivery then takes these verified changes and automatically prepares them for release, ensuring every change
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">

      is deployment-ready.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">
     The implementation of CI/CD frameworks transforms the traditional approach of infrequent, large releases into a stream of smaller, more manageable updates.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">
     Instead of saving up dozens of changes for a major release (which can be risky, like trying to change multiple parts of an engine at once), teams can deploy individual updates as soon as they’re ready and verified.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">
     This incremental approach makes it easier to identify and fix problems—if something goes wrong, teams can quickly pinpoint which specific change caused the issue and either fix it or roll back that single change, rather than having to undo multiple updates at once.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.4">
     The result is more stable software systems, as teams can monitor each small change’s impact and address any issues before they become
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">

   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">
     Because the number of failure modes on a large deployment is so large, that means that testing becomes an enormous task, and often, you can test for weeks and still not be sure whether you have really tested all the important cases.

      Design your package structure with your architecture in mind.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.2">
      For instance, in a typical architecture that’s split by service lines, you could place common functionality in a “Common” package that all other packages depend on and then have separate packages for each service line containing relevant components.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.3">
      You might also have higher-level packages cutting across service lines for things such as common integrations and you could have separate packages split out for cross-cutting functionality, although that can be a bit tricky to manage.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.4">
      The point is that you should ensure that you manage dependencies cleanly and don’t have potentially
