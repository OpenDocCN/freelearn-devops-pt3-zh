<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">It’s important to remember that, although ITIL is indeed a release management methodology, it has more in common with the system development life cycle than the software development life cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">It is for this reason that ITIL appears first on our list. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">Now, let’s turn our attention to the waterfall release management model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.4">The waterfall model is the original release management standard for organizing projects that focus on building information systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.5">The waterfall model came into existence during the pivotal years when engineers were transitioning from programming computers with switchboards and cables to using logical sequences of holes that were etched out of punch cards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.6">This marked the first time in history that programs could be authored and managed independently of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">physical machines.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">As you can infer, this model bears resemblance to the big bang theory of the creation of the universe. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.2">The result of a condensed mixture of time, resources, and energy leads to the establishment of a finished product, in the blink of an eye, and seemingly out of nothing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.3">The following diagram is a detailed description of the big bang release </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">management model:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">The majority of the techniques used for agile development divide the work into a number of smaller increments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.2">These increments require less time and effort for upfront planning and design compared to other release management models, such as the waterfall model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.3">These iterations, known as sprints, are brief periods of activity and normally last between one and four weeks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.4">Each iteration requires the participation of a cross-functional team that works on all activities, including planning, analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.5">At the conclusion of the iteration, stakeholders see a demonstration </span><a id="_idIndexMarker176"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">of a product that is already functional. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.2">This reduces risk overall and makes it easier for the product to quickly adjust to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">new circumstances.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">The goal is to have a release that is available (with a low number of bugs) at the conclusion of each iteration, even though each iteration might not yield sufficient features to warrant a market release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">When products are developed incrementally, there is more flexibility for them to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">fail often and early</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1"> throughout each iteration phase as opposed to failing catastrophically close to the product’s final delivery date. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">There may be a requirement for multiple revisions before a product or new features can be released. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.3">The most important indicator of progress is the presence of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">working software.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">Rapid product development and reduced risk are the two major benefits of adopting the agile methodology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.2">As a result, the risks associated with creating a product that doesn’t fulfill consumer requirements can be mitigated by releasing the product to the market in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">smaller increments.</span></span></p>
