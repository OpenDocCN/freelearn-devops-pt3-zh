- en: The idea behind Kubernetes is to make engineers’ lives easier, right? Although
    true, there are pros and cons to every technology and platform. At the end of
    the day, Kubernetes does make handling containerization more efficient, but that
    doesn’t mean that it’s easy. Many organizations and engineers put in a lot of
    effort to truly get Kubernetes running the way it should run.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of this book, and the overall 50 concepts, is to help mitigate some
    of these headaches. Although one book cannot mitigate every single issue that
    can occur, or make every single component work the way that it’s supposed to,
    the overall goal is to help you use Kubernetes in an easier fashion in production,
    with 50 key pieces ranging from cloud to on-prem to monitoring and security, and
    everything in between. The world is currently full of content and ways to teach
    you Kubernetes. This book is to help you make it to the next level.

- en: Throughout this book, you’ll see everything from creating environments to deploying
    a service mesh and Kubernetes resources. I won’t lie – a lot of the topics in
    this book are literally books in themselves. Because of that, the explanations
    and overall pieces had to be trimmed down a bit. Because of that, you may not
    have all of the answers in this book, but it’ll give you an extremely good place
    to start your Kubernetes production journey.

- en: With the 50 concepts in mind, you should be able to take what you learn here
    and ultimately expand on it in your production environment. Take what you learn,
    apply it, and ultimately, know which direction to go in to learn more about the
    concepts.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for the engineer that wants to use Kubernetes in production. Perhaps
    you’ve just learned the basics and beginner-level information about Kubernetes,
    and you’re now ready to make it to the next level. Maybe you’re getting ready
    to implement Kubernetes in production or test out containerized workloads for
    your environment. In either case, you can use this book as a source to showcase
    what you should be thinking about in production.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about this book as almost a “guide.” There’s theory, hands-on sections,
    and actual code that works from start to finish to create and deploy Kubernetes
    resources. As mentioned in the preface, this book can’t cover every single topic
    in depth, as many of the topics are books within themselves, but you can use it
    as a “guide” to deploy to production.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B19116_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Kubernetes in Today’s World*,
    goes over, from a theoretical perspective, how you should think about Kubernetes
    in the current ecosystem – things such as why it’s important, what the whole idea
    of “cloud native” means, and what containerization as a whole is doing for engineers.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B19116_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038), *Getting the Ball Rolling
    with Kubernetes and the Top Three Cloud Platforms*, hits the ground running with
    cluster deployments. You’ll learn how to deploy Kubernetes clusters in Azure,
    AWS, and GCP. You’ll see from a UI/GUI perspective how to deploy the clusters
    with code. This chapter uses Terraform for **Infrastructure as Code** (**IaC**),
    as that’s currently the most popular method in production.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B19116_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060), *Running Kubernetes with Other
    Cloud Pals*, teaches you how to deploy the top three most popular managed Kubernetes
    services. However, that doesn’t mean those are the only methods. In this chapter,
    you’ll see a few more popular options that are used in production but are mostly
    used for testing production workloads, as they’re a bit cheaper from a cost perspective.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In today’s cloud-centric world, a lot of technical marketing and content that
    you see on social media doesn’t talk about on-prem. The reality is that on-prem,
    especially on-prem Kubernetes clusters, are still very much a thing. In [*Chapter
    4*](B19116_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078), *The On-Prem Kubernetes Reality Check*,
    you’ll learn about how to think about on-prem from a theoretical perspective and
    a bit hands-on.

- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B19116_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108), *Deploying Kubernetes Apps
    Like a True Cloud Native*, starts your journey into deploying applications to
    the cloud. In the first few chapters, you learned about cluster management, which
    is drastically important but only one half of the puzzle. The second piece of
    the puzzle is actual Kubernetes resource deployment.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starting off where you left off in the previous chapter, [*Chapter 6*](B19116_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138),
    *Kubernetes Deployment – Same Game, Next Level*, takes Kubernetes resource deployments
    to the next level. You’ll be introduced to concepts such as CI/CD, GitOps, and
    service mesh deployments. This is considered the “advanced” piece of Kubernetes
    resource deployments, which you’ll see a lot of in production.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Up until this point in the book, you’ve learned how to deploy and manage clusters
    and applications. Once clusters and apps are deployed, you then need to confirm
    that they’re running as expected. That’s where observability and monitoring come
    into play, which we will look at in [*Chapter 7*](B19116_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor161),
    *Kubernetes Monitoring* *and Observability*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To wrap up any Kubernetes production deployment, you need to think about one
    major element before any resource reaches production – security. Security is the
    make or break between a successful environment and a long weekend of putting out
    fires. In [*Chapter 8*](B19116_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181), *Security Reality Check*,
    you’ll learn the major components to secure a Kubernetes environment and a few
    key tools and platforms that you can use to make it happen.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a healthy combination of theory and hands-on. The reason for this
    is that theory is great, but if you don’t know how to implement it, it’s not going
    to be much use to you in production. To follow along with this book, you should
    have access to the major clouds, a few VMs, and perhaps a few dollars to spend
    on the environments.
