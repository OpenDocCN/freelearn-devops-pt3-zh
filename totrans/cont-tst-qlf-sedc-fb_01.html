			<h3><st c="5080">The evolution of testing, quality, security and feedback toward continuous strategies</st></h3>
			<p><st c="5166">The evolution</st><a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><st c="5180"> of software development, delivery, and operations toward continuous development, delivery, and operation methodologies such as Agile, DevOps, DevSecOps, and SRE was driven by several key factors and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5380">industry trends:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5396">An increasing demand for speed and agility</st></strong><st c="5439">: As markets and technology rapidly evolved, businesses faced growing pressure to deliver products and services faster. </st><st c="5560">This need for speed led to the adoption of Agile methodologies, which focus on iterative development, flexibility, and fast delivery </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5693">of software.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5705">A shift from a project to a product mindset</st></strong><st c="5749">: Traditional software development was often project-based, with a clear start and end. </st><st c="5838">However, the industry shifted toward a product mindset, where software is continuously developed, improved, and maintained. </st><st c="5962">This ongoing nature of software products necessitated methodologies such as Agile </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6044">and DevOps.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="6055">The complexity of modern software systems</st></strong><st c="6097">: The increasing complexity of software systems, with distributed architectures such as microservices, demanded more collaborative and integrated approaches. </st><st c="6256">DevOps emerged as a response, emphasizing collaboration between </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6320">development</st></strong><st c="6331"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="6333">Dev</st></strong><st c="6336">), </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6340">quality</st></strong><st c="6347"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="6349">QA</st></strong><st c="6351">), </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6355">security</st></strong><st c="6363"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="6365">Sec</st></strong><st c="6368">), and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6376">operations</st></strong><st c="6386"> (</st><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><st c="6388">Ops</st></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="6391">) teams.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="6400">Need for faster release cycles</st></strong><st c="6431">: With growing competition and technological advancements, the ability to release updates and features quickly became a competitive advantage. </st><st c="6575">This led </st><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><st c="6584">to the adoption of </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6603">Continuous Integration</st></strong><st c="6625">/</st><strong class="bold"><st c="6627">Continuous Delivery</st></strong><st c="6646"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="6648">CI/CD</st></strong><st c="6653">) practices within </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6673">DevOps frameworks.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="6691">The rise of cloud computing and automation</st></strong><st c="6734">: The advent of cloud computing and the increasing availability of automation tools allowed for more efficient and scalable software development, delivery, and operations processes. </st><st c="6917">These technologies are fundamental to DevOps, DevSecOps, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6978">SRE practices.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="6992">Growing importance of security</st></strong><st c="7023">: With the rise in cyber threats and security breaches, integrating security into the software development life cycle became crucial. </st><st c="7158">DevSecOps evolved from DevOps by incorporating Sec as a key component from the outset of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7247">development projects.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="7268">Focus on reliability and user experience</st></strong><st c="7309">: As user expectations for reliability and performance grew, there was a shift in focus toward ensuring that software is not only delivered quickly but also reliably. </st><st c="7477">This led to the emergence of SRE, which blends aspects of software engineering with IT operations to create scalable and highly reliable </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7614">software systems.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="7631">Feedback and continuous improvement</st></strong><st c="7667">: The need for continuous feedback from </st><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><st c="7708">users and rapid adaptation to this feedback became paramount. </st><st c="7770">Agile, DevOps, and SRE methodologies all emphasize continuous monitoring, feedback, and improvement to align software products more closely with user needs and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7930">business goals.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="7945">Cultural and organizational shifts</st></strong><st c="7980">: These methodologies also represent a cultural shift in how organizations view software development, delivery, and operations. </st><st c="8109">They promote collaborative, cross-functional teams, a fail-fast mindset, and an emphasis on continuous learning </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8221">and improvement.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="8237">The evolution to Agile, DevOps, DevSecOps, and SRE has been driven by the need for faster, more efficient, and more reliable software delivery in a rapidly changing technological landscape. </st><st c="8428">These methodologies address the increasing complexity of software systems, the need for speed and reliability, the integration of security into the development process, and the importance of continuous feedback </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8639">and improvement.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8655">The historical examples presented in this section demonstrate that, from the earliest days of computing, strategies for testing, quality, security, and feedback have been critical components of software development, delivery, and operations. </st><st c="8898">These strategies have evolved with the evolution of technology but have always been integral to the development, delivery, and maintenance of reliable, secure, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9062">user-centered software.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9085">Weaknesses of traditional strategies for testing, quality, security, and feedback led to the evolution of more integrated, automated, and user-centric methodologies in software development, such as Agile, DevOps, and DevSecOps, which aim to address these shortcomings by embedding testing, quality assurance, security, and feedback deeply and</st><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><st c="9428"> continuously into the software </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9460">life cycle.</st></span></p>
