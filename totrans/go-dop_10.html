			<p>The nightmare of any DevOps engineer is the 3A.M. wake-up call that says the systems their paycheck relies on aren't working. To combat these types of problems, it is critical to have information at hand that gives you and your team insights that can be used to quickly diagnose and remediate the problem. Even better, can we avoid the situation altogether with automation?</p>
			<p>This chapter will introduce the concepts of using OpenTelemetry to enable observability across distributed applications and reduce dependency on log analysis. We will continue the journey by demonstrating how application release workflows can be automated with Go and GitHub Actions, removing the need for human interactions that can lead to downtime. Finally, we will explore using ChatOps with Slack to enable insights across teams and remove toil from engineers tasked with deployments.</p>
