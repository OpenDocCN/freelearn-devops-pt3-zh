    the last 15 years of the field. The last 5 would be enough to be competent and
    even less in some areas. Being a continuous learner allows you, if nothing else,
    to be continuously upgrading your skills. It also allows you to be more creative
    in general, especially if you learn about areas outside your field of interest.
    That is the path that leads to true leaps – when you can tie formerly unrelated
    areas together. It is hard now because there is so much information that you cannot
    know or learn everything. So, being a regular learner allows you to learn in increments
    and makes it much easier to do. In terms of impact, I have a broader background
    than other similar candidates, so that gives me a competitive advantage if nothing
    else. Anything you can do to differentiate yourself by gaining more knowledge,

    DevOps team and initiatives. I found that the most important skill as a consultant

    to coordinate travel, expenses, being on call, and working in different environments
    – sometimes without the tools necessary. As a consultant, any role you have is
    much more difficult. For example, as an employee, you do not have to worry so

    uncertainty, I make sure I go out and find those answers for folks. I make sure
    I educate myself on the subject at hand while keeping a clear mind about the topics.
    One of the things being a consultant has taught me is that I do not understand
    a solution or topic unless I can reliably, accurately, and properly argue both
    for and against that item. Being a consultant can be a stressful job. It is certainly
    not for everyone. It is less about what you know and more about how you work,

    of the known need. I like figuring out how things work, so rather than starting
    on the developer side, I came upon the Ops side. And I always had a knack for
    figuring out how to automate big, hairy, audacious things so that I could focus
    on smarter work. That was not common in my field in my early career, not like
    it is now. But there were a couple of big inflection points in the industry where

- en: The industry started moving to Agile. I was on an Ops team at IBM where some
    great engineers from Brazil were huddling around their work every day, and sort
    of socially swarming around it in a way you do not tend to see in enterprise-driven

    who I see with leadership potential. But I think when I was younger and earlier

    as it is the cool technical skills. I think learning about the **Westrum model**
    is one of the first things I would call out to make sure you are cultivating a
    high-collaboration engineering culture. I also think it's important to stay aware
    of the cultural sensitivities of underrepresented communities in tech. *Guide
    to Allyship* is a good place to start. Just being aware and mindful – those strengths
    are introduced when we make sure to include people with different backgrounds

- en: For people in an individual contributor role thinking about moving into management...
    where do I begin? I think if you are not doing well at the curious and empathetic
    points I made in the previous question, I would advise that we have already got
    too many in this field who are missing these key traits and it may not be the
    right path for you. It is important to understand that going from individual contributor
    to manager is not a *promotion*; it is more of a lateral move to a completely
    different career track. For example, just to level set, where I work now, the
    highest-ranking individual contributor that can report to a senior manager is
    a senior staff software engineer. Even though there is a supervisory relationship
    between the two, they are at the same pay grade. When someone moves from senior
    staff software engineer to senior manager (a not-uncommon move), there is initially
    some disappointment that they are not getting paid more. Even as you move up in
    management, you may have highly skilled individual contributors earning more money
    than you. I want to tell you now and keep it filed away for when this inevitably
    happens – *get over it*. The jump in compensation does not tend to happen while
    going from individual contributor to manager (within the same organization), but
    when you jump from manager to director (manager of managers of individual contributors).
    But here is the thing – you could stay in an individual contributor role and still
    get that sweet pay bump by getting a promotion to principal software engineer.
    And your reporting relationship will change, because now, you outrank your senior
    manager, and you will instead be reporting directly to their director.

  zh: 对于那些从个人贡献角色考虑转入管理层的人来说……我该从哪里开始呢？我想，如果你在之前提到的好奇心和同理心方面做得不好，我建议你考虑一下：这个领域已经有太多人缺乏这些关键特质，也许这条道路不适合你。理解从个人贡献者到管理者的转变并不是*晋升*；更像是一个横向的转变，进入完全不同的职业轨道。例如，仅仅为了让你了解我所在的公司，目前能够向高级经理汇报的最高级别的个人贡献者是高级员工软件工程师。尽管两者之间存在监管关系，但他们的薪资等级是相同的。当某人从高级员工软件工程师转变为高级经理（这并不罕见）时，最初会感到一些失望，因为他们并没有获得更高的薪资。即便你在管理层逐步晋升，你也可能会遇到技术高超的个人贡献者赚得比你多。我现在想告诉你，并且记住这一点，当这种情况不可避免地发生时——*接受现实*。在从个人贡献者转变为经理的过程中，薪资增长通常不会发生（在同一个组织内），但当你从经理晋升为总监（即管理多个经理）时，薪水才会显著增加。但问题是——你可以继续待在个人贡献者的角色，仍然通过晋升为首席软件工程师来获得更高的薪水。而且，你的汇报关系也会发生变化，因为现在你超过了你的高级经理，你将直接向他们的总监汇报。
