     Not nothing, mind you; you may still get some basic middleware capabilities such as better error logging, a retry mechanism, or some easier-to-use

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.874.2">
     From choosing the wrong integration patterns or misusing your middleware to the technical details of your concrete implementation, there are anti-patterns that can potentially cause serious problems not only to your project but also at an enterprise
