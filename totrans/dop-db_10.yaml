    match an application’s needs. As workloads increase, the database dynamically
    scales up to meet demand, guaranteeing optimal performance. Conversely, during
    periods of low demand, resources are automatically scaled down, reducing costs
    by eliminating the need to pay for idle capacity. This elasticity makes serverless
    databases highly adaptable to changing workloads, ensuring a seamless user experience
    and cost-effectiveness.

- en: Serverless databases use cloud-native technologies to abstract away a server’s
    management. They are designed to scale automatically based on workload demand.
    When demand is low, the database can scale down or even pause, reducing or eliminating
    costs. When demand increases, the database scales up rapidly to ensure continued
    performance.

- en: The underlying infrastructure of a serverless database typically consists of
    stateless compute resources and distributed storage. The stateless nature of the
    compute resources allows them to be quickly created or destroyed based on demand,
    while the distributed storage ensures data durability and availability.
