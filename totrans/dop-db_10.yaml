    by abstracting the management of physical servers. Businesses can leverage serverless
    databases without the burden of provisioning, scaling, and managing the underlying
    database infrastructure. These databases exhibit automatic scaling capabilities,
    adjusting resources based on application requirements, while businesses are billed
    only for the resources consumed. The serverless model offers notable benefits
    in terms of flexibility and cost savings, particularly for workloads with fluctuating
    or unpredictable demands.
  id: totrans-223

    details of server management. The abstracted infrastructure allows developers
    and data professionals to concentrate on application logic and data management,
    enhancing productivity and efficiency. With serverless databases, provisioning
    and configuring servers, applying patches, and managing backups are handled by
    the service provider, freeing businesses from these time-consuming tasks.
  id: totrans-224

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The automatic scaling feature of serverless databases ensures that resources
    match an application’s needs. As workloads increase, the database dynamically
    scales up to meet demand, guaranteeing optimal performance. Conversely, during
    periods of low demand, resources are automatically scaled down, reducing costs
    by eliminating the need to pay for idle capacity. This elasticity makes serverless
    databases highly adaptable to changing workloads, ensuring a seamless user experience
    and cost-effectiveness.
  id: totrans-225

- en: The pay-per-usage pricing model of serverless databases is another significant
    advantage. Businesses are billed based on the actual resources consumed, aligning
    costs directly with usage. This eliminates the need to overprovision resources,
    optimizing budget allocation. The granular billing system charges for specific
    operations performed, storage utilized, and data transferred, providing transparency

- en: Serverless databases use cloud-native technologies to abstract away a server’s
    management. They are designed to scale automatically based on workload demand.
    When demand is low, the database can scale down or even pause, reducing or eliminating
    costs. When demand increases, the database scales up rapidly to ensure continued
    performance.

    stateless compute resources and distributed storage. The stateless nature of the
    compute resources allows them to be quickly created or destroyed based on demand,
    while the distributed storage ensures data durability and availability.
