- en: The first variation of this anti-pattern starts with a **bottom-up cloud adoption
    approach** and typically provides some quick wins. Stakeholders of a digital transformation
    initiative realize that the lead times to release an application should be shorter.
    Those include waiting times such as onboarding a new vendor because various departments,
    including Legal, Procurement, and Tax, need approval, or a supplier can only deliver
    the required hardware in a few weeks. Then, the software products need to be installed,
    configured, tested, and registered in the asset registry. The sponsor then requests
    a **value stream map** that lays out the current process and timelines and compares
    them to what can be done.

  zh: 这种反模式的第一个变体始于**自下而上的云采用方法**，通常会带来一些快速的成功。数字化转型计划的利益相关者意识到，发布一个应用程序的交付时间应该更短。这些包括等待时间，例如，因为各种部门（包括法务、采购和税务）需要批准，或者供应商只能在几周后交付所需的硬件。然后，软件产品需要安装、配置、测试，并在资产登记簿中注册。接着，发起人请求一个**价值流图**，该图展示当前的流程和时间表，并与可行的方案进行对比。
- en: It turns out the teams can deliver the product in half the time if they leverage
    a **cloud native approach**. That sounds great, doesn’t it? Especially when we
    see quick wins and get confidence that the critical go-live deadline can be met.
    But long-term operational thoughts won’t get enough consideration. Standardization
    across the organization will hardly be considered because the actual viewpoint
    is the initiative, which might be a project, product, or program of a business
    domain (group of projects).

- en: The lack of standardization will impact the cultural aspects, such as **DevSecOps**
    and technology. In this scenario, we will have a business alignment with a project/product
    or product portfolio but not across the enterprise. This misalignment will result
    in an inhomogeneous culture and inconsistent technology stack across the organization.
    It is only sustainable if a business unit does not have synergies with other business
    units. In other words, the business unit is entirely self-sufficient and cannot
    leverage the common building blocks of other business units. This scenario is
    very often not the case, and it illustrates the bottom-up variation of this anti-pattern.

    negative impact on collaboration, learning, and productivity.

  zh: 这一反模式开始于组织希望自然地扩展其云端存在。结果，没有迁移计划，这导致了**云端扩展缓慢**，通常仅限于新应用程序。一些现有的本地应用程序可能由于本地可扩展性问题而被扩展到混合云解决方案中。
- en: A typical case involves a **content distribution network** (**CDN**), a web
    application firewall, an API gateway, and a queue in the cloud. The cloud native
    components can handle peak loads, and the on-premises app can pull from the queue.
    What was initially intended to be temporary can easily become permanent because
    there is no strong desire to move the rest into the cloud. After all, the team
    members have never gained sufficient migration experience. The burden here is
    that **troubleshooting** becomes more complex because errors can occur on both
    sides. It is the same with evidence collection for **compliance audits**. We have
    seen organizations that started their cloud adoption 8 years ago but only had
    20% of the workloads in the cloud, and the rest was still on-premises. The vast
    majority of the cloud applications were new applications. The problem is that
    organic growth is unlikely to gain momentum.

    Without a framework that guides us to which cloud platform to migrate to, we will
    need to make case-by-case decisions, which will take too long, and the decisions
    will not be consistent. We also do not know what the actual migration treatment
    should look like. A **treatment plan** will describe what refactoring steps we
    take to make an application more cloud-friendly. Organizations that do not have
    that framework in place make case-by-case decisions. This brings several problems.
    The decisions will not be consistent because there is a **lack of standardization**,
    which will increase the operational complexity. The decision process will take
    longer because it is not standardized. The migration process will take longer
    because every migration is treated differently. This can be a big burden on the
    application teams. Because of all the disadvantages, migrations will be perceived
    as painful and energy-draining. This will then reduce the willingness to migrate
    more applications. This results in the same outcome as the previous variation
    of this anti-pattern: we cannot leverage the full cloud native advantages because
    we are stuck in the legacy on-premises world for too long. It also means that
    we still need to continue with our data center refresh program. Once the hardware
    is renewed, we have spent considerable funding that could have been used for migrations.'

    But how can we fix it? How can we develop a structured migration strategy that
    helps us standardize migrations, flattens the learning curve, speeds up the migration
    progress, and delivers robust cloud native solutions that support business agility?
    We have seen that a slow organic approach does not help us gain momentum. Only
    once we gain momentum can we accelerate the cloud migration, increase migration
    efficiency, and improve our applications’ operational efficiency and business

    fashion. The service catalog offers reusable building blocks. Without a service
    catalog, we will have inconsistent and slow migrations. We need to set priorities
    for our service catalog items to make sure that high-impact items are implemented
    first. We also need to make sure that we address our requirements properly, including
    non-functional requirements. Otherwise, we will run into issues when we ramp up

    units could decide which consultancy they want to bring in. One third party specializing
    in software engineering and APIs was attached to one business unit and a different
    one to another, and there were consultancies specializing in AWS and a different
    one in Azure. Some consultancies had been there for years, and their technology
    frameworks had changed during the long-term engagement. Having many consultancies
    in the vendor mix, combined with changing technology stacks and patterns, made
    it obvious that there are many moving parts. It became obvious that there was
    no overarching governance. The CI/CD toolchain and applications became unmanageable.
    Of course, consultancies also have to rotate their staff, because one of the personal
    drivers of a consultant is to get new challenges frequently and not get stuck
    in one place. This needs to be considered in project plans since there is extra
    time that needs to be allocated for handovers. One of the big global consultancies
    also brought in many junior consultants to maximize its profit, and the senior
    consultants did not challenge the quality shortcomings.

    SoW. If the SoW does not reference internal CI/CD practices such as code scanning,
    branching model, CI/CD workflows, coding style guides, and observability standards,
    this should raise alarm bells. Standards and frameworks must be referenced in

    complexity, and avoidable operational complexity. It is time to act immediately

    articulate those standards, the next engagement with our trusted cloud consultancy
    should be establishing or maturing those standards. This engagement will need
    full support from the technology and business teams. It is a very strong sign

    means that governance happens outside of the organization. This is a guarantee
    for failure since this approach will not meet our organization’s needs and strategic
    direction. We need to make this standardization engagement a priority. More importantly,

- en: '**Over-privileged user permissions**: Another way to indicate we are heading
    toward this anti-pattern is to validate human permissions in our identity and
    access management roles. If no one has the skills to validate this, that should
    ring alarm bells. If we discover that humans have permissions that should not
    be needed in a mature DevSecOps culture, this is a strong indicator of the immediate
    need for training. If humans require write permissions to change either database
    schemes or ingest data into a database, there could be two reasons for this: either
    the permissions are not required or we are not following least privilege best
    practices. The likely option is that our teams are not following DevSecOps best
    practices. In this case, we have to allocate time to establish those capabilities.
    In our example, we will need data ingestion patterns articulating how tooling
    can help to import data. If the team doesn’t have experience in that area, it
    will highlight another need for training. By now, we know that learning includes

    a majority of compliance and security requirements. After a while, some team members
    of the customer’s cloud team spent 50% of their time reviewing and providing feedback.
    The mentality of the consultancy was very different compared to the previous strategic
    cloud consultancy. Their behavior was passive, and their main driver was to move
    stories from “in progress” to “done” on the Jira board. The quality was so low
    that it did not add value, and the cloud team spent more time hand-holding the
    consultants to get the quality to an acceptable level. After 6 months, 25% of
    the intended scope was delivered. It was an exhausting experience and negatively
    impacted the motivation of team members. This anti-pattern is avoidable if we

    best practices.

    We started with objectives and strategy. We called out that the cloud native strategy
    should be seen as an extension of the business strategy. We investigated bottom-up
    and bottom-down anti-patterns. We discussed how to get started on a migration
    strategy, including building a strawman, starting a business case, and gaining
    momentum. We explored the risks of knowledge outsourcing and how a lack of knowledge
    could result in mediocre quality, bringing reliability, security, compliance,
    and operational complexity challenges. We discussed the value of partnerships
    and, finally, we looked into the value of a CAF. By following a CAF, we can avoid
    common pitfalls, such as architecture gaps due to blueprint ignorance, deployment
    issues, and leaked secrets. The knowledge gained prepares us to explore the next
    problem space – rethinking governance, which we will do in the next chapter.
