			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>How Python Integrates with IaC Concepts</h1>
			<p class="author-quote">Never measure the height of a mountain until you have reached the top. Then you will see how low it was.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Dag Hammarskjöld</p>
			<p>So, as we approach this <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>penultimate chapter, we get to the topic of <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>). It is quite the topic, indeed, one that has taken the IT world by storm. It is a response to the fact that there are now more resources available for applications and workloads than there ever were before and the only thing left to do is arrange them in the most optimal way. Sure, you might find a way to do this once manually and it might work. But having to do it over and over again with a guarantee that you won’t make mistakes? That’s foolish talk and a waste <span class="No-Break">of manpower.</span></p>
			<p>So, based on these observations, the concept of IaC emerged. It posited that if resource creation, provisioning, and updating were standardized in the form of code with constants and variables arranged in an organized way, you could standardize the replication of resources, making things such as backups, failovers, re-deployments and a whole lot of other operations <span class="No-Break">activities easier.</span></p>
			<p>Of course, IaC has its detractors, because all good technology does. They believe that it is too fast, too powerful, capable of running up your cloud bill and putting up resources that become too hard to untangle and are not as <span class="No-Break">easily customizable.</span></p>
			<p>It’s an interesting thought, but when I look at IaC, I am reminded of the initial passage in Adam Smith’s <em class="itali">Wealth of Nations</em> where he talks about how the division of labor increases production more than any other factor. IaC concepts do the same, where the labor (resources) is separated from the schematics that build them, allowing them to be produced over and <span class="No-Break">over again.</span></p>
			<p>Python<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> as a language has been very friendly towards <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>IaC, perhaps the second-most behind Go. There are a lot of native IaC libraries and stacks in Python (which we will cover), in addition to modules and APIs to interact with IaC tools not written in Python. The flexibility of Python and the desire for loose, yet strict replication that comes with IaC allowed Python to become such a huge part of the growing <span class="No-Break">IaC trend.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter will help you with a concept in IaC that is considered unique to DevOps, one that was created to fuel the constant need for automation and standardization in a DevOps workload. It will help you understand why DevOps and coding need to be so closely related to each other. That is why, in this chapter, you will learn <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The basics of <strong class="bold">SaltStack</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> how it is built in Python along with how to evaluate SaltStack modules at the code and <span class="No-Break">command-line levels</span></li>
				<li>The basics of <strong class="bold">Ansible</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> how to create your own automated <span class="No-Break">Ansible module</span></li>
				<li>How you can use Python to interact with other IaC tools, such as Terraform, to add automation on top of already <span class="No-Break">built automation</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>In order to pursue this chapter to its logical conclusion, you will need to fulfill a few <span class="No-Break">technical requirements:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Installation of Python with<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> the <strong class="bold">Salt library</strong> <span class="No-Break">and Ansible</span></li>
				<li>Installation of NPM and NodeJS <span class="No-Break">with </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="sour e-inline">cdktf</strong></span></li>
				<li>Installation of <span class="No-Break">Terraform CLI</span></li>
				<li>An AWS and a <span class="No-Break">GCP account</span></li>
				<li>A GitHub account to retrieve the repository for this <span class="No-Break">book (</span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Python-for-DevOps"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Python-for-DevOps</span></a><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>A significant amount of patience <span class="No-Break">and understanding</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Automation and customization with Python’s Salt library</h1>
			<p>We talk about<a id="_idIndexMarker384"/> all of these fancy architectures and <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>frameworks that we want to make; we talk about all of<a id="_idIndexMarker386"/> these different tools that we want to use, all of these workflows, and they are fun. They are very exciting, but the thing that a lot of DevOps still boils down to is server management; the Ops side of DevOps. It is still important and relevant in today’s world and will be for as long as people use it, which is <span class="No-Break">likely forever.</span></p>
			<p>Server management in the modern day requires the creation of modern, custom environments based on the requirements of the application being hosted. It also requires a lot of automation features to be maintained and to stay in an optimized state based on <span class="No-Break">present circumstances.</span></p>
			<p>The radio was never replaced by the television, and television in turn probably won’t be replaced by streaming completely. Everything changes, evolves, or reduces down, but the thing itself and the skills needed to use it will be relevant in one way or another. This is why the tools for server management will always be there and they <span class="No-Break">will evolve.</span></p>
			<p>That’s what the Salt library (used interchangeably with SaltStack) is used for. In essence, it consists of a central server that can be used to send commands to all servers connected to it. The requirements are that the minion (server to be managed) is configured to receive commands from the master (server that does the managing). It’s a pretty simple concept, executed using only the finest <span class="No-Break">Python code.</span></p>
			<p>So, let’s get into it. We will start with the installation of a Salt server and a minion, and then, we will see how we can customize the Python code that comprises Salt <span class="No-Break">if needed.</span></p>
			<p>The architecture of the Salt library consists of, as we said, a master and several minions. So, let’s start by creating servers that mirror <span class="No-Break">this configuration:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>We will create one master server and a minion in GCP, and one minion in AWS to show cross-cloud functionality. For this exercise, we are using Ubuntu as our primary <strong class="bold">operating system</strong> (<strong class="bold">OS</strong>), but other OSs will work just as well. We will make a minion and a master Salt instance <span class="No-Break">in GCP:</span></li>
			</ol>

			<ol>
				<li value="2">We <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>will also <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>add a <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>minion instance <span class="No-Break">in AWS:</span></li>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2 – Salt instance in AWS</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Now, we can SSH into the <strong class="sour e-inline">salt-master</strong> instance and install the Salt <span class="No-Break">master library:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">sudo apt install salt-master</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">After this, you can run <strong class="sour e-inline">salt-master --version</strong> to run a check on the installation and get the version, similar to <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p></li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.3 – Salt master version</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Next, install the Salt minion library in both of the minion instances using the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">sudo apt install salt-minion</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">Then, run <strong class="sour e-inline">salt-minion --version</strong> in order to verify installation and get the version, similar to <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p></li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.4 – Salt minion version</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Next, go back<a id="_idIndexMarker390"/> to the Salt master and <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>run the<a id="_idIndexMarker392"/> <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">sudo nano /etc/salt/master</strong></pre></li>
				<li>After we have done so, we will insert the following lines at the bottom to account for interfacing between the master and <span class="No-Break">the minions:</span><pre class="sour e- ode">interface: 0.0.0.0
publish_port: 4505
ret_port: 4506
auto_accept: True</pre></li>
				<li>Next, we will run <strong class="sour e-inline">sudo systemctl start salt-master</strong> to initialize the Salt master system module, then run the <strong class="sour e-inline">sudo systemctl status salt-master</strong> command to get the status of the Salt master. When we run the command, we get something like <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.5 – Running Salt master server</p>
			<p>That is a running Salt master; now, we need to configure <span class="No-Break">our minions.</span></p>
			<p>The steps to configuring the minions are similar to those for the master, but with a few differences, as we will <span class="No-Break">explore here:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>On each<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> minion, run <strong class="sour e-inline">sudo nano /etc/salt/minion</strong>, and <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>in the <strong class="sour e-inline">nano</strong> file, enter <span class="No-Break">the </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker395"/></span><span class="No-Break">following:</span><pre class="sour e- ode">master: &lt;salt_master_ip&gt;</pre><p class="list-inset">Replace <strong class="sour e-inline">salt_master_ip</strong> with the IP of your Salt <span class="No-Break">master server.</span></p></li>
				<li>Then, run <strong class="sour e-inline">sudo systemctl start salt-minion</strong>, which will initialize the minion. Then, run <strong class="sour e-inline">sudo systemctl status salt-minion</strong> to check whether the minion <span class="No-Break">is running:</span></li>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.6 – Running Salt minion</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Now, on the Salt master, you can run a little example command <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">sudo salt '*' test.ping</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>That’s the basics of it. Now, let’s move to the part where we look at the Python code a <span class="No-Break">little closer.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s break down a particular Salt module so that we can learn the intricacies <span class="No-Break">behind it:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Each Salt module is a Python function that can be called. Let’s take one module as an example from the documentation, in this case, the one for <span class="No-Break">network connections:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer148" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_12_7.jpg" alt="Figure 12.7 – Salt module from﻿ the documentation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.7 – Salt module from the documentation</p>
			<p class="list-inset">This is great documentation! It shows you the function and the CLI version <span class="No-Break">for it.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Let’s look<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> at <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/><span class="No-Break">the </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker398"/></span><span class="No-Break">function:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">connect(host, port=None, **kwargs)</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">The <strong class="sour e-inline">connect</strong> function takes a hostname compulsorily and it takes a port number optionally. It also includes <strong class="sour e-inline">**kwargs,</strong> which is just a large number of arguments such as <strong class="sour e-inline">proto</strong> and <strong class="sour e-inline">timeout</strong> that the function may have. The following command connects to a <span class="No-Break">DNS instance:</span></p><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">salt '*' network.connect google-public-dns-a.google.com port=53 proto=udp timeout=3</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">The preceding command is for connecting to a Google public DNS with the <strong class="sour e-inline">connect</strong> function. An equivalent in code would be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">connect("google-public-dns-a.google.com", port = 53, proto = "udp", timeout = 3)</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">These two commands are equivalent, but you can see the pragmatism in running them from the command line, as these commands are far more comfortable in that way than <span class="No-Break">as functions.</span></p><p class="list-inset">That stands <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>true for a lot of <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>command-line tools and is the reason that a lot of them exist in the<a id="_idIndexMarker401"/> <span class="No-Break">first place.</span></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Next, we will look at Ansible, which has a similar idea to execute but takes a slightly different approach while still <span class="No-Break">using Python.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>How Ansible works and the Python code behind it</h1>
			<p>A lot of this section will be more of the same that you saw in the previous section, similar tools, similar implementations, and whatnot. But, like SaltStack, this too is an important and very common tool in the IaC realm, which is why it deserves the coverage that we are giving it. Ansible is powerful, its learning curve is probably not as steep as that of SaltStack, and it is easier on users who like more cleanly pre-packaged code that they don’t have to modify too much. Oh, and it’s also written <span class="No-Break">in Python.</span></p>
			<p>Ansible is run and maintained by IBM under its Red Hat label (I like that tech companies have their own <em class="itali">DC Vertigo</em>-esque labels for their more risque stuff now; it really makes the things I say about it being an art even more true). It is meant to maintain and affect servers using SSH key pairs to access those servers. That simplifies some things, such as when you control a server and all the<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> associated servers are in the same <strong class="bold">virtual private </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">cloud</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">VPC</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>Ansible<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> is a bit more flexible in terms of the OSs that you can control with it, but for this exercise, we will use old, reliable Ubuntu. With all that exposition out of the way, let’s get into the finicky details of Ansible and give you a little sample of how <span class="No-Break">it works.</span></p>
			<p>We will be reusing the same <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>instances used during the Salt exercise for this, so let’s start with the <span class="No-Break">master instance:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Let’s start by using <strong class="sour e-inline">pip</strong> to install Ansible on <span class="No-Break">the system:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">pip install ansible ansible-inventory</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">Sometimes you may need to install <strong class="sour e-inline">pip</strong> as well, though that is not a frequent occurrence. Let’s run this command and <span class="No-Break">install Ansible:</span></p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer149" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_12_8.jpg" alt="Figure 12.8 – Successful Ansible installation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.8 – Successful Ansible installation</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Once you have done this, make a directory to use as the common Ansible configuration directory and go <span class="No-Break">into it:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">mkdir ansible_project</strong>
<strong class="bold">cd ansible_project</strong></pre></li>
				<li>The next thing to<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> do is to create an <strong class="sour e-inline">inventory.ini</strong> file, which will serve the same function as the master IP in SaltStack but in reverse, with the IPs of the servers being controlled and placed in the <span class="No-Break">controlling server.</span></li>
				<li>Run <strong class="sour e-inline">sudo nano inventory.ini</strong>, which will create the inventory file, and place a list of IP addresses that you want to run <span class="No-Break">in there:</span><pre class="sour e- ode">[myhosts]
&lt;IP_1&gt;
&lt;IP_2&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>Now, you can run the <strong class="sour e-inline">ansible-inventory -i inventory.ini --list</strong> command and this will give you the following list <span class="No-Break">of hosts:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer150" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_12_9.jpg" alt="Figure 12.9 - Ansible inventory"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.9 - Ansible inventory</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Next, you can ping these hosts to test your connection with the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">ansible myhosts -m ping -i inventory.ini</strong></pre></li>
				<li>Now, you can run playbooks and runbooks through a centralized command server and you can even sort the hosts into fleets just by changing the <span class="No-Break">inventory list.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Those are the basics of <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>Ansible; now, let’s look a little deeper and find the Python behind the CLI as we did with SaltStack. We will do so by creating a custom module to use with Ansible. We’ll keep it local this time, but this is basically how you run custom operations with Ansible all <span class="No-Break">the time.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s create a new Ansible module, custom-made <span class="No-Break">by us:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the environment where you have installed Ansible, create a <strong class="sour e-inline">hello_ansible.py</strong> file and add the following code <span class="No-Break">to it:</span><pre class="sour e- ode">from ansible.module_utils.basic import AnsibleModule
def join_strings(string_1, string_2):
    return string_1+string_2
def main():
    module_args = dict(
        string_1=dict(type='str', required=True),
        string_2=dict(type='str', required=True),
    )
    result = dict(changed=False, message="" )
    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=module_args,
        supports_check_mode=True
    )
    string_1 = module.params['string_1']
    string_2 = module.params['string_2']
    result["message"] = string_1 + " " + string_2
    module.exit_json(**result)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()</pre><p class="list-inset">That gives us the<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> Python code that will be executed and now we need to change the Python code’s permissions into something executable. We do this by using the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span></p><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">chmod +x hello_ansible.py</strong></pre></li>
				<li>Next, we need to make a playbook to run the function locally, and for that, we can create a playbook called <strong class="sour e-inline">hello.yml</strong> and add some code <span class="No-Break">to it:</span><pre class="sour e- ode">---
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Hello World
      add_numbers:
        string_1: Hello
        string_2: Ansible
      register: result
    - debug:
        var: result</pre></li>
				<li>Now, execute the <span class="No-Break">YAML file:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">ansible-playbook -M . hello.yml</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">This will give you a result as a string, shown <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer151" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_12_10.jpg" alt="Figure 12.10 – Result of ﻿our Ansible module"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.10 – Result of our Ansible module</p>
			<p class="list-inset">That is how you <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>create a customized Ansible module. This module will give you the sum of two strings that you put into it, perhaps the most basic operation that you can do with a module. But everything else is the same, even for more complex operations. Just replace <strong class="sour e-inline">join_strings</strong> in the code with the function of your choice and add the variables needed to execute that function and return the resulting value. Maybe, for example, it could be a function to restart a server or run a particular CLI command; it can be practically anything that you can do on a command line in the OS that you <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/><span class="No-Break">are using.</span></p>
			<p>Now, even this is a little bit underpowered in terms of the resources that you can use and the way that you can use them. It is useful for more conventional systems, but for systems that require unconventional architectures, something like Terraform is better suited. We will now discuss how we can use Terraform with Python to automate IaC <span class="No-Break">even further.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Automate the automation of IaC with Python</h1>
			<p>IaC has <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>grown in popularity and in ways that people have<a id="_idIndexMarker411"/> never imagined. The most popular IaC framework currently is arguably Terraform. Terraform doesn’t just work on servers and more solid resources of the like, it works on APIs and looser infrastructure as well. Basically, anything that you can use in any major cloud, there is a Terraform API to use it. Terraform is the ultimate automation tool in many ways, and it can be further automated with the help <span class="No-Break">of Python.</span></p>
			<p>Terraform is, of course, written in Go, which is great because Go is a very good complement to Python. One is good where the other lack<a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>s and vice versa. While Go is good for singular implementations, Python is great at multiplying the effectiveness of that implementation. Basically, Go is the bullet and Python is the gun, and that is an effective combination. We will use this combination to great effect in <span class="No-Break">this section.</span></p>
			<p>HashiCorp, the <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>creator of Terraform, has created APIs that allow Python to<a id="_idIndexMarker413"/> interact with Terraform. These APIs are packaged in the <strong class="sour e-inline">cdktf</strong> library published by HashiCorp in a number of languages. Let’s take a look at the steps we need to perform to install and run the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="sour e-inline">cdktf</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> library:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>You need to first have NPM, NodeJS, and the Terraform CLI installed to <span class="No-Break">install </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="sour e-inline">cdktf-cli</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">npm install -g cdktf-cli</strong></pre></li>
				<li>Next, you can use the <strong class="sour e-inline">cdktf</strong> to create a <span class="No-Break">Python environment:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">cdktf init --template=python</strong></pre></li>
				<li>This will create a new Python template, which can be used then to run a Terraform template. In the template, you can find the <strong class="sour e-inline">main.py</strong> file in the <strong class="sour e-inline">stacks</strong> folder. In the folder, you can add <span class="No-Break">this script:</span><pre class="sour e- ode">from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import App, TerraformStack
from imports.aws import AwsProvider, S3Bucket
class MyStack(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, ns: str):
        super().__init__(scope, ns)
        AwsProvider(self, 'Aws', region='us-east-1')
        S3Bucket(
            self,
            '&lt;Terraform_Function_Name&gt;',
            bucket=&lt;'Bucket_Name_Here&gt;',
            acl='private'
        )
app = App()
MyStack(app, "python-cdktf")
app.synth()</pre></li>
				<li>This code is<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> simple enough to understand; it <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>works exactly like an IaC module would, creating an S3 bucket with the name given at the time of your execution of the program. To execute the program, run the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">cdktf deploy</strong></pre></li>
				<li>If you want to revert the program and simply delete the resource that you created, you can just run the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">cdktf destroy</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>That is basically <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>all you need to do. The AWS, Google Cloud, and <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>Azure modules for Terraform are usually included with the installation, as are the equivalent Python libraries when they are installed using <strong class="sour e-inline">cdktf</strong>. You can find the documentation for all of these libraries and what they do on HashiCorp’s GitHub and on its website. HashiCorp is very clear about the things that its products can do, even if it is sometimes difficult to collate all of that information in one place. So, using these references, you can practically create any resource you want; it is all up to <span class="No-Break">your imagination.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>So, that is the chapter, one that was a little more serious than the ones you might have been used to, but this is serious business. IaC is a concept to be taken seriously; it is very powerful and can be the solution to a lot of problems that require the application of <span class="No-Break">DevOps principles.</span></p>
			<p>We initially looked at a very basic application of IaC using Python in SaltStack. It was quite rudimentary but very effective for simple projects. We closed it out by diving into the guts of SaltStack and understanding the logic behind its <span class="No-Break">Python modules.</span></p>
			<p>After that, we looked at the slightly more flexible Ansible and discovered all of the conveniences that it provides as well as the <span class="No-Break">customization possibilities.</span></p>
			<p>Lastly, we looked at Terraform and <strong class="sour e-inline">cdktf</strong>, which is used with Python Terraform and resource modules in order to perform Terraform’s <span class="No-Break">resource creation.</span></p>
			<p>All of this has hopefully helped you gain a new perspective on IaC and allowed you to understand its importance in DevOps and its integration <span class="No-Break">with Python.</span></p>
			<p>In conclusion, IaC is powerful, vast, and useful to learn. In the next chapter, we will take all that you have learned here and in the previous chapters, and raise it all to a <span class="No-Break">higher level.</span></p>
