<h1 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Git, Your Doorway to DevOps</h1>
<p>Git is a <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>free and open source <strong class="bold">version control system</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>) that is widely used by software developers and teams to track changes to their code base and collaborate on projects. It allows multiple people to work on the same code base without overwriting each other’s changes, and it keeps a record of every change made to the code, making it easy to roll back to a previous version <span class="No-Break">if necessary.</span></p>
<p>Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel, and it has since become the de facto standard for version control in the software industry. It is used by millions of developers worldwide and is supported by a large and active open <span class="No-Break">source community.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the most commonly used Git commands and how to use them. We will start with the basics of setting up a Git repository and making your first commit, and then move on to more advanced topics such as branching <span class="No-Break">and merging.</span></p>
<p>The chapter will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Basic <span class="No-Break">Git commands</span></li>
<li>Local versus remote <span class="No-Break">Git repositories</span></li>
<li>GitFlow and <span class="No-Break">GitHub Flow</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-119">Technical requirements</h1>
<p>In this chapter, you will need a system with a Bash shell. You will have to have the Git command available or be able to install it in this system. We prefer Linux or macOS systems, but it is possible to set up Windows to have functional Bash and Git. The installation of this environment is beyond the scope of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-120">Basic Git commands</h1>
<p>There are many commands that you can use with Git, but some of the most commonly used ones include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git config</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>is the command used to configure your local Git environment. The configuration can be global; the values will then be kept in your home directory in the <strong class="source-inline">.gitconfig</strong> file. The values can only be set per repository, and then they will be kept within <span class="No-Break">the repository.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git init</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>initializes a new Git repository. When you run this command in a directory, it creates a new <strong class="source-inline">.git</strong> directory in the root of the project, which is used to track changes made to the <span class="No-Break">project’s files.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git clone</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>creates a local copy of a remote Git repository. When you run this command, it creates a new directory with the same name as the repository and clones all of the files and their history into <span class="No-Break">that directory.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git add</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker561"/> stages files for commit. When you make changes to a file in a Git repository, those changes are not automatically tracked. You must use the <strong class="source-inline">git add</strong> command to tell Git to track changes you <span class="No-Break">have made.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git commit</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> saves your changes to the Git repository. When you run this command, it opens a text editor for you to write a commit message, which is a short description of the changes you have made. After you write the commit message and save it, the changes you have made are saved to the repository, and a new commit <span class="No-Break">is created.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git push</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>sends your local commits to a remote repository. When you run this command, it pushes all of your local commits to the remote repository, updating the project’s history and making your changes visible to other developers working on <span class="No-Break">the project.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git pull</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> retrieves updates from a remote repository and merges them into your local repository. When you run this command, it fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local repository, bringing your copy of the project up <span class="No-Break">to date.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git branch</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>creates, lists, or deletes branches in a Git repository. Branches allow you to work on multiple versions of a project simultaneously and are often used for feature development or <span class="No-Break">bug fixes.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git checkout</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">git switch</strong>: This switches between branches or restores<a id="_idIndexMarker566"/> files<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> in your working directory. When you run this command, it switches your working directory to the branch you specify or restores the specified files to their state at a <span class="No-Break">previous commit.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>merges one branch into another. When you run this command, it combines the changes made in the specified branch into the current branch, creating a new commit that represents the <span class="No-Break">combined changes.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">git stash</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> temporarily stores changes that you are not ready to commit. When you run this command, it saves your changes to a temporary area and restores your working directory to the state it was in at the last commit. You can later use the <strong class="source-inline">git stash apply</strong> command to restore the stashed changes to your <span class="No-Break">working directory.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Configuring the local Git environment</h2>
<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>using the Git command, there are at least two options you should set. They are your name and your email address. This is done using the <strong class="source-inline">git config</strong> command. Ahead, I am going to demonstrate setting up the name of the Git user and their email address. We are going to set up the global variables. They will be used by default for every repository cloned locally unless set up specifically for <span class="No-Break">a repository:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~$ git config –global user.name "Damian Wojsław"
admin@myhome:~$ git config –global user.email damian@example.com</pre>
<p>Now, when<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> we take a look at the <strong class="source-inline">~/.gitconfig</strong> file, we will see <span class="No-Break">this section:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
# This is Git's per-user configuration file
[user]
    name = Damian Wojsław
    email = damian@example.com</pre>
<p>There are more configuration options, such as default editor, and so on, but they are out of scope for<a id="_idTextAnchor152"/> <span class="No-Break">this section.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Setting up a local Git repository</h2>
<p>Before you <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>can start using Git, you need to create a <strong class="bold">repository</strong> (also known as a <strong class="bold">repo</strong>). A repository <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>is a directory where Git stores all the files and metadata for <span class="No-Break">a project.</span></p>
<p>To create a new repository, you <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>can use the <strong class="source-inline">git init</strong> command. This creates a new directory with a <strong class="source-inline">.git</strong> subdirectory, which contains all the necessary files for <span class="No-Break">the repository.</span></p>
<p>For example, to create a new repository in the current directory, you can run the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~$ mkdir git-repository &amp;&amp; cd git-repository
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git init</pre>
<p>This creates a new repository in the current directory and sets up the necessary files and metadata. Once you have a Git repository set up, you can start adding and committing files <span class="No-Break">to it.</span></p>
<p>To add a file to the repository, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">git add</strong> command. This adds the file to the staging area, which is a list of changes that will be included in the <span class="No-Break">next commit.</span></p>
<p>To add a file called <strong class="source-inline">main.c</strong> to the staging area, you can run the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git add main.py</pre>
<p>You can also add multiple files or directories by separating their names with <span class="No-Break">a space:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git add main.py utils.py directory/</pre>
<p>To commit <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>changes in the staging area, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">git commit</strong> command. This creates a new commit that includes all changes in the <span class="No-Break">staging area.</span></p>
<p>Every commit needs to have a commit message. This is a short description of the changes you’re making. To specify a commit message, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">-m</strong> option followed by <span class="No-Break">the message:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git commit -m "Added main.py and additional utils"</pre>
<p>You can also use the <strong class="source-inline">git commit</strong> command without the <strong class="source-inline">-m</strong> option to open a text editor where you can write a more detailed <span class="No-Break">commit message.</span></p>
<p>On every step while working in your Git repository, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">git status</strong> command. This is used to view the current state of a Git repository. It shows which files have been modified, added, or deleted, and whether they have been staged <span class="No-Break">for commit.</span></p>
<p>There are numerous ways to format a commit message, and almost every project has its own convention. In general, a good practice is to add an ID of <strong class="source-inline">issue</strong> from the ticketing system, followed by a short description that has 72 characters or fewer. The second line should be left empty, and a more detailed description follows on line three. Here’s an example of such a <span class="No-Break">commit message:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
[TICKET-123] Adding main.py and utils.py
main.py contains the root module of the application and is a default entry point for a Docker image.
utils.py contains helper functions for setting up the environment and reading configuration from the file.
Co-authors: other-commiter@myproject.example</pre>
<p>When you run <strong class="source-inline">git status</strong>, it will display a list of modified files, as well as any untracked files that are present in the repository. It will also show the current branch and the<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> status of the <span class="No-Break">staging area.</span></p>
<p>Here is an example of the output of the <strong class="source-inline">git </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">status</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> command:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   main.py
        deleted:    root/__init__.py
Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
        ui/main.py
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</pre>
<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>example, <strong class="source-inline">git status</strong> shows that two files have been modified (<strong class="source-inline">main.py</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">__init__.py</strong>) and one file is untracked (<strong class="source-inline">main.py</strong>). It also indicates that the current branch is <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> and that the branch is up to date with the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">origin/main</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> branch.</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git status</strong> is a useful tool to understand the current state of your repository and to identify which files have been modified and need to be committed. You can use it to get a quick overview of changes that have been made and to see which files are ready to be committed. You can also use it to see which branch you are currently on, and whether you are up to date with the <span class="No-Break">remote repository.</span></p>
<p>The <strong class="source-inline">git revert</strong> command is used to undo changes that have been made to a repository. It does this by creating a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a <span class="No-Break">previous commit.</span></p>
<p>For example, imagine that you have made several commits to your repository, and you want to undo the changes introduced by the last commit. You can use the <strong class="source-inline">git revert</strong> command to <span class="No-Break">do this:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git revert HEAD</pre>
<p>This will create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the last commit. The commit history of your repository will now look as if the last commit <span class="No-Break">never happened.</span></p>
<p>You can also use the <strong class="source-inline">git revert</strong> command to undo the changes introduced by a specific commit. To do this, you need to specify the commit hash of the commit that you want <span class="No-Break">to revert:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git revert abc123</pre>
<p>This will create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the commit with the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">abc123</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> hash.</span></p>
<p>It is <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>important to note that <strong class="source-inline">git revert</strong> does not delete commits or destroy history. Instead, it creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit. This means that the changes are still present in the repository, but they are no longer visible in the current state of <span class="No-Break">the branch.</span></p>
<p>If you need to permanently delete commits, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">git reset</strong> command or the <strong class="source-inline">git filter-branch</strong> command. However, these commands can permanently destroy history, so you should use them with <span class="No-Break">extreme caution.</span></p>
<p>Now that we know how to work on our local repository, we can talk about remote and local copies of <span class="No-Break">the repository.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-123">Local versus remote Git repositories</h1>
<p>In Git, a <strong class="bold">repository</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>collection of files and their history, as well as configuration files that are used to manage the repository. A repository can be either local <span class="No-Break">or remote.</span></p>
<p>A <strong class="bold">local repository</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker580"/> repository that is stored on your local machine. When you initialize a new Git repository using the <strong class="source-inline">git init</strong> command or when you clone <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>an existing repository using the <strong class="source-inline">git clone</strong> command, you are creating a local repository. Local repositories are useful for working on projects when you don’t have an internet connection or when you want to keep a copy of the project on your <span class="No-Break">own machine.</span></p>
<p>A <strong class="bold">remote repository</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> repository that is stored on a server and accessed over the internet. When you push commits to a remote repository using the <strong class="source-inline">git push</strong> command, you are updating the remote repository with your local changes. Remote repositories are useful for collaborating with other developers, as they allow multiple people to work on the same project and share their changes with <span class="No-Break">each other.</span></p>
<p>Git uses a distributed VCS, which means that each developer has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine. This allows developers to work on the project locally and push their changes to a remote repository when they are ready to share them with others. It also allows developers to collaborate on a project even when they are not connected to <span class="No-Break">the internet.</span></p>
<p>The <strong class="source-inline">git clone</strong> command<a id="_idIndexMarker583"/> is used to create a local copy of a remote Git repository. When you run this command, it creates a new directory with the same name as the repository and clones all of the files and their history into <span class="No-Break">that directory.</span></p>
<p>Here is an example of how you might use the <strong class="source-inline">git </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">clone</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> command:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ <strong class="source-inline">git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git</strong></pre>
<p>This will create a new directory called <strong class="source-inline">repo</strong> and clone the repository located at<a href="https://github.com/user/repo.git"> https://github.com/user/repo.git</a> into <span class="No-Break">that directory.</span></p>
<p>You can also specify a different name for the local directory by adding it as <span class="No-Break">an argument:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git my-local-repo</pre>
<p>This will create a new directory called <strong class="source-inline">my-local-repo</strong> and clone the repository <span class="No-Break">into it.</span></p>
<p>If you are using a Git hosting service such as GitHub, you can also use a shorthand version of the <span class="No-Break">repository URL:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ <strong class="source-inline">git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git</strong></pre>
<p>This will clone the repository using the SSH protocol, which requires you to have an SSH key configured for <span class="No-Break">your account.</span></p>
<p>The <strong class="source-inline">git clone</strong> command is a useful way to create a local copy of a remote repository, whether you are starting a new project or contributing to an existing one. It allows you to work on a project locally and push your changes back to the remote repository when you <span class="No-Break">are ready.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Interacting with remote repositories</h2>
<p>The <strong class="source-inline">git pull</strong> command<a id="_idIndexMarker584"/> is used to retrieve updates from a remote repository and merge them into your local repository. It is a combination of the <strong class="source-inline">git fetch</strong> command, which downloads updates from the remote repository, and the <strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong> command, which merges updates into your <span class="No-Break">local repository.</span></p>
<p>The <strong class="source-inline">git fetch</strong> command<a id="_idIndexMarker585"/> downloads updates from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local repository. Instead, it stores the updates in a temporary area called <em class="italic">remote-tracking branches</em>. You can use the <strong class="source-inline">git fetch</strong> command to update your remote-tracking branches and see which changes are available, but you will need to use the <strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong> command to actually incorporate those changes into your <span class="No-Break">local repository.</span></p>
<p>Here are some common keywords that you might use when working with <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">git fetch</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="source-inline">origin</strong>: This is the default name for the remote repository that you cloned from. You can use <strong class="source-inline">origin</strong> to specify the remote repository that you want to fetch updates from. It’s also possible to change the default name and add multiple <span class="No-Break">remote repositories.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">main</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">master</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">master</strong> is the name of the default branch in a Git repository. <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> is the new default name introduced in the <span class="No-Break">GitHub platform.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">REMOTE_HEAD</strong>: This is a special reference that points to the <strong class="source-inline">head</strong> commit of the branch on the remote repository. You can use <strong class="source-inline">REMOTE_HEAD</strong> to fetch updates for the branch that is currently checked out on the <span class="No-Break">remote repository.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">HEAD</strong>: This is a special reference that points to the <strong class="source-inline">head</strong> commit of the current branch in your <span class="No-Break">local repository.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of using <strong class="source-inline">git fetch</strong> to update the main branch on the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">origin</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> repository:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git fetch origin main
From gitlab.com:gstlt/git-repository
 * branch            main       -&gt; FETCH_HEAD</pre>
<p>This will download updates for the <strong class="source-inline">master</strong> branch on the <strong class="source-inline">origin</strong> repository and store them in the <strong class="source-inline">origin/master</strong> <span class="No-Break">remote-tracking branch.</span></p>
<p>You can then use the <strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong> command to merge the updates into your <span class="No-Break">local repository:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git merge origin/main
Already up to date.</pre>
<p>This will <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>incorporate the updates from the <strong class="source-inline">origin/master</strong> remote-tracking branch into your local <strong class="source-inline">master</strong> branch. In this case, we do not have anything to <span class="No-Break">be merged.</span></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">git pull</strong> command to accomplish both steps in a <span class="No-Break">single command:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git pull origin main
Already up to date.</pre>
<p>This will fetch the updates from the <strong class="source-inline">origin</strong> repository and merge them into your local repository unless you’ve configured your Git client, as we suggested at the beginning of this chapter—in this case, Git will try to rebase against the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> branch in a <span class="No-Break">remote repository.</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git rebase</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong> are commands that are both used to integrate changes from one branch into another branch. However, they work in slightly different ways and have different implications for <span class="No-Break">your repository.</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git rebase</strong> is a command that is used to apply a series of commits from one branch into another branch. When you run <strong class="source-inline">git rebase</strong>, it looks at commits that are present in the target branch but not in the source branch, and applies them one by one to the source branch. This has the effect of <em class="italic">replaying</em> the commits from the source branch on top of the <span class="No-Break">target branch.</span></p>
<p>For example, imagine that you have two branches in your repository: <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">develop</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> represents the main development branch, and <strong class="source-inline">develop</strong> represents a feature that you are working on. If you make several commits to the <strong class="source-inline">develop</strong> branch and then run <strong class="source-inline">git rebase main</strong>, Git will apply those commits to the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> branch one by one, as if you had made them directly on the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">main</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> branch.</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong>, however, is a command that is used to combine changes from one branch into another branch. When you run <strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong>, it looks at changes that are present in the source branch and applies them to the target branch in a single commit. This has the effect of creating a new commit on the target branch that incorporates all changes from the <span class="No-Break">source branch.</span></p>
<p>For example, you <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>have the same two branches as in the rebase example: <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">develop</strong>. If you make several commits to the <strong class="source-inline">develop</strong> branch and then run <strong class="source-inline">git merge develop</strong>, Git will create a new commit on the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> branch that incorporates all of the changes from the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">develop</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> branch.</span></p>
<p>Both <strong class="source-inline">git rebase</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong> are useful tools for integrating changes from one branch into another, but they have different implications for your repository. <strong class="source-inline">git rebase</strong> keeps a linear history and avoids unnecessary additional (merge) commits, but it can also cause conflicts if the target branch has been modified since the source branch <span class="No-Break">was created.</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong> is a more straightforward way to combine changes, but it can create a lot of merge commits, which can make the history of the repository more difficult to read, even with <span class="No-Break">graphical tools.</span></p>
<p>Before merging or rebasing our local repository against a remote version of it, it’s useful to check what the differences are between the two. For that purpose, we have the <strong class="source-inline">git </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">diff</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> command.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>What’s the git diff command?</h2>
<p>The <strong class="source-inline">git diff</strong> command<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> is used to compare changes that have been made to a repository. It shows the differences between two versions of a file or between two branches in the repository (local <span class="No-Break">or remote).</span></p>
<p>Here are some common uses of the <strong class="source-inline">git </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">diff</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> command.</span></p>
<p>Compare the differences between the current state of a file and the most <span class="No-Break">recent commit:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git diff path/to/file</pre>
<p>This will show the differences between the current state of the file and the version that was <span class="No-Break">last committed.</span></p>
<p>Compare the differences between <span class="No-Break">two commits:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git diff hash1 hash2</pre>
<p>This will show the differences between the two commits <span class="No-Break">you’ve provided.</span></p>
<p>Compare the differences between a branch and its <span class="No-Break">upstream branch:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git diff branch-name @{u}</pre>
<p>This will show the differences between the specified branch and its upstream <span class="No-Break">counterpart branch.</span></p>
<p>Compare<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> the differences between the staging area and the most <span class="No-Break">recent commit:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git diff --staged</pre>
<p>This will show the differences between changes that have been added to the staging area and the most <span class="No-Break">recent commit.</span></p>
<p>If you’ve already added some files to be committed but want to double-check before creating a commit, you can use the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git diff --cached</pre>
<p>This will show you all the changes to files you’ve performed the <strong class="source-inline">git add</strong> <span class="No-Break">command on.</span></p>
<p>To compare local and remote branches of the same repository, you will need to refer to the remote branch, which can be done by executing <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">git diff</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git diff main origin/main</pre>
<p><strong class="source-inline">origin/main</strong> refers to a remote branch where the remote repository is named as <span class="No-Break">an “origin.”</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git diff</strong> is useful for understanding what changed in the Git repository and how those changes will be incorporated when you commit them. You can use the various options and arguments of the <strong class="source-inline">git diff</strong> command to specify versions of the files or branches you want <span class="No-Break">to compare.</span></p>
<p>Since we’ve covered comparing changes in your repository, there’s one particular case where this is a highly useful skill to have: solving conflicts in your repository while r<a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>ebasing or merging <span class="No-Break">your changes.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Viewing the commit history</h2>
<p>Git keeps a<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> record of every commit made to a repository, and you can view the commit history using the <strong class="source-inline">git log</strong> command. This displays a list of all commits in the repository, along with their commit messages and the date they <span class="No-Break">were made.</span></p>
<p>Some common use cases for the <strong class="source-inline">git log</strong> command include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Reviewing the history of a repository</strong>: You can use <strong class="source-inline">git log</strong> to view the entire commit history of a repository, including changes that have been made and the reasons for those changes. This can be helpful when you are working on a project and need to understand how it has evolved <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Finding the source of a bug</strong>: If you are trying to track down the source of a bug in a repository, you can use <strong class="source-inline">git log</strong> to view the commit history of the affected files and see which commit introduced <span class="No-Break">the bug.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Debugging issues</strong>: If you are trying to troubleshoot an issue in a repository, you can use <strong class="source-inline">git log</strong> to view the history of the affected files and see what changes might have caused <span class="No-Break">the issue.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a variety of options with <strong class="source-inline">git log</strong> to customize its output and filter commits that are displayed. For example, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">--author</strong> option to display only commits made by a specific person or the <strong class="source-inline">--since</strong> option to display only commits made in the <span class="No-Break">last month.</span></p>
<p>Here are some examples of using the <strong class="source-inline">git </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">log</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> command.</span></p>
<p>To display the commit history for the current repository, invoke a <strong class="source-inline">git </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">log</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> command:</span></p>

    Initial commit</pre>
<p>You can check the commit history for a specific file by running the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git log path/to/file</pre>
<p>With this command, you can display the commit history for a <span class="No-Break">specific branch:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git log branch-name</pre>
<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> will display the commit history for the specified branch, showing only the commits that were made on <span class="No-Break">that branch.</span></p>
<p>You can display the commit history for a range of commits with <span class="No-Break">this command:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git log hash1..hash2</pre>
<p>This will display the commit history for a range of commits between the <strong class="source-inline">hash1</strong> commit ID and the <strong class="source-inline">hash2</strong> commit ID, showing only the commits that occurred in <span class="No-Break">that range.</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git log --oneline</strong> will display the commit history in a compact format, showing only the commit hash and a message for <span class="No-Break">each commit:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git log --oneline</pre>
<p>With this command, you can display the commit history <span class="No-Break">with diffs:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git log -p</pre>
<p>This will <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>display the commit history, along with the diffs for each commit, showing the changes that were made in <span class="No-Break">each commit.</span></p>
<p>These are just a few examples of how you can use the <strong class="source-inline">git log</strong> command. You can find more information about the available options in the <span class="No-Break">Git documentation.</span></p>
<p>In the next section, we are going to look into shortening our Git history before merging our changes back to the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> branch. This is useful if we have a very long commit history in our local <span class="No-Break">development branch.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Branching</h2>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git branch</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">git switch</strong> are two commands that are used to manage branches <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>in a <span class="No-Break">Git repository.</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git branch</strong> is a command that is used to create, list, or delete branches in a repository. You can use it to create a new branch by specifying the name of the branch as an argument, <span class="No-Break">like so:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git branch new-branch</pre>
<p>This will create a new branch called <strong class="source-inline">new-branch</strong> that is based on the <span class="No-Break">current branch.</span></p>
<p>You can use the <strong class="source-inline">git branch</strong> command with the <strong class="source-inline">-a</strong> option to list all branches in the repository, including both local branches and <span class="No-Break">remote-tracking branches:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git branch -a</pre>
<p>You can use the <strong class="source-inline">git branch</strong> command with the <strong class="source-inline">-d</strong> option to delete a branch, as in the <span class="No-Break">following example:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git branch -d old-branch</pre>
<p>This will delete the <strong class="source-inline">old branch</strong> but only if it has been already fully merged into the upstream branch. If you wish to remove this branch, you can add a <strong class="source-inline">--force</strong> option or use the <strong class="source-inline">-D</strong> option, which is an alias to the <strong class="source-inline">--delete --force</strong> <span class="No-Break">Git branch.</span></p>
<p>Finally, to remove a remote branch, we will need to use the <strong class="source-inline">git push</strong> <span class="No-Break">command instead:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git push origin --delete old-branch</pre>
<p>This is a<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> destructive command and can’t be undone, so you should act with caution when <span class="No-Break">using it.</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">git switch</strong> is a command that is used to switch between branches in a repository. You can use it to switch to a different branch by specifying the name of the branch as an argument, <span class="No-Break">like so:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git switch new-branch</pre>
<p>This will switch to the <strong class="source-inline">new-branch</strong> branch and make it the <span class="No-Break">current branch.</span></p>
<p>Both <strong class="source-inline">git branch</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">git switch</strong> commands allow you to create new branches, list available branches, and switch between branches as needed. In the next section, we are going to introduce ways of working with Git, called workflo<a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>ws: <strong class="source-inline">git workflow</strong> and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">github workflow</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>Squashing commits using an interactive rebase</h2>
<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>squash commits using <strong class="source-inline">git rebase</strong>, you first need to determine the range of commits that you want to squash. This is typically done by specifying the commit hash of the first commit in the range and the commit hash of the last commit in the range. For example, if you want to squash the last three commits in your repository, you could use the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git rebase -i HEAD~3</pre>
<p>This will open an editor window showing a list of the last three commits, along with some instructions. Each commit is represented by a line in the file, and the line begins with the word <strong class="source-inline">pick</strong>. To squash a commit, you need to change the word <strong class="source-inline">pick</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">squash</strong> <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">s</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Here is an example of what the file might <span class="No-Break">look like:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
pick abc123 Add feature X
pick def456 Fix bug in feature X
pick ghi789 Add test for feature X</pre>
<p>To squash the second and third commits into the first commit, you would change the file to look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
pick abc123 Add feature X
squash def456 Fix bug in feature X
squash ghi789 Add test for feature X</pre>
<p>After <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>making the changes, you can save and close the file. Git will then apply the changes and present you with another editor window, where you can enter a new commit message for the <span class="No-Break">combined commit.</span></p>
<p>It is important to note that squashing commits using <strong class="source-inline">git rebase</strong> can be a destructive operation, as it permanently alters the commit history of the repository. It is generally recommended to use <strong class="source-inline">git rebase</strong> with caution and to make sure that you have a backup of your repository before <span class="No-Break">using it.</span></p>
<p>If you want to undo changes made by a <strong class="source-inline">git rebase</strong> operation, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">git rebase --abort</strong> command to discard the changes and restore the repository to its <span class="No-Break">previous state.</span></p>
<p>After successfully squashing commits, you will be able to push it back to a remote repository, but only by using the <strong class="source-inline">git push --force</strong> command, which will ignore the fact that you just rewrote a commit history of this branch. This is a destructive operation and can’t be undone, so again, please double- and triple-check before pushing changes with the <strong class="source-inline">--</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">force</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> option.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>Solving Git conflicts</h2>
<p>Conflicts <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>can occur when you are trying to merge or rebase branches that have conflicting changes. This can happen when the same lines of code have been modified in both branches, and Git is unable to automatically resolve <span class="No-Break">the conflicts.</span></p>
<p>When a conflict occurs during a merge or rebase, Git will mark the conflicting lines in the affected files, and you will need to manually resolve the conflicts before you <span class="No-Break">can continue.</span></p>
<p>Here is an example of how you might resolve a conflict during <span class="No-Break">a merge.</span></p>
<p>Run <strong class="source-inline">git merge</strong> to merge the <span class="No-Break">two branches:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git merge branch-to-merge</pre>
<p>Git will <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>detect any conflicts and mark the affected lines in the affected files. The conflicting lines will be surrounded by <strong class="source-inline">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">=======</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <span class="No-Break">markers:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
something = 'this is in our HEAD';
=======
something = 'this is in our branch-to-merge';
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-to-merge</pre>
<p>Open the affected files and resolve the conflicts by choosing which version of the code you want to keep. You can keep either the version from the current branch (<strong class="source-inline">HEAD</strong>) or the version from the branch that you are <span class="No-Break">merging (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">branch-to-merge</strong></span><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
something = 'this is in our branch-to-merge';</pre>
<p>Stage the resolved files using <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">git add</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git add path/to/file</pre>
<p>Continue the merge or rebase by running <strong class="source-inline">git rebase --continue</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">git </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">merge --continue</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
admin@myhome:~/git-repository$ git merge --continue</pre>
<p>Resolving conflicts during a merge or rebase can be a tedious process, but it is an important part of working with Git. By carefully reviewing conflicting changes and choosing the correct version of the code, you can ensure that your repository remains consistent and free <span class="No-Break">of errors.</span></p>
<p>It is also a good idea to regularly synchronize your local copy of the repository with the source branch before merging or rebasing, in case you encounter conflicts or other issues that you are unable to resolve. This can help you recover from any mistakes or accidents<a id="_idIndexMarker599"/> that might occur during <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></p>
<p>There are also amazing graphical tools to solve conflicts in a bit more interactive manner. If you’re using an <strong class="bold">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>), you can use a built-in interface instead of using an external tool. Sometimes, it might not be enough, and you will need a dedicated application just for resolving conflicts, such as <strong class="source-inline">KDiff3</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">WinMerge</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Meld</strong>, or one of the other options <span class="No-Break">out there.</span></p>
<p>In this section, we have explained branches, repositories, local and remote repositories, merging, and rebasing. Next, we will look into browsing your reposit<a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>ory’s historical changes and <span class="No-Break">modifying it.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-130">GitFlow and GitHub Flow</h1>
<p><strong class="bold">GitFlow</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen. It aims to provide a consistent and easy-to-use branching model for teams working on software projects. The GitFlow model uses two main branches: <strong class="source-inline">develop</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">master</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">develop </strong>branch is used to develop new features, while the <strong class="source-inline">master</strong> branch represents the current production-ready state of the code base. There are also several supporting branches, such as <strong class="source-inline">feature</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">release</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">hotfix</strong>, which are used to manage the process of developing, releasing, and <span class="No-Break">maintaining software.</span></p>
<p><strong class="bold">GitHub Flow</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> model that was developed by and for GitHub for use with its hosting and collaboration platform. It is similar to GitFlow, but it is designed to be simpler and easier to use, especially for smaller teams and projects. In the GitHub Flow model, all development is done in branches, and new features are merged into the <strong class="source-inline">master</strong> branch using pull requests. There is no separate <strong class="source-inline">develop</strong> branch, and the <strong class="source-inline">master</strong> branch is always considered to be the current production-ready version of the <span class="No-Break">code base.</span></p>
<p>Another branching model that is <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>very similar is <strong class="bold">GitLab Flow</strong>. It’s used to manage the development and maintenance of software projects, and it is specifically designed to be used with GitLab, a web-based Git repository manager that provides <strong class="bold">source code management</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCM</strong>), <strong class="bold">continuous integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>), <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>GitLab Flow model, all development is done in branches, and new features are merged into the <strong class="source-inline">master</strong> branch using merge requests. There is no separate <strong class="source-inline">develop</strong> branch, and the <strong class="source-inline">master</strong> branch is always considered to be the current production-ready version of the code base. However, GitLab Flow does include some additional features and tools, such as the ability to use protected branches and merge request approvals, which can help teams enforce development best practices and maintain a high level of <span class="No-Break">code quality.</span></p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll look into configuring Git to our needs using <span class="No-Break">configuration files.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Global git configuration – .gitconfig</h2>
<p>The <strong class="source-inline">.gitconfig</strong> file is a<a id="_idIndexMarker604"/> configuration file that is used to set global options for Git. It is typically located in the user’s <strong class="source-inline">home</strong> directory and can be edited using any <span class="No-Break">text editor.</span></p>
<p>Some common options that you may want to include in your <strong class="source-inline">.gitconfig</strong> are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="source-inline">user.name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">user.email</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>options specify the<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> name and email address that will be associated with your Git commits. It is important to set these options correctly, as they will be used to identify you as the author of <span class="No-Break">the commits.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">color.ui</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>option enables or disables colored output in Git. You can set this option to <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> to enable colored output when Git is run in a terminal that supports it or to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> to always enable or disable colored <span class="No-Break">output, respectively.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">core.editor</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> option specifies the text editor that Git will use when it needs you to enter a commit message or other input. You can set this option to the command for your preferred text editor, such as <strong class="source-inline">nano</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">vi</strong>, <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">emacs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">merge.tool</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> option specifies the tool that Git will use to resolve conflicts when merging branches. You can set this option to the command for a visual merge tool, such as <strong class="source-inline">kdiff3</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">meld</strong>, <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">tkdiff</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">push.default</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker610"/> option specifies the behavior of the <strong class="source-inline">git push</strong> command when you do not specify a branch. You can set this option to <strong class="source-inline">simple</strong>, which pushes the current branch to the same name on the remote, or upstream, branch, which pushes the current branch to the remote branch that it <span class="No-Break">is tracking.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">alias.*</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>options allow you to create aliases for Git commands. For example, you could set <strong class="source-inline">alias.st</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">status</strong>, which would allow you to use the <strong class="source-inline">git st</strong> command instead of <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">git status</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The following is an<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> example <strong class="source-inline">.gitconfig</strong> file making use of the preceding options, with some comments after <span class="No-Break">every section:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
[user]
name = Jane Doe
email = jane@doe.example
[color]
    ui = always</pre>
<p>The <strong class="source-inline">user</strong> section defines the user and email that will be used as the author for every commit. The <strong class="source-inline">color</strong> section enables colors for readability purposes. <strong class="source-inline">ui = always</strong> will enable colors always for all output types (machine consumption intended or not). Other possible options are <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">never</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>The <strong class="source-inline">alias</strong> section lets you simplify some long commands while working with Git. It will create an alias defined on the left-hand side for a Git command, which you can add after the <span class="No-Break">equals sign.</span></p>
<p>Here’s <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
[alias]
  ci = commit</pre>
<p>We’re defining the <strong class="source-inline">ci</strong> command as <strong class="source-inline">commit</strong>. After adding this to your <strong class="source-inline">.gitconfig</strong> file in your home directory, you will get another Git command: <strong class="source-inline">git ci</strong>, which will effectively run the <strong class="source-inline">git commit</strong> command. You can add aliases for all common Git commands you use daily. The following command is telling Git where to find a default <strong class="source-inline">.</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">gitignore</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
[core]
    excludesfile = ~/.gitignore</pre>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>following <strong class="source-inline">push</strong> setting is changing the default push behavior, which will require you to specify to which remote branch you’re going to push your <span class="No-Break">local branch:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
[push]
  default = current</pre>
<p>By specifying the <strong class="source-inline">current</strong> option, we instruct Git to try to push the local branch to a remote branch with exactly the same name as the local branch. Other options are set <span class="No-Break">out here:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="source-inline">nothing</strong>: Don’t try to <span class="No-Break">push anything.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">matching</strong>: Consider all branches remote and local with the same name to be a match and push <span class="No-Break">all matches.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">upstream</strong>: Push the current branch to an <span class="No-Break">upstream branch.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">simple</strong>: This is the default option. It will refuse to push to the upstream if the name of the local branch differs from the name of the remote <span class="No-Break">upstream branch.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>When running the <strong class="source-inline">git pull</strong> command, Git will try to integrate remote commits into your local branch. By default, it will try to merge upstream, which will result in possibly unwanted merge commits. This will change the default behavior <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">rebase</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
[pull]
rebase = false</pre>
<p>See the <em class="italic">Local versus remote Git repositories</em> section for <span class="No-Break">more information.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Ignoring some files using a .gitignore configuration file</h2>
<p>A <strong class="source-inline">.gitignore</strong> file is a<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> configuration file that is used to tell Git which files or directories to ignore when tracking changes in a repository. This can be useful if you have files that are generated by your build process, are specific to your local environment, or are otherwise not relevant to the project and do not need to be tracked <span class="No-Break">by Git.</span></p>
<p>Here are some examples of the types of files and directories that you might include in your <strong class="source-inline">.</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">gitignore</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Temporary files</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker615"/> are created by your editor or operating system and are not necessary for the project. Examples might include <strong class="source-inline">*.tmp</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">*.bak</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">*.</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">swp</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> files.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Build artifacts</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker616"/> are files that are generated by your build process and are not necessary for the project. Examples might include <strong class="source-inline">*.exe</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">*.jar</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">*.war</strong> files and <strong class="source-inline">bin/</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">obj/</strong>, or <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">dist/</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> directories.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Dependencies</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker617"/> are directories that contain dependencies from your package manager that you don’t want to include in the Git repository. For example, you might want to ignore the <strong class="source-inline">node_modules/</strong> directory if you are using <strong class="source-inline">npm</strong>, or the <strong class="source-inline">vendor/</strong> directory if you are <span class="No-Break">using Composer.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">IDE-specific files</strong>: The<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> IDE creates some cache and configuration directories in the same directory as you have your local copy of the Git repository. You might want to ignore files that are specific to that IDE—for example, the <strong class="source-inline">idea/</strong> directory if you are using JetBrains IDEs, or the <strong class="source-inline">.vscode/</strong> directory if you are using Visual <span class="No-Break">Studio Code.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Sensitive information</strong>: Files <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>containing passwords or API keys. We strongly advise taking special care to ignore those files to prevent them from being committed to the repository. This will save you a lot of headaches and unnecessary risk. These days, bots such as GitHub’s <em class="italic">Dependabot</em> will raise an alert (or even block the commit) if some of those sensitive files get into your repositories, but it’s better to catch these earlier in the <span class="No-Break">development process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Here<a id="_idIndexMarker620"/> is an example <strong class="source-inline">.gitignore</strong> file that ignores some common types <span class="No-Break">of files:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
# Temporary files or logs
*.tmp
*.bak
*.swp
*.log
# Build artifacts
bin/
obj/
dist/
venv/
*.jar
*.war
*.exe
# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/
requirements.txt
# IDE-specific files
.idea/
.vscode/
# Sensitive information
secrets.txt
api_keys.json</pre>
<p>It’s also possible to use wildcards<a id="_idIndexMarker621"/> and <strong class="bold">regular expressions</strong> (<strong class="bold">regexes</strong>) to specify patterns <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>of files to ignore. You can also put <strong class="source-inline">.gitignore</strong> files inside directories where you need a special rule that it is not desired to be <span class="No-Break">there globally.</span></p>
<p>Finally, you can put your site-wide <strong class="source-inline">.gitignore</strong> file inside your home directory to make s<a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>ure you won’t commit any files needed for your <span class="No-Break">local development.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-133">Summary</h1>
<p>Git is such a powerful tool that it’s hard to fit all its features into a single book. In this chapter, we’ve learned the most basic tasks you will need to know in your day-to-day work as a DevOps engineer, and you are well equipped to handle most of the issues you <span class="No-Break">will encounter.</span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will focus on Docker and containerization, where we will put all the skills you’ve gained so far to <span class="No-Break">the test.</span></p>
