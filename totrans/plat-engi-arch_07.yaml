    posture, the platform needs to conform to best practices, but it cannot take on
    the responsibility of the application.</st> <st c="4896">In other words, the platform
    needs to provide all the scaffolding to the dev team and the stakeholders to support
    a secure and compliant product.</st> <st c="5042">For example, if the Python language

    it very briefly due to its importance for platform security.</st> <st c="50327">GitOps
    is loosely defined as an automated process that validates the SOT (Git or other
    version control), which defines the desired state and the actual state match.</st>
    <st c="50492">It does this through one-time deployments or changes but also through
    an automated reconcile loop that actively checks for changes in the desired state
    and acts upon the actual state to make it match, or detects a change in the actual
    state and makes changes on the system to put it back to the desired state.</st>
    <st c="50802">The current largest open source GitOps project is Argo CD, a CD
    tool that is a property of CNCF.</st> <st c="50899">Within Argo CD and other GitOps

  id: totrans-251
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: <st c="51024">For GitOps, there are two models of propagating changes; one is
    a push model and the other is a pull model.</st> <st c="51133">In a push model,
    the GitOps system receives changes as pushes to its API endpoint.</st> <st c="51216">It
    goes without saying that those pushes should be properly authenticated, but we’ll
    say it anyway to ensure there’s no confusion.</st> <st c="51347">After receiving
    the push, the GitOps system processes the changes and then takes action.</st>
    <st c="51436">That action is probably promoting new software packages to production,
    but it could also be configuration changes.</st> <st c="51551">However, the source
    of the push is not typically validated with this model, and Argo CD doesn’t have
    a configuration to validate it.</st> <st c="51684">This creates an attack vector
    because if the credentials are compromised, a bad actor can push changes through
    the CD system, which can open up additional</st> <st c="51839">entry points.</st>

    system reaches out to the SOT using its authentication and then reads the changes
    in from the endpoint.</st> <st c="52004">Since the source is a known safe source,
    the application of those changes via automation is considered a safe action.</st>
    <st c="52122">This is not to say a pull model isn’t without risks.</st> <st c="52175">Both
    push and pull models can be subjected to MITM attacks, but in a properly secured
