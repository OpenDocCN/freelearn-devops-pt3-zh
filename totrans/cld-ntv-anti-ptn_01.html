<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">What are the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker105"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1"> advantages of defining our cloud resources via IaC? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.2">Whenever we deploy something repeatedly, such as a temporary or new testing environment, the architecture and deployment approach will always be consistent, and the approach is easy to repeat. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.3">Typically, we use different parameters for a different environment, for example, a different IP range for a different network segment or a smaller auto-scaling group for non-production environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.4">The rest of the code stays the same. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.5">Hence, IaC is also very efficient in achieving scalability or implementing global deployments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.6">Configuration and code are fully version-controlled in Git. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.7">Therefore, it is easy to go back to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">previous version.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">We can also easily use version pinning if we want our production environment to be further behind than the development environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.2">IaC also helps to achieve a good DR response time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.3">Instead of manually or semi-manually building a new DR environment, we can fully automate this with IaC and CI/CD technologies, which we will cover in a minute. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.4">IaC also helps to meet security and compliance requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.5">Security requirements are embedded in the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.6">For instance, if we only want to allow HTTPS traffic, our code will only open port </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">443</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">, then we articulate that in the source code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.2">As best practice, the code will be peer-reviewed to ensure we meet our requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.3">When we redeploy, we can be sure we don’t expose our application since the deployment will deliver a repeatable outcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.4">All changes are tracked in Git, which helps with auditing and compliance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.5">Some regulatory frameworks require a repeatable approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.6">That is exactly what IaC establishes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.7">There is also a cost benefit to IaC. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.8">Because creating and destroying resources is so easy, it helps avoid over-provisioning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.9">If test environments are not needed, then resources can be easily shut down if they are not required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.10">If we take a complete serverless approach, we will need to worry less about this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.11">We will talk about this later when we get into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">the strategy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">How do we deploy the cloud resources that we have defined via IaC? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.2">How do we build and deploy our application code? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.3">How do we execute all the functional and non-functional tests in an automated way? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.4">The answer is CI/CD, and we will explore </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">it now.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">CI/CD</span><a id="_idIndexMarker106"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1"> is a combination of continuous integration and continuous delivery, sometimes referred to as continuous deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.2">The main difference is that continuous delivery requires a manual approval step, whereas continuous deployment deploys automatically after a code change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.3">CI/CD bridges gaps between development and operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.4">It enforces automation during the build process, functional and non-functional testing, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">and deployment.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1">The process starts with the developer using the preferred </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1">integrated development environment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1">IDE</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.2">Sometimes, developers use just a command-line tool. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.3">However, IDEs are commonly </span><a id="_idIndexMarker108"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">used because they provide practical built-in features and plugin architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.2">This architecture enables the installation of extensions or plugins. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.3">Visual Studio Code is a popular open source IDE developed by Microsoft. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.4">Even though the software is open source, the available extensions are not necessarily open source. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.5">IDEs usually have a built-in Git integration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.6">However, we can install an additional extension that visualizes the Git repository and the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">Git branches.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">Git branching and shift left</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1">A Git branch</span><a id="_idIndexMarker109"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.1"> is a separate version of the code repository created for a new change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.2">There are different branching models, such as trunk-based development or feature branching. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.3">We will look into that in more detail in </span><a href="B22364_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor136"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.1">Chapter 5</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.1">, and for our example, we will use the feature branching model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.2">When the developer wants to commit a change to the repository, it is important to work off the latest version in the repo (short for repository). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.3">Therefore, a </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.1">git pull</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.1"> command</span><a id="_idIndexMarker110"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.1"> is required to ensure the latest version is in the local copy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.2">After that, the developer creates a new feature branch and updates the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.3">There are a lot of checks that can now be run automatically to provide early feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.4">For example, a security extension could scan the code and identify weaknesses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.5">For instance, if the code is a Terraform template that defines a public Amazon S3 bucket, then the plugin can provide feedback that the bucket should be private. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.6">S3 buckets are blob storage constructs in AWS, and misconfigured S3 buckets have been the reason for many data breaches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.7">This early feedback is an example of shift left, and the developer can fix the code before it is validated in the CI/CD pipeline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.8">Code formatting, linting, and syntax validations typically run on the client side. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.9">Once the developer is happy with the changes, the code is committed to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.1">Git repo.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.1">Optionally, a commit can trigger a pre-commit hook, executing the steps we just described. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.2">It can also </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.1">auto-generate documentation.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.1">Approval and deployment</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.585.1">The developer then raises a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.1">pull request</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1">PR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.2">Someone performs a peer review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.3">The PR gets approved if the code meets the expectations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.4">Then, the code is merged into the main branch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.5">The merge will</span><a id="_idIndexMarker111"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1"> trigger the pipeline to run. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.2">In the beginning, there will be some validation steps similar to the ones the developer had already run. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.3">Still, we want to ensure that some validations are mandatory and don’t rely on individuals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.4">As a next step, the build process will kick off and run some static code analysis, functional and non-functional tests, and further security scans. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.5">Once the pipeline run is successful, an authorized individual can trigger the deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.6">These steps are a simple example of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">CI/CD pipeline.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">We can see the many benefits of automating those steps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.2">Building out the required pipelines for an organization will take a while, but once they are established, the development process becomes much quicker, more reliable, and more secure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.3">But how can we validate that it also runs as expected? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.4">Let’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">find out.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">We have already covered many </span><a id="_idIndexMarker112"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">aspects of cloud native solutions, including the cultural impact, cross-functional teams, DevSecOps culture, and tooling complexity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.2">We will now examine observability and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker113"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">resilience, two areas that need more consideration during the early design phases of cloud </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1">native solutions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">If we do not establish comprehensive observability, we will not know whether we achieve our targets, such as response times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.2">And if we fail, we will not know where the bottleneck is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.3">Therefore we need to have a holistic logging, monitoring, and observability strategy in place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.4">The same applies to withstanding failures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.5">We need insights to validate that our deployment architecture matches the resilience expectations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.6">We will explore both aspects, starting with observability and what it means in a cloud native context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.7">We cannot fix what we cannot see. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.8">Observability helps get actionable insight into an application’s internal state and measure it by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">evaluating outputs.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1">Logging – the observability enabler</span></h2>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1">Logs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.1"> are the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker114"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.1">key enabler for monitoring and observability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.2">The scope of logs is very broad, and they can include operating system logs, access logs, application logs, infrastructure logs, network flow </span><a id="_idIndexMarker115"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1">logs, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.1">domain name service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">DNS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1">) logs, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.2">Logs enable monitoring, alerting, debugging, incident discovery, and performance optimization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.3">Earlier in this chapter, we clarified that a typical DevSecOps team (aka product squad) writes the code and also manages their application, also referred to as “product.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.4">Therefore, the team will be motivated to establish good observability practices </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">and tooling.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.1">A good maturity level can be achieved when the team has a good mix of skills and experience mix across development and operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.2">Individuals with operational experience know the value of observability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.3">People with a software engineering background also see the value of observability, especially on the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.1">application layer.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.1">However, sometimes, the other layers, such as the network or operating system layer, need to be considered more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.2">Getting a holistic picture covering all layers is critical to getting good insights into our systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.3">It is also essential to be able to correlate data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.4">For instance, if we have a hybrid cloud application, a business transaction might start at the CDN, get to an API layer, and then write to a cloud-hosted queue where the on-premises business logic pulls the data from and writes it to an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.1">on-premises-hosted database.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.1">Consistency, standardization, and good quality of log</span><a id="_idIndexMarker117"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.1"> information are foundational for helpful dashboards and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.627.1">meaningful alerts.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.1">A couple of things need to be considered to achieve this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.2">We will need an agreement on the severity levels we want to log. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.3">Not all severity levels require logging all the time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.4">The debug level, for instance, should only be logged when we are debugging. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.5">If we don’t make a sensible decision about when to use what severity level and what levels need to be logged, we will have inconsistent log files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.6">It is also very likely that we will then log too much. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.7">This means we need a bigger log file indexer, increasing operational expenses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.8">An increasing size of log volume makes it harder to find relevant information in case of an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.9">That is especially the case if we don’t have a standardized </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1">log structure.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">Therefore, we also need to define what information is captured in the log files and the sequence and structure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.2">Structured data formats such as JSON help achieve this, and they help include key-value pairs to provide context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.3">The log entry could include a key of </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">userID</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1"> or </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.1">sessionID</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.1"> and the actual ID as a value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.2">The log entry should contain other helpful contexts during troubleshooting, such as timestamps, transaction IDs, and correlation IDs, to trace and correlate requests between microservices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.3">We should not store sensitive information such as credit card details, customer names, and addresses in log files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.4">Some regulatory frameworks, such as the PCI-DSS, mandate data categories that must not be stored in log files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.5">Centralized logging will also help to find data correlations because logs from APIs, the database, and infrastructure events will be saved in the same storage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.6">Examples of popular open source logging tools are Logback, Graylog, and Log4j. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.7">The latter became famous in 2021 due to a vulnerability known as Log4 Shell, which allowed hackers to take control of devices running unpatched versions of Log4j. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.8">Therefore, we should always protect ourselves from vulnerabilities, and we will discuss this in more detail in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">Chapter 6</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.2">Some service mesh solutions, such as Istio or Linkerd, provide logs, metrics, and traces out of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1">the box.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">Addressing resilience</span><a id="_idIndexMarker124"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1"> in a cloud native architecture is crucial to understanding how the application can withstand failures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.2">Failures can occur on any layer in the architecture and in any of the components involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.3">AWS released the first version of the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1">AWS Well-Architected Framework</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1">, Microsoft followed with an Azure version in 2020, and Google released the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">Google Cloud Architecture Framework</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1"> in 2021. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.2">All three frameworks have a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">Reliability</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1"> pillar or chapter in their framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.2">Nevertheless, this area is often misunderstood, especially in the early days of a cloud adoption journey. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.3">It is the architect’s and engineer’s responsibility to design and implement the application in a way that addresses possible failures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.4">If we leverage managed services, then the CSP will take a lot of considerations into account, and we can reduce the reliability surface that we need to manage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.5">We will discuss this in detail in </span><a href="B22364_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor198"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1">Chapter 7</span></em></span></a><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1">.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1">Humans can fail – so can the cloud</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">Even though the CSP is responsible for the resilience of the cloud services, outages can and will occur. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.2">“</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">Everything fails, all the time</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.669.1">” is a famous quote from Amazon’s chief technology officer, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.1">Werner Vogels.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.1">There are a variety of infrastructure failure scenarios on the CSP side, such as service outages, AZ outages, region outages, or global services outages, such as a DNS outage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.2">These are just some examples, and, of course, we can also have outages within the actual application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.3">Examples are misconfiguration of load balancing or database connection pools, running out of disk or storage space, not allocating enough compute power such as memory or CPU size, unexpected configuration drift, or software vulnerabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.4">We need to consider guiding principles when architecting resilience, and we will step through </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.1">these now.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.1">Automating recovery</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1">First, an application should automatically </span><a id="_idIndexMarker125"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1">recover from failure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.2">This behavior is also known as self-healing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.3">A failure needs to be discovered to initiate an automated recovery process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.4">We put health checks in place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.5">Those health checks can trigger follow-up actions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.6">For example, we can configure health checks on a load balancer, and if a container instance behind the load balancer fails, it will be automatically replaced with a new instance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.7">For this recovery scenario, it is essential to have a quick start-up time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.8">Therefore, lean container images such as Docker Alpine are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">widely used.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">Another guiding principle is that all change must be managed through code and automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.2">Automation enables a repeatable outcome and allows all changes to be tracked and reviewed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.3">CI/CD becomes one of our best friends when we move into a cloud native world. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.4">Write access should be limited to CI/CD pipelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.5">Developers should be limited to read-only access for all environments except for sandbox environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.6">If human access is required in an incident, then there should be a break-glass mechanism. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.7">That means the elevated permissions are limited to the required timeframe and audit logs capture all manually </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">performed changes.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1">Resilience and scalability</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1">Recovery procedures must be </span><a id="_idIndexMarker126"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1">tested. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.2">A working backup routine does not guarantee backup integrity or that the recovery procedure will work as planned. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.3">Our business continuity plan needs to address recovery testing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.4">We must validate the documentation during a recovery test and update the documented recovery steps if required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.5">A data criticality framework will help to define the proper </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1">recovery time objectives</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.1">RTOs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.685.1">) and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.1">recovery point objectives</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.1">RPOs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.2">The RTO defines the maximum</span><a id="_idIndexMarker127"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.1"> time to restore a failed application after an outage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.2">The RPO </span><a id="_idIndexMarker128"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1">defines the maximum time we tolerate for a data loss. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.2">For instance, if the RPO is 1 minute, we accept the risk that we could lose data for 60 seconds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.3">Therefore, we will need to configure automated backups for every minute. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.4">The shorter the RTO is, the more frequently we need to perform backups. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.5">We need to consider cost and performance trade-offs to make informed decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.6">We must test other recovery scenarios, such as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1">network recovery.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1">Another resilience guiding principle is that an application should scale horizontally to increase availability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.2">Horizontal scaling means we scale out in the event of a traffic spike. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.3">Typically, additional instances are spun up behind a load balancer to distribute the load. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.4">If we architect the solution for</span><a id="_idIndexMarker129"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.1"> auto-scaling, capacity guesses become somewhat irrelevant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.2">We still need to consider hard service limits published by the cloud vendors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.3">But with dynamic provisioning and auto-scaling, we rely less on capacity estimates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.4">Auto-scaling also helps reduce the CSP cost since we can right-size based on dynamic demand changes instead of statically provisioning for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.1">peak times.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.1">Testing the recovery</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.1">Game days are an excellent way to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker130"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.1">validate resilience and uncover weaknesses that require remediation to improve application reliability or security posture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.2">These are structured events where teams simulate different failure scenarios to test the auto-recovery, the efficiency of human processes, and the accuracy of the recovery documentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.3">The goals of the game day need to be defined before we can select failure scenarios. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.4">We will also need an environment where we can simulate outages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.5">If our applications, including infrastructure, are defined as code and can be deployed via CI/CD pipelines, creating a temporary environment for that purpose will be easy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.6">The game days usually start with a team briefing before the incident simulation commences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.7">Typical scenarios include shutting down servers or containers, throttling network bandwidth, or simulating cloud </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.1">service outages.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.1">We can simulate outages with fault injection simulators. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.2">Netflix developed tools for this purpose and released Chaos Monkey in 2011. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.3">It randomly terminates instances. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.4">Other tools followed, including Latency Monkey, to simulate network latencies or unreliable network conditions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.5">Nowadays, the major cloud platforms offer cloud native fault simulators: AWS Fault Injection Service, Azure Chaos Studio, and Google Cloud </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.1">Chaos Engineering.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.1">Once the fault injection has started, the team members need to detect where the problem is by using the observability tools and diagnosing findings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.2">Data recovery needs to be validated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.3">The validation includes data integrity validation and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.1">performance testing.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.1">The insights gained will lead to mitigation steps, such as improving data recovery or fixing a misconfigured auto-scaling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.2">The day ends with analyzing what worked well and what did not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.3">These required improvements need to be implemented and tested again at a later stage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.4">Game days are a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.1"> good way of embedding feedback loops in our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.1">DevSecOps culture.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.773.1">The cloud platform team typically provides a service catalog that contains self-service artifacts, such as containers, network constructs for routing, guardrails, observability tooling, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.773.2">Some artifacts will be provisioned as part of the automated account creation, including networking constructs, logging and monitoring capabilities, and guardrails. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.773.3">The product teams might publish other items to the service catalog or the container registry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.773.4">In this case, we have a three-tiered shared responsibility model: the CSP, the cloud platform team, and the product teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.773.5">This can result in confusion around the operating model, which we will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.774.1">discuss next.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.1">Operating model confusions</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.776.1">The operating model</span><a id="_idIndexMarker139"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.777.1"> needs to address the responsibility model, and a clearly defined RACI matrix will help everyone understand what to do (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.778.1">RACI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.1"> stands for </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.1">responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.2">The RACI matrix </span><a id="_idIndexMarker140"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.1">should include all phases in the SDLC, from source code to operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.2">Some example tasks that should be in the RACI matrix are certificate management, DNS management, key management, backup, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.783.1">and recovery.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.1">When I worked for a cloud and DevOps consultancy, I started a new engagement with an educational institution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.2">It was my first morning on site when an administrator accidentally deleted an entire data warehouse environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.3">Unfortunately, this was the only non-production environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.4">The data warehouse is a very business-critical application since it manages all the data of university applicants and students. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.5">We then tried to recover from backups. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.6">Unfortunately, the data recovery had never been tested. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.7">The backup data was corrupt and, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.1">therefore, useless.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.1">Another administrator then asked whether we could call Amazon and ask them for backups. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.2">This question demonstrates that the shared responsibility model is not always understood. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.3">The administrator should not have had permission to delete an environment in the first place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.4">Access and identity management, including the principle of least privilege enforcement, is the customer’s responsibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.5">Also, data management, including backups and recovery testing, is the responsibility of the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.6">After that incident, we built a self-healing solution for the client and improved the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.1">permission model.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.788.1">Missing out on cultural transformation</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.1">Another common </span><a id="_idIndexMarker141"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.1">misunderstanding is that cloud native is only about technology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.2">We have talked about the DevSecOps culture before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.3">The full potential will only be utilized if we are changing the culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.4">Otherwise, business innovation will be limited. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.5">It is easy to experiment in the cloud, create new proofs of concept, tear them down, or change them, but only with a DevSecOps mindset when mature automation practices are established. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.6">We need to put an effort into cultural transformation and leverage training and team augmentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.7">Otherwise, the resistance to change will continue, and the opportunity for quick change and release cycles can never </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.791.1">be unleashed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.1">The lack of DevSecOps maturity will result in poor governance, limited agility, and slow responsiveness to market needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.2">A siloed approach where development and operations are separated will be reflected in the application structure as described in Conway’s Law. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.3">Eventually, the end customer experience will not be as good as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.4">Another consideration is that cost management and ownership differ from an on-premises CapEx model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.5">We are shifting</span><a id="_idIndexMarker142"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.793.1"> toward </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.794.1">operational expenses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.1">OpEx</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.797.1">), and without cost ownership and cost tagging, we cannot achieve effective showback or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.1">chargeback models.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.1">If cloud native is solely seen as a technology enabler, we will not achieve efficient cost management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.2">There will also be security challenges, which brings us to the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.800.1">fundamental misunderstanding.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.801.1">Treating cloud like on-premises</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.802.1">Believing that</span><a id="_idIndexMarker143"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.803.1"> security controls in the cloud are the same as on-premises can also lead to many anti-patterns. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.803.2">This misbelief brings significant security risks and challenges and can dramatically reduce efficiencies and slow down our time </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.1">to market.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.1">We must manage data encryption, access controls, and backups for an on-premises environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.2">CSPs offer native security controls for encryption and access control. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.3">However, these controls need to be configured by the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.4">It is critical to understand the responsibility demarcation, and it shows why understanding the shared responsibility model is so important. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.5">In other words, we can establish data security controls much easier in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.6">Still, we must remember to look into our security and regulatory requirements and assess the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.806.1">attack vector.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.807.1">Because of the global nature of the cloud, it is also easy to copy data to different regions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.807.2">Cross-region support is a feature, but it can also be a trap with severe consequences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.807.3">Since it is straightforward to switch between areas, it is recommended to have a policy-as-code framework in place that prevents that from happening </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.808.1">by accident.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.1">To manage network security on-premises, we use firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection and prevention systems, which we must manage ourselves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.2">Cloud native offers virtual network segmentation and security features such as NACLs, security firewalls, and managed firewall services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.3">Those controls need to be configured by the customer, but this can be done much easier than on-premises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.4">We can guarantee consistent security controls between environments if those controls are managed via source code and deployed via CI/CD pipelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.5">This approach has similarities with application security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.6">For on-premises workloads, we need to build all the controls, including vulnerability management and application firewalls. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.7">If we utilize a fully managed service, such as a managed database service or FaaS, the CSP is already taking care of the majority. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.8">We still need secure coding practices and scan our code, but we don’t need to scan the managed runtime environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.9">The CSP manages that for us; they have comprehensive compliance coverage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.10">The coverage applies at least to the level managed by the CSP and we can download compliance reports for external audits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.11">The customer still needs to take care of the layer above, as described in the shared responsibility model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.12">However, cloud native provides compliance and audit features that can be configured for our needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.13">Cloud native services include Azure Compliance Manager, AWS Config, and Google Cloud Compliance </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.1">Resource Center.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.811.1">Lift &amp; shift will leverage the full cloud potential</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.1">Thinking that a lift and shift approach will leverage all cloud benefits is another widely spread misbelief. </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.813.1">Lift and shift</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.1"> means an application is moved from on-premises to the cloud without rearchitecting and refactoring. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.2">Lift and shift does not leverage any cloud native benefits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.3">Instead of leveraging a managed database service, the database will be built using VMs, which requires installing the operating system and database. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.4">That means we must patch the database server, scan it for vulnerabilities, and develop and manage the entire security from scratch instead of leveraging built-in features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.5">It would be much simpler if we could migrate our database to a managed database service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.6">That way, we can significantly reduce the operational complexity and simplify the security approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.7">Cloud native services also have built-in scalability, resilience, and observability features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.8">They simplify the application architecture and make it easier to operate the application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.9">A lift and shift approach is very costly; such an application’s operational cost can be higher than on-premises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.10">A driver for lift and shift could be a data center exit strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.11">The overall effort will be higher because we need to build all the security controls and building blocks traditionally and then refactor the application toward cloud native. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.12">The effort duplication brings many challenges and a high likelihood of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.815.1">budget blowout.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.816.1">Containers solve everything</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.817.1">“Moving everything onto containers will make my application cloud native” is another widespread misconception. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.817.2">A </span><a id="_idIndexMarker144"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.1">containerized application does not necessarily utilize all the cloud native features we have explored. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.2">There are several variations of this misunderstanding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.3">Another one is that cloud native requires containers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.4">Even though containers are a fundamental technology in this space, they are not necessarily required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.5">We might be able to use FaaS if that is a good architectural fit for our goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.6">In that case, we don’t need to manage containers or a cluster. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.7">A further variation of the container misunderstanding is that Kubernetes is required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.8">Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration platform, and the CSP offers managed Kubernetes services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.9">There are some excellent use cases for it, such as microservice architectures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.10">However, it comes with a steeper learning curve compared to Faas, and it is often underestimated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.11">It is also worthwhile checking whether the required skills are available in the geographical market where the team needs </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.819.1">to be.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.820.1">Security can be an afterthought</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.821.1">A very concerning </span><a id="_idIndexMarker145"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.822.1">misunderstanding is that security can be bolted on afterward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.822.2">Security must be considered and integrated from the beginning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.822.3">“</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.823.1">Security is job zero</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.1">” is a well-known quote first mentioned by AWS’s chief information security officer in 2017. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.2">It means that security is everyone’s responsibility and should be considered the foundational priority in all cloud and IT operations, even before other jobs or tasks, hence </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.825.1">job zero</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.2">In the DevSecOps section of this chapter, we discussed how security aspects need to be addressed early, ideally starting with security checks in the IDE, having scans embedded in the CI/CD pipeline, and continuing with scans in our environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.3">A lot of this end-to-end coverage will not be present if security gets retrofitted later on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.4">That means the application has an increased attack surface, and data breaches become more likely because of a lack of guardrails. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.5">There might be operational interruptions, maybe because a cloud native firewall that would protect from DDoS attacks or SQL intrusions is not used from the beginning onward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.6">Or certificates expire because the cloud native certificate manager that also renews certificates is not being used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.7">There will also be a risk that compliance requirements cannot be met. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.8">These factors can result in reputational damage, negatively impacting our business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.9">Therefore, it is best to address security right from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.827.1">the beginning.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.828.1">Cloud native versus microservices</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.1">Another misunderstanding is that cloud native and microservices have the same meaning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.2">People sometimes use the two terms interchangeably, but they differ in some respects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.3">Cloud native is an overarching approach that includes a variety of practices and tools for developing and running applications in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.4">It focuses on scalability, resilience, continuous delivery, and leveraging cloud infrastructure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.5">Cloud native includes containerization, orchestration, a DevSecOps culture, and automation through CI/CD pipelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.6">It addresses the entire SDLC and operations in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.7">The microservices concept provides architecture guidance specifically on how to break down applications into smaller, independently deployable components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.8">Cloud native applications leverage features and infrastructure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.9">They are designed to run in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.10">A microservices architecture can be applied to any application, whether hosted on-premises or in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.11">Microservices</span><a id="_idIndexMarker146"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.1"> hosted in the cloud can be part of a cloud </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.831.1">native strategy.</span></span></p>
