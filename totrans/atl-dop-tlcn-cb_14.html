			<h1 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>Appendix – Key Takeaways and the Future of Atlassian DevOps Tools</h1>
			<p>Throughout this book, we have demonstrated how to easily apply integrations to core Atlassian tools and create a DevOps toolchain. But this often raises the question, “Is <span class="No-Break">this it?”</span></p>
			<p>The good news is that Atlassian is continually adding new features to its cloud products that we have showcased throughout this book in previous chapters. Many of these features allow for easy interconnection between Atlassian products to improve visibility and <span class="No-Break">status tracking.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will focus on the immediate future of Atlassian products and your use of these products. We will center our focus on the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Atlassian Intelligence</span></li>
				<li>Best practices for setting up <span class="No-Break">your toolchain</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s begin our examination of the future with a look at Atlassian’s application of <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">machine </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">learning</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ML</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor293"/>Atlassian Intelligence and other AI technologies</h1>
			<p>Atlassian <a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/>first introduced <strong class="bold">Atlassian Intelligence</strong> in April 2023, and it has changed the way users use Atlassian tools. Not all tools have Atlassian Intelligence enabled, but the main products – Jira, Confluence, and Jira Service Management – have exciting new features that make it easier to use <span class="No-Break">these tools.</span></p>
			<p>Starting off with Jira, Atlassian Intelligence makes it easier to find issues. Prior to Atlassian Intelligence being available in Jira, users could create complex <strong class="bold">Jira Query Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">JQL</strong>) searches <a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/>to find issues of interest. Now, with Atlassian Intelligence, Atlassian allows you<a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/> to use <strong class="bold">natural language</strong> (<strong class="bold">NL</strong>) to simply ask Jira about issues you are interested in. Then, Atlassian Intelligence will write the JQL search on your behalf and return the <span class="No-Break">relevant results.</span></p>
			<p>Atlassian Intelligence does not stop at helping you with your search queries. As you are creating issues, you can leverage the power of Atlassian Intelligence to help you create your issues. Atlassian Intelligence can help you brainstorm ideas and help populate a description of your issues. This can be very helpful whenever you need a little nudge or sprinkle of inspiration to <span class="No-Break">get going.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, Atlassian Intelligence <a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/>helps you change the tone of your writing. The tone is sometimes difficult to convey in written form, and the primary way users interact with Jira is through written words. This can lead to conflicts, confusion, and disagreements. Luckily, Atlassian Intelligence helps users improve their writing by rewriting text into different types <span class="No-Break">of tones.</span></p>
			<p>Confluence also has some very exciting new features that are powered by Atlassian Intelligence. Similar to Jira’s JQL, Confluence also has a powerful search capability that allows users to find data. Historically, data searches through Confluence pages and relevant pages were returned back to the user. Now, with the power of Atlassian Intelligence, not only are relevant pages returned, but an answer to the user’s query is returned as well. This changes the way users search for information within Confluence because instead of looking for keywords and hoping that they find some information, Atlassian Intelligence builds an answer for you. The best part is that a user can use NL to ask their question in Confluence instead of relying <span class="No-Break">on keywords.</span></p>
			<p>Another Atlassian Intelligence feature in Confluence is the ability to help you look up words. Many teams have technical terms that are specific to their team or company. These technical terms are typically common knowledge for team members, but for new team members, it can be challenging to keep up with the definitions of all these terms. Luckily for these new employees, Atlassian Intelligence can easily search through all available Confluence data to help them figure out what a term means. This is great because it doesn’t go out to the internet to find what the term means but rather sources that data from the company’s personal data, which increases the likelihood that a relevant definition <span class="No-Break">is found.</span></p>
			<p>One last Atlassian Intelligence feature worth noting in Confluence is the ability to summarize Confluence pages for a user. Pages tend to contain a lot of data, and it can be hard to fully digest all the information contained within a page. With Atlassian Intelligence, a user can receive a summarized view of the page, highlighting key pieces of information that a user should <span class="No-Break">know about.</span></p>
			<p>Atlassian Intelligence <a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/>is still fairly new, and Atlassian continues to improve it. Keep an eye out as Atlassian continues to expand the capabilities of Atlassian Intelligence and spread these to other products in the <span class="No-Break">Atlassian suite.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor294"/>Best practices for setting up your toolchain</h1>
			<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/> have learned in this book, setting up all the tools and getting them all configured is an involved process. At this point, you should have all the tools configured, and your DevOps tools should be ready for your team to increase their collaboration and efficiency. Next are some best practices that you should consider when setting up your toolchain to ensure a smoother time setting <span class="No-Break">things up:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define clear objectives</strong>: Before you start deploying your DevOps tools, figure out what it is you want to achieve. Many different DevOps tools do almost the exact same thing, and picking between them might not be trivial. This book focuses on Atlassian tools, but there are many different alternatives. If your company’s objective was to stay within the Atlassian ecosystem, then this book set you up to meet <span class="No-Break">that objective.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Select the right tools</strong>: With a clear objective in mind, you need to select the right set of tools. As mentioned before, there are many DevOps tools that are very similar in price and functionality. Evaluate each tool, understanding the pros and cons of each tool with respect to what you and your team need. Avoid signing up multiple tools that end up doing the same thing because this only adds complexity to your DevOps tools and increases the overall spend and inefficiency of <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Standardize your workflow</strong>: It can be tempting to create a unique workflow or process for each of your developer teams. Ideally, your company should have a well-defined process on how to utilize your DevOps tools. Avoid having unnecessary steps or steps that could create confusion for your team. Working out of the same operating model can help increase team collaboration, communication, and effectiveness since they will all speak a common language. Make sure your process is well documented and as you onboard new employees, they become familiar with your process. Refine your process regularly as you make new discoveries or get more efficiency out of your tools <span class="No-Break">and processes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automate the process</strong>: Automate as much as possible; this doesn’t mean automate <a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/>everything. Automate parts of your process and toolchain that make sense. Don’t automate for the sake of automating. Having a human in the loop may be required until your team or process matures over time. Don’t try to automate everything on day one if your team doesn’t fully understand how to do the work <span class="No-Break">manually first.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Track the performance</strong>: Monitor and measure the performance of your DevOps tools and processes. There is always room for improvement, and regularly revisiting your tools and processes can help increase your team’s effectiveness and throughput. Establish some metrics around <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>) that will guide your team through their <span class="No-Break">DevOps journey.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Maintain security and compliance</strong>: Regularly review your configurations and processes to ensure that your team is keeping up with the latest trends and threats in the cyber security space. Review your code review practices, vulnerability scans, and access control policies to make sure that your team is always adapting to the ever-changing <span class="No-Break">cyber landscape.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collaborate and communicate</strong>: Having great DevOps tools is fantastic, but no matter how great your toolchain is, make sure you encourage your team to collaborate and communicate. Your DevOps tools are there to help your team, but they should not be there to replace your team’s interactions with <span class="No-Break">each other.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Training and development</strong>: Finally, train your team on how to use your tools. DevOps can be confusing for your team, especially new team members who might not be too familiar with your infrastructure. Get in the habit of training new members and providing refresher training for existing employees. As you make changes and improvements to your process and toolchain, remember to update<a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/> your documentation and, if needed, share those changes with the rest of your team. Encourage a culture of sharing new discoveries or better ways of using <span class="No-Break">your tools.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, DevOps is more of a journey and less of a destination. This book was designed to get you started and help you jumpstart your DevOps toolchain. As your team continues to utilize the tools that were configured in this book, you should continue to improve upon your toolchain and defined processes. In this book, we explored the entire DevOps lifecycle and covered configurations for Jira, Jira Product Discovery, Bitbucket, Compass, Opsgenie, and much more. This. is only the beginning. Your team will naturally continue to tweak and make changes to <span class="No-Break">your configurations.</span></p>
			<p>This book has covered how important and valuable it is to choose the right set of DevOps tools. The Atlassian tool suite is designed to work well together, and any team using Jira or Confluence should highly consider folding in the rest of the <span class="No-Break">Atlassian tools.</span></p>
			<p>As we conclude this book, we want to remind you that this is only the beginning. Now that you have a functioning set of tools, it is time for your team to really leverage the power of DevOps to take your software quality and software development efficiencies to the next level. DevOps is about continuously learning and improving, and your tools should follow the <span class="No-Break">same practice.</span></p>
			<p>We hope that this book has provided you with valuable insights, knowledge, and inspiration to lead your team’s DevOps efforts. Thank you for joining us on this journey, and we wish you all <span class="No-Break">the best!</span></p>
