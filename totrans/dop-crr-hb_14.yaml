- en: In 2005, the decision to attend college for mechanical engineering at the *University
    of Minnesota* was made. In college, I needed to take a C++ computer science class.
    This class was the extent of a software-related course that could be taken in
    college; however, the course got me inspired to continue exploring programming
    and what could be done with it. This fascination led to me purchasing a microcontroller
    board, similar to what is known as an Arduino. I ended up creating a hosted web
    page on a web server, which lead to a dorm room that could be monitored from a
    computer.

    which inspired my interest in automation. The professor for my course also spurred
    my interest in automation. In the lab, we decided on a product we had to manufacture
    with no human interaction – we chose a wooden cribbage board. We were broken into
    groups of three and assigned a Fanuc six-axis robot, as well as a stage of the
    manufacturing process we were responsible for. My team was responsible for the
    packaging cell. After the cribbage board was created, it needed to be placed in
    a box, labeled, and shipped. I became very interested in the entire process and
    ended up spending far more time in the lab working on my cell, as well as helping
    other cells integrate with ours. The professor became the first academic mentor
    I had and was the reason I ended up taking the job I did out of college.

    did not enjoy but took because of the exposure I was able to get with automation
    in an industrial setting. I sucked in as much as I could from my senior colleagues
    who worked in the automation department; one individual told me that it was impossible
    to master something quickly when you spend only a small portion of your time working
    on it. He recommended that I buy a used microcontroller to play around with on
    my own. I did and ended up setting up a home lab that grew into home automation
    tasks, and eventually into a fully automated home.

    engineer working in the oil and gas industry in western North Dakota. During my
    tenure as an automation engineer, I was exposed to **supervisory control and data
    acquisition** (**SCADA**) systems. The engineers working on SCADA systems were
    developing software in Java and using Maven, Subversion, and Eclipse. I began
    researching software development in my free time and began learning new programming
    languages and tools in my spare time. Once I felt comfortable with programming,
    I began applying for jobs as a software engineer for the same company. Eventually,
    I landed my first software engineering role.

    and a challenge to solve. I had a knack for picking up programming languages pretty
    quickly and wished to work with a more diverse code base. Another thing that I
    was struggling with was balancing work and life, or a lack thereof. I lived in
    Minnesota but needed to commute to western North Dakota frequently. I knew several
    individuals who worked at United Healthcare that continually encouraged me to
    apply. I applied to half a dozen software engineering roles I thought I was a
    good fit for.

    analyst, but they would like to move into a higher-paying software engineering
    role. They have heard of software boot camps and are considering leaving their
    job to attend a 6-month boot camp. I strongly caution against doing this; first,
    you are not guaranteed a job after you graduate. You could go through the boot
    camp, only to come out and not be able to land a job. The second reason I do not
    feel it is a great idea to leave a job without a solid job offer in hand is that
    you will go into debt for tens of thousands of dollars. Instead, I recommend staying
    at your current job and taking advantage of the tuition reimbursement your company
    offers. Use these funds to take programming courses, get certifications, and even
    pursue an online degree. On top of this, something you can do even if your company
    does not offer tuition reimbursement is research and study on your own. Think
    of the amount of time you spend watching Netflix and playing video games; use
    a portion of this time to learn new things that will help you land your next job.

    have similar opinions.
