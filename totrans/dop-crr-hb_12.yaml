    into too much detail. In this chapter, we will continue this discussion by diving
    deeper into the topic, including the different steps, the different people you
    may speak to, and how to best prepare for each level. To do this, I will highlight
    specific examples and extra details regarding typical and non-typical interviews.
    From coding challenges, design, situational, and IQ tests to everything in between,
    I will try to cover everything and give you tips to become bulletproof, regardless
    of the type of interview you may encounter.

    the depth and breadth of your technical knowledge; there is only so much preparation
    you can do between the interview with the hiring manager and this phase. It is
    best if you do not misrepresent your skill set so that you are not asked about
    things you have no experience or proficiency in. If you do encounter something
    you do not know, explain that you have not worked in that area in the past, but
    that you are interested in doing so. If you pull something out of left field,
    you may cause irreparable harm to the trust relationship you are trying to build.

    to the more sophisticated instances, where they may give you a design, code, or
    architecture challenge to do ahead of time, only to discuss it in person once
    submitted. Simple technical screens usually consist of a panel or multiple individual
    interviewers, where you can expect your technical knowledge to be explored for
    depth and breadth. Remember, anything in your resume is fair game.

    general coding proficiency (for example, how would you implement this *XYZ?)*

    a new application or service and building the respective infrastructure and services.
    It may require you to make decisions around databases, security, or even areas
    more traditionally focused on application development. Some companies will test
    to see how well you understand the entire application stack. It is important to
    have some high-level understanding, especially in the cloud. You should know how
    to segregate and secure networks, as well as how to prevent the internet from
    accessing your backend and databases. You should know how to do authentication
    and create security groups and understand networking well. Distinct roles will
    have different focuses. Some will want to focus more on containerization and may
    go deeper into Kubernetes. Some may cover serverless. Getting a few certifications
    under your belt ensures you have a broad understanding of services that you may
    not have used professionally. They also help differentiate you from the competing
    interviewers.

  zh: 设计面试或挑战有些不同。它专注于创建一个新的应用程序或服务，并构建相应的基础设施和服务。可能需要你在数据库、安全性等方面做出决策，甚至涉及一些传统上更侧重于应用程序开发的领域。一些公司会考察你对整个应用程序堆栈的理解程度。拥有一定的高层次理解是非常重要的，尤其是在云计算领域。你应该知道如何划分和保护网络，以及如何防止互联网访问你的后端和数据库。你应该知道如何进行身份验证、创建安全组，并且对网络有很好的理解。不同的角色将有不同的侧重点。有些公司会更关注容器化，可能会深入探讨Kubernetes。有些公司则可能涉及无服务器架构。获得一些认证有助于确保你对可能未曾在职业生涯中使用过的服务有广泛的理解。同时，它们也帮助你在面试竞争者中脱颖而出。

    on LinkedIn and see what they do. In my experience, if they are in a different
    area than you, such as **quality assurance** (**QA**) and testing, it is usually
    a cultural or team fit type of interview, which may have a few situational questions.

- en: Now, if you have been interviewing with multiple companies concurrently, you
    may be in the process of receiving more than one offer and potentially be able
    to negotiate further. Be careful with overplaying your hand, since companies may
    rescind their offer if they think you are just using them to get a better offer
    elsewhere or to improve your existing situation at work. The point is that you

- en: You should focus on being very enthusiastic about the role, even while you negotiate.
    Also, try to be flexible when it comes to improvements in your offer, since they
    may have more flexibility in one area than another. Be wary of telling all your
    other opportunities that you have received an offer too early, as it may prove
    counterproductive. Do not mention companies by name or give away too much in terms
    of the specifics. If you get two or more offers, then negotiate in earnest, but
    only do so if you are willing to walk away from the opportunity you are trying
    to improve.

  zh: 在谈判时，你应该专注于表现出对这个角色非常热情。此外，在待遇上，尽量保持灵活性，因为他们在某些方面可能比其他方面更有弹性。谨慎地不要过早告诉你其他的机会已经收到了offer，因为这可能适得其反。不要提及公司名称，也不要透露过多的具体情况。如果你收到了两个或更多的offer，那么可以开始认真谈判，但前提是你愿意放弃你正在争取的机会。
- en: Sometimes, people will take the offer back to the company they work for and
    get a raise. This might be a good short-term way to get a raise out of band but
    it can also generate negative feedback and, depending on the employment market,
    they may look for some insurance in the future so that it does not happen again.
    Take this case by case. If you have not received a raise in several years and
    you get an offer, negotiate on both ends. Just try to manage your options so that
    you are still on good terms with both companies after deciding.

    which we have talked about previously. For traditional programming tests, [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)
    is a suitable place to start, as is [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
    For books, check out *Cracking the coding interview*, by *Gayle Laakmann McDowell,*
    which contains a lot of tips specific to companies.

- en: For design, this is a little bit more complicated, but there are a few good
    books that go in-depth into system design and can help you not only on offline
    tests but also in working through a design problem live with an interviewer. For
    cloud-related design, check out reference architectures from the cloud provider
    itself. If you study a few samples, you will get a handle on what is common to
    a lot of scenarios and be able to think of solutions more rapidly. I recommend
    that you become acquainted with at least one tool for diagramming and try to design
    a sample three-tier application in the tool before you are forced to do this live.

  zh: 对于设计来说，这会稍微复杂一些，但有一些很好的书籍深入讲解了系统设计，不仅能帮助你应对线下测试，还能在与面试官现场解答设计问题时提供帮助。对于与云相关的设计，可以参考云服务提供商提供的参考架构。如果你研究几种样本，你将能掌握很多场景的共性，更快速地想到解决方案。我建议你熟悉至少一种图表工具，并在被迫现场设计之前，尝试在该工具中设计一个示范性的三层应用。
- en: You could encounter a non-conventional problem, such as the famous *how many
    manholes in New York* or something like that. I was asked what I would do if I
    was shrunk down and put in a blender. I was also asked to design the process for
    a map application from the ground up, in an underdeveloped country lacking infrastructure.
    A company may also ask you to design one of their services, improve it, or create
    something new. A lot of big tech companies may screen you this way, regardless
    of your specific technical role, so saying you are in *DevOps* may not preclude
    you from this.

    As always, ask your recruiter what to expect and if the company is large enough,
    the internet is bound to have additional intelligence on what types of questions
    or design problems they can throw at you. What matters the most in these types
    of exercises is that you can convey your thinking, that it is clear and logical,
    and that you consider exceptions and edge cases when devising solutions.

    interesting or as heroic, or that you may not have an arsenal ready to use at
    a moment's notice. This might be a pain, but the solution is simple. Create a
    document and start working on stories, answering sample questions in the STAR
    format. You do not want to repeat stories in the same interview loop with the
    same company, so make sure you can pivot to a different story if there is a similar
    question that you have already used your story for.
