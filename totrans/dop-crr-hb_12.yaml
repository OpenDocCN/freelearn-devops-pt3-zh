    into too much detail. In this chapter, we will continue this discussion by diving
    deeper into the topic, including the different steps, the different people you
    may speak to, and how to best prepare for each level. To do this, I will highlight
    specific examples and extra details regarding typical and non-typical interviews.
    From coding challenges, design, situational, and IQ tests to everything in between,
    I will try to cover everything and give you tips to become bulletproof, regardless
    of the type of interview you may encounter.

    manager, or the individual who will assess your qualifications and fit for the
    role. It is the interview that occurs after you have completed the human resources
    screening call successfully.

    challenges in the past. This helps leave them with the impression that you know
    how to solve the challenges that they are facing and it is a wonderful way to
    end the call.

    the depth and breadth of your technical knowledge; there is only so much preparation
    you can do between the interview with the hiring manager and this phase. It is
    best if you do not misrepresent your skill set so that you are not asked about
    things you have no experience or proficiency in. If you do encounter something
    you do not know, explain that you have not worked in that area in the past, but
    that you are interested in doing so. If you pull something out of left field,
    you may cause irreparable harm to the trust relationship you are trying to build.

    from most common scenarios, where one or more people ask you technical questions,
    to the more sophisticated instances, where they may give you a design, code, or
    architecture challenge to do ahead of time, only to discuss it in person once
    submitted. Simple technical screens usually consist of a panel or multiple individual
    interviewers, where you can expect your technical knowledge to be explored for
    depth and breadth. Remember, anything in your resume is fair game.

    general coding proficiency (for example, how would you implement this *XYZ?)*

    you just have a day or two to return the test and there is no way to know if you
    googled the answer, to sophisticated third-party proctored tests, where a real
    person will watch you code. Some companies may want to watch you code live and
    ask you questions as you work on your solution.

    a new application or service and building the respective infrastructure and services.
    It may require you to make decisions around databases, security, or even areas
    more traditionally focused on application development. Some companies will test
    to see how well you understand the entire application stack. It is important to
    have some high-level understanding, especially in the cloud. You should know how
    to segregate and secure networks, as well as how to prevent the internet from
    accessing your backend and databases. You should know how to do authentication
    and create security groups and understand networking well. Distinct roles will
    have different focuses. Some will want to focus more on containerization and may
    go deeper into Kubernetes. Some may cover serverless. Getting a few certifications
    under your belt ensures you have a broad understanding of services that you may
    not have used professionally. They also help differentiate you from the competing
    interviewers.

    on LinkedIn and see what they do. In my experience, if they are in a different
    area than you, such as **quality assurance** (**QA**) and testing, it is usually
    a cultural or team fit type of interview, which may have a few situational questions.
    If it is in your area, they may want to know more about your specific experiences

    in your interview process, such as being *too hands-on* or *not hands-on enough*,

    recruiter or HR person has reached out to let you know they would like to make
    you an offer! Typically, they make a verbal offer and if you accept verbally,
    they will extend a written one, which usually has an expiration date – around
    48 hours to a week.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    may be in the process of receiving more than one offer and potentially be able
    to negotiate further. Be careful with overplaying your hand, since companies may
    rescind their offer if they think you are just using them to get a better offer
    elsewhere or to improve your existing situation at work. The point is that you
    should tread carefully as the job is not yours yet, so treat this as the final
    stage of the interview.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should focus on being very enthusiastic about the role, even while you negotiate.
    Also, try to be flexible when it comes to improvements in your offer, since they
    may have more flexibility in one area than another. Be wary of telling all your
    other opportunities that you have received an offer too early, as it may prove
    counterproductive. Do not mention companies by name or give away too much in terms
    of the specifics. If you get two or more offers, then negotiate in earnest, but
    only do so if you are willing to walk away from the opportunity you are trying
    to improve.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, people will take the offer back to the company they work for and
    get a raise. This might be a good short-term way to get a raise out of band but
    it can also generate negative feedback and, depending on the employment market,
    they may look for some insurance in the future so that it does not happen again.
    Take this case by case. If you have not received a raise in several years and
    you get an offer, negotiate on both ends. Just try to manage your options so that
    you are still on good terms with both companies after deciding.

    15+ question exams.

    IQ test, albeit with a lot less time dedicated to this. I have taken the **Criteria
    Cognitive Aptitude Test** (**CCAT**) several times, and it is 50 questions in
    15 minutes. Only once did I finish all 50, and there was a generous amount of
    guessing to get that done. The questions range from math and logic questions to
    spatial and verbal questions such as analogies or antonyms. It requires all your
    focus, so try not to take these types of tests when you are tired or may be distracted.

    they invest in take these tests! There is not much you can do to prepare for these
    types of tests, but you can stack the deck in your favor by making sure you have
    15 minutes of uninterrupted focus, at the time when your brain operates at peak
    capacity. Since you are not penalized for guessing, you should always dedicate
    the last minute to guessing all the remaining questions.

    cloud-related design, check out reference architectures from the cloud provider
    itself. If you study a few samples, you will get a handle on what is common to
    a lot of scenarios and be able to think of solutions more rapidly. I recommend

    a sample three-tier application in the tool before you are forced to do this live.

    a map application from the ground up, in an underdeveloped country lacking infrastructure.
    A company may also ask you to design one of their services, improve it, or create
    something new. A lot of big tech companies may screen you this way, regardless
