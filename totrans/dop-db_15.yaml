    My journey has been both a privilege and a source of immense pride. Not only am
    I deeply passionate about the roles I’ve undertaken, but I’ve also had the fortune
    to witness and contribute to pivotal shifts in the industry. This chapter seeks
    to encapsulate my unique experiences, tracing back to my foundational role as
    a developer at a Hungarian university. My true initiation began at IBM, delving
    into the intricacies of **high availability** (**HA**) distributed systems. At
    Lufthansa, I bridged the realms of tech and aviation, spearheading transformative
    projects. My stint at Symantec focused my skills in security and resilience, emphasizing
    data persistence. Sky UK deepened my grasp on data persistence technologies, whereas
    at Oracle, I was at the forefront of developing their maiden public cloud services,
    concentrating on compute and persistence. My leadership skills shone at Vodafone,
    overseeing the entire **site reliability engineering** (**SRE**) framework. Now,
    with **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**), I’m pushing the envelope in data, analytics,
    **artificial intelligence** (**AI**), **machine learning** (**ML**), and emerging
    tech. Reflecting on these two decades, my commitment to innovation and excellence
    has cemented my position in the global tech panorama.

    It is the cornerstone of strategic decision-making and operational efficiency,
    shaping the way organizations grow and compete. This chapter highlights the imperative
    role of data in businesses, the relevance of understanding and mastering it for
    DevOps, SREs, IT professionals, and business executives, and the ways in which
    a data-driven approach can create tangible business value.

    when processed and analyzed. In an organization, data can originate from various
    sources, such as transactional systems, IoT devices, or customer interactions,
    and it is typically structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. Understanding
    the various data types, their sources, and how they flow across an organization’s
    ecosystem is a fundamental step in exploiting the potential of data. By mastering
    these basics, professionals from both technical and business realms can effectively
    communicate, making strategic decisions that align with the organization’s goals.

    practices, processes, and frameworks that ensure data quality, security, and accessibility.
    Adhering to a robust data governance strategy helps businesses uphold data integrity,
    streamline operations, and comply with regulations such as the **General Data
    Protection Regulation** (**GDPR**). Compliance with such regulations is not merely
    a legal necessity but also a way to foster trust with customers and partners,
    emphasizing the company’s commitment to data privacy and security.

    and business stakeholders. This cross-functional team setup facilitates a holistic
    view of the business’s data needs, promoting a more seamless and efficient workflow.
    Moreover, it places a high emphasis on automation, CI, testing, and monitoring
    to improve data quality and speed up the delivery of data workloads.

    reliability, availability, and performance. These principles include defining
    **service-level objectives** (**SLOs**) and **service-level indicators** (**SLIs**)
    for databases and data pipelines, implementing error budgets for data systems,
    and treating data incidents and outages with the same rigor as application-level
    incidents.

    innovation and the risk of system instability. This principle, when applied to
    data systems, ensures that they are reliable and meet their users’ expectations.

    of databases, analytics, AI, and ML systems. This integration reshapes established
    practices and workflows, bringing greater automation, reliability, speed, and
    security to the development and operation of data-intensive applications and systems.
    It’s a new frontier of DevOps and SRE, where data, AI, and ML are at the heart
    of operations, creating not only technological challenges but also opportunities
    for innovation and growth.

- en: In 2009, the term “DevOps” was only just emerging, and its principles were far
    from widespread adoption. Traditional software development was marked by silos,
    where developers and operations teams worked separately. This disjointed approach
    often led to significant bottlenecks in the software delivery process, causing
    delays and conflicts.

    databases were the norm, and NoSQL databases were just beginning to gain traction.
    The management of these systems was largely manual, and they were often treated
    as separate entities from the applications they supported.

    in 2009 to more integrated, proactive, and automated practices in 2023\. The role
    of data has also evolved from being a byproduct of operations to a central component
    driving operational and business decisions. While the journey hasn’t been without
    challenges, these advances have led to more efficient, reliable, and secure software
    delivery and management.
