The knowledge you will gain from this chapter will be instrumental in helping you avoid instability and disruptions in your <span class="No-Break">Salesforce environment.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>How to manage your Salesforce environments</h1>
			<p>Managing your <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>Salesforce environment is crucial for the stability and effectiveness of your organization’s operations. The importance of this task cannot be overstated – a well-managed Salesforce environment ensures seamless workflows, data integrity, and optimal performance. The consequences of neglecting this aspect can be severe. You can experience a cascade of issues starting with minor data discrepancies, which can escalate into major workflow disruptions. Eventually, these problems can lead to a substantial loss in customer trust and a notable drop <span class="No-Break">in revenue.</span></p>
			<p>This underscores that, without vigilant management, the risk of operational disruptions, compromised data security, and, ultimately, financial and reputational damage increases significantly. In the following sections, we will delve into the different types of monitoring that are necessary for maintaining the health and alignment of your Salesforce environments, illustrating why proactive and comprehensive management is not just beneficial but essential for any enterprise <span class="No-Break">leveraging Salesforce.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>The need for monitoring</h2>
			<p>We strive<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> to maintain stability and integrity across our Salesforce environments. But uncontrolled changes, no matter how well-intentioned, can undermine our efforts. A developer tweaks a validation rule directly in production. An<a id="_idIndexMarker415"/> admin deletes some ostensibly outdated fields in a sandbox. Changes occur outside the pipeline that cause environments to drift out of sync. Before we know it, we’re battling instability instead <span class="No-Break">of innovating.</span></p>
			<p>Change management is non-negotiable for enterprise Salesforce development. However, manual change control has limitations. As environments and team sizes grow, we need automation to stay on top of changes. Comprehensive environment monitoring gives us <span class="No-Break">that advantage.</span></p>
			<p>In the context <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>of DevOps and system monitoring, it is crucial to emphasize the significance of a robust deployment process as the primary line of defense against unforeseen system alterations. An efficient and straightforward deployment process minimizes the likelihood of circumventing source control, thereby<a id="_idIndexMarker417"/> reducing the risk of unexpected changes. While monitoring remains an essential aspect, refining the deployment process can substantially decrease the frequency and severity of anomalies detected during monitoring. This approach underlines the interdependence between deployment strategies and monitoring efficacy, illustrating that improvements in deployment procedures can lead to a more stable and predictable <span class="No-Break">system behavior.</span></p>
			<p>Robust monitoring goes<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> beyond production <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>and examines changes throughout our environments. Sandboxes, especially developer sandboxes, are hotbeds of experimentation. Changes here may intentionally fall outside the pipeline at first. But we still need visibility. Staging and testing sandboxes also require oversight to prevent unvalidated changes <span class="No-Break">from proliferating.</span></p>
			<p>With<a id="_idIndexMarker420"/> automated monitoring, we can detect changes across all our environments, not just production. The most advanced tools capture point-in-time snapshots of metadata and compare them to identify modifications. This allows us to see the who, what, when, and where of all changes, both intended <span class="No-Break">and unintended.</span></p>
			<p>Metadata monitoring <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>focuses specifically on changes to components such as custom objects, fields, Apex classes, and Lightning pages. But keeping tabs on other environmental factors is also key. Data metrics can help us spot many problems before they impact <span class="No-Break">the user.</span></p>
			<p>Monitoring<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> changes gives us crucial insights into the health of our environments. We gain confidence that environments align with the source of truth. We can validate that the intended changes propagate properly through the pipeline. We can also rapidly respond to unintended changes before they create <span class="No-Break">stability issues.</span></p>
			<p>By combining proactive monitoring with streamlined remediation, we can take control of changes in Salesforce. Our development teams gain the freedom to innovate without jeopardizing stability. Architects sleep easier knowing environments align with design, and our users enjoy maximum uptime and productivity. In the following sections, we’ll dive into these topics in <span class="No-Break">greater detail.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Exploring different kinds of monitoring</h2>
			<p>Effective monitoring <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>is the cornerstone of maintaining and improving the performance, security, and reliability of systems. Different kinds of monitoring cater to diverse aspects of Salesforce environments, each serving a unique purpose and providing distinct insights. Understanding these varieties is not just about gathering data; it’s about strategically utilizing this information to make informed decisions and proactively <span class="No-Break">manage systems.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we’ll delve into the various forms of monitoring – from metadata and data pattern monitoring to posture monitoring and operational observability. Each type plays a critical role in understanding and optimizing a <span class="No-Break">Salesforce environment.</span></p>
			<h3>Metadata monitoring</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Metadata monitoring</strong> refers <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>to the practice of tracking changes<a id="_idIndexMarker425"/> made to Salesforce metadata components such as custom objects, fields, workflows, and Apex code. By monitoring metadata, admins can stay aware of configuration changes being made across their orgs with relatively low latency. This gives visibility into who made what changes and when, which is useful for troubleshooting, compliance, and change management. The goal of metadata monitoring is to maintain control and transparency over customizations as teams scale their Salesforce development. Rather than manual checks, automated tools can watch metadata around the clock and alert the required people on <span class="No-Break">important updates.</span></p>
			<h3>Monitoring changes and patterns in Salesforce data</h3>
			<p>In addition to <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>monitoring metadata, it’s important to monitor<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> changes and patterns in Salesforce data itself. Configuration data, such as CPQ configurations, should be tracked as though it were metadata. Data anomalies such as spikes, drops, or outliers should be monitored for potential data quality issues or business changes. Ongoing data behavior such as growth trends, usage patterns, and data flows should be analyzed to inform capacity planning and optimization. Automated tools can apply logic to surface insights from production data in real time. The goal is to gain visibility into both data stability and change to proactively identify and address <span class="No-Break">potential problems.</span></p>
			<h3>Monitoring posture</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Posture monitoring</strong> refers <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>to evaluating the overall <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>security health of a Salesforce org. This includes tracking configuration settings such as user permissions, credential policies, and sharing rules to detect risky settings that could enable access exposures or breaches. Posture monitoring also means analyzing usage patterns to identify abnormal end user or integration behavior that could signal compromised credentials or attacks. Tools can automatically check configurations against security benchmarks and alert when potential vulnerabilities are introduced. The goal is to achieve ongoing visibility into the security standing of Salesforce orgs and prompt notifications of changes that induce risk. Posture monitoring enables admins to proactively remediate issues before they can be exploited and maintain the secure posture of <span class="No-Break">their instances.</span></p>
			<h3>Operational monitoring and observability</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Operational monitoring</strong> refers <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>to tracking the performance, availability, and overall health of applications and infrastructure in production <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>environments. This includes monitoring metrics such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization to detect problems and optimize configurations. Observability builds on operational monitoring by incorporating additional signals such as logs, traces, and custom telemetry to gain deeper context and insights into <span class="No-Break">system behavior.</span></p>
			<p>Together, operational monitoring and observability provide the real-time visibility required to keep applications and services running smoothly. However, the focus is on monitoring the current state rather than changes over time. While important disciplines in their own right, operational monitoring and observability are distinct from the change monitoring we have covered. Change monitoring, for instance, might focus on how customizations evolve over time, while operational monitoring might focus on whether the deployed customizations keep functioning within their performance parameters and continue to meet their <span class="No-Break">acceptance criteria.</span></p>
			<p>The goal of change monitoring is tracking alterations to configurations, data, and security to identify risks, issues, and improvement opportunities proactively through alerts and audit trails. In contrast, operational monitoring and observability aim to facilitate rapid troubleshooting and optimization reactively when performance problems or outages occur in production. Since our focus is on change monitoring rather than current state visibility, we will not be covering the specifics of operational monitoring or observability practices in this book. However, they are complementary disciplines that are part of a comprehensive <span class="No-Break">monitoring strategy.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we introduced an extensive range of topics, from the necessity of metadata and data pattern monitoring to the critical aspects of posture monitoring and operational observability. We learned that each form of monitoring plays a pivotal role in not only safeguarding the integrity and security of our Salesforce orgs but also in enhancing their performance and reliability. We will now move on to monitoring the changes to our <span class="No-Break">organization’s metadata.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Monitoring metadata</h1>
			<p>In this section, we’ll delve <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>into the pivotal role of metadata monitoring within the Salesforce platform, an aspect that stands as the cornerstone of environment control and management. Metadata, the underlying structure defining every component in your Salesforce org, undergoes constant evolution as your organization customizes <span class="No-Break">and expands.</span></p>
			<p>By providing a comprehensive overview of how and why metadata should be monitored, we aim to underscore the necessity of implementing robust metadata monitoring strategies, thus ensuring a more controlled, transparent, and efficient <span class="No-Break">Salesforce environment.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Why monitor metadata?</h2>
			<p>Monitoring changes made to metadata is an essential discipline. As you customize and expand your org, the associated metadata evolves as well. This happens because everything in the core Salesforce platform exists as metadata, so any change you make results in changing<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> that metadata. This also means your metadata gets more complex as your level of <span class="No-Break">customization increases.</span></p>
			<p>Tracking these metadata changes provides the following <span class="No-Break">multifaceted benefits:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enabling collaboration</strong>: With visibility into metadata alterations, developers can avoid costly overwrites of parallel work in progress. Developers and admins share a common understanding of the current state across connected orgs, <span class="No-Break">reducing misalignments.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accelerating development</strong>: Identifying misalignments early prevents cascading reworks. If a new field was added to a sandbox but not production, catching this early prevents wasted efforts building on top of the <span class="No-Break">discrepant metadata.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Supporting compliance</strong>: Detailed metadata change history satisfies governance processes requiring audit trails of modifications. On-demand reports can validate that proper protocols <span class="No-Break">were followed.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Without<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> comprehensive monitoring, metadata changes can accumulate in the shadows and go unchecked. Perhaps a developer adds a field in a sandbox but neglects to deploy it to production. An admin directly adjusts a validation rule in production to fix a bug. These small undetected misalignments slowly snowball into <span class="No-Break">major headaches.</span></p>
			<p>Manual tracking and loose version control workflows have blind spots. Metadata alterations inevitably slip by unnoticed. Automated solutions can close these gaps by regularly cataloging metadata state across all connected orgs down to the most granular components, but they come at a cost. Comparisons reveal precise differences, highlighting each metadata addition, deletion, or modification in <span class="No-Break">any environment.</span></p>
			<p>With a more comprehensive view, architects can gain more visibility into the shape and stability of their Salesforce environments. Developers proceed with confidence, assured parallel work will not be overwritten. Products and admins collaborate from a shared source of truth. Compliance teams have an audit trail <span class="No-Break">of modifications.</span></p>
			<p>As architects, we often work as stewards of the long-term health of the environments we work with, and diligently tracking changes to metadata can be an important part of that. Fortunately, solutions exist to fit robust metadata oversight seamlessly into modern development practices. We will explore this in the <span class="No-Break">following sections.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Monitoring metadata in production</h2>
			<p>Monitoring metadata<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> changes in production orgs is critical for maintaining transparency and control as environments scale and evolve. The main objective is to gain ongoing visibility into customizations being made across the org by various teams and individuals. Even if these components are deployed through a CI/CD pipeline, we still need the security of knowing that the metadata in production is as expected. By tracking all metadata component additions, edits, deletions, and deployments, admins can stay aware of new features and configurations entering the org in real time rather than manually piecing together change activity after <span class="No-Break">the fact.</span></p>
			<p>With <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>metadata change visibility, admins can identify who made what changes, when to support auditing, when to troubleshoot, and change management processes. Monitoring metadata enables identifying consequences and tracing the causes back to a specific configuration change that introduced an issue. It also supports compliance by providing documentation of all customizations. Additionally, monitoring metadata changes helps surface unnecessary duplications that should be consolidated, as well as orphaned components that can be removed. The overarching goal is maintaining a well-managed, transparent organizational structure as complexity increases over time through <span class="No-Break">ongoing visibility.</span></p>
			<p>In addition, some minor metadata customizations, such as reports and documents, can safely be changed directly in production, but monitoring this metadata is still required to maintain visibility and control over changes being made across environments. Even for allowable production changes, tracking who made what changes and when is critical for auditing, troubleshooting, <span class="No-Break">and governance.</span></p>
			<p>A wide range of metadata components should be monitored to maintain full visibility into customizations in a Salesforce production org. At a high level, any configurable items built on the Salesforce platform to extend functionality or tailor the system to business needs should be tracked. This spans both declarative tools accessible to admins as well as programmatic components developed <span class="No-Break">by engineers.</span></p>
			<p>Specific examples include custom objects, fields, page layouts, validation and workflow rules, Visualforce pages, Lightning components, Apex triggers and classes, permissions sets, profiles, sharing rules, and more. Monitoring should also cover clicks-not-code configurations such as approval processes, assignment rules, email templates, and flows. Higher-level changes to the overall app structure via the Lightning App Builder, Experience Builder, and Community Builder are important to capture as well. Comprehensive metadata monitoring is not limited just to business logic and end user components, but also operational settings such as authentication, integration, and security configurations. The goal is to track all custom-defined metadata so that any changes are detected to maintain transparency over the evolving shape of <span class="No-Break">production orgs.</span></p>
			<p>You can monitor production metadata using a manual or semi-automated process, which can be viable given the typically small number of production orgs in a typical environment landscape. This work can involve several tools that you can combine to suit your <span class="No-Break">particular needs:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitor deployments</strong>: From this item in <strong class="bold">Setup</strong>, you can track all the change set and metadata API deployments to <span class="No-Break">your org</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Setup audit trail</strong>: Here, you can see all the <strong class="bold">Setup</strong> changes that have been made to the org. This is usually a good starting point if you insist on a <span class="No-Break">manual process</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">SOQL queries against metadata objects</strong>: There are system objects representing different types of metadata that can be used by an admin via the <span class="No-Break">developer console</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Event Monitoring</strong>: If you have Shield, the Event Monitoring module gives you very detailed logs that can be exported and analyzed in an <span class="No-Break">analytics tool</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If the manual<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> process for monitoring seems daunting or impractical, there are a fairly large number of vendors that provide out-of-the-box solutions for this scenario, including Gearset, Panaya, Salto, <span class="No-Break">and Elements.cloud.</span></p>
			<p>Having now covered the process of monitoring metadata in production, let’s look at how to monitor metadata in our <span class="No-Break">sandbox environments.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Monitoring metadata in sandboxes</h2>
			<p>Sandboxes<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> play a<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> critical role in Salesforce development and testing workflows. The metadata that’s monitored in sandboxes depends on its <span class="No-Break">intended purpose.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Full-copy sandboxes</strong> contain <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>a replica of the production metadata <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>and data. All of the same metadata components <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>monitored in production should be tracked here as well. Full-copy sandboxes allow the production environment to be emulated accurately for rigorous testing. Changes here should only be deployed to production <span class="No-Break">after verification.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Developer and Developer Pro sandboxes</strong> only contain metadata with small data volumes. Monitoring<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> should focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>code components such as Apex, Lightning, and key configuration components to facilitate development isolated from production data. As new features are built, metadata and behavior differences from production will emerge and require alignment <span class="No-Break">before release.</span></p>
			<p>Sandbox<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> refreshes and deletions can wipe out configuration variations between environments. Ongoing metadata monitoring provides continuity through these events to maintain visibility into changes. The extent of monitoring coverage should align with the role of each sandbox. However, comprehensive visibility in both production and sandboxes is key to managing metadata seamlessly across the <span class="No-Break">org landscape.</span></p>
			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>manual methods may seem sufficient for small orgs and deployments, relying solely on ad hoc monitoring and scripts quickly becomes impractical as the Salesforce footprint grows. The diversity of metadata and configurations across sandboxes and production orgs makes manual tracking burdensome. Developers waste time piecing together changes rather than building, while admins lack visibility into the testing and <span class="No-Break">release process.</span></p>
			<p>Attempting to manually monitor metadata faces limitations at every step. Gathering metadata from multiple sandboxes and production requires repeatedly executing retrieve calls or downloads. Consolidating these results to compare across environments involves tedious parsing and analysis. Tracking changes over time forces manual versioning and change management. Even with rigorous discipline, gaps inevitably arise in capturing metadata snapshots. Source tracking via SFDX, where source changes are automatically flagged, can assist with this task and is a welcome addition to the DevOps toolkit, but when scaling, this isn’t <span class="No-Break">necessarily enough.</span></p>
			<p>Building custom scripts and tools can automate portions of metadata collection and comparison. The various Salesforce APIs provide access to metadata for retrieval. However, robustly monitoring all metadata types involves carefully orchestrating API calls across the Metadata, Tooling, and REST APIs. However, objects and components may require specialized logic. Maintaining scripts also demands ongoing development, especially as <span class="No-Break">APIs evolve.</span></p>
			<p>The complexity quickly exceeds an admin or developer’s bandwidth. The learning curve and overhead divert focus from critical tasks. Even if successful, a custom solution only automates metadata capture, not sophisticated monitoring and analytics. Edge cases will lead to blindspots in tracking metadata configurations. Instead, relying on an existing, proven third-party solution is a <span class="No-Break">smart investment.</span></p>
			<p>Purpose-built tools for metadata management are far better equipped for comprehensive <a id="_idIndexMarker447"/>monitoring. They provide out-of-the-box support for all metadata types across Salesforce APIs. Automated snapshot collection <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>and comparison powers change tracking across environments. Usage analytics identify trends and hotspots to guide optimization. Integration with <strong class="bold">integrated development environments</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDEs</strong>) and<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> release management systems enables end-to-end visibility from development <span class="No-Break">through deployment.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>A note on scratch orgs</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scratch orgs</strong> have <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>a more transient and disposable nature than sandboxes. They are spun up on demand to facilitate development or testing and then deleted once work is complete. This ephemeral life cycle means comprehensive metadata monitoring in scratch orgs provides less long-term value. The focus should be tracking changes made during short-term usage of a given scratch org instance, rather than preserving history through refresh or deletion. Lightweight change awareness helps coordinate work within a scratch org across members of a development team. However, meticulous monitoring and governance practices for scratch orgs can hinder agility. While configuring and customizing scratch orgs should not go entirely unchecked, the monitoring objective is pragmatic change visibility rather than exhaustive audit trails. The ephemeral nature of scratch orgs shifts priorities toward agility over governance compared to production and <span class="No-Break">sandbox environments.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>Monitoring data behavior</h1>
			<p>Monitoring <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>data behavior within Salesforce environments is not just a best practice, but a necessity for maintaining system health and ensuring business continuity. Therefore, it’s crucial to understand why this aspect demands as much attention as metadata monitoring. Data in Salesforce isn’t just a collection of numbers and text; it represents the real-time interaction of users and processes within your system. By closely monitoring these data changes and trends, we gain invaluable insights into the operational effectiveness and potential risks lurking within <span class="No-Break">our environments.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we will explore the multi-faceted importance of data monitoring in Salesforce. We will <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>discuss key reasons for monitoring data behavior, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The prevention of <span class="No-Break">configuration drift</span></li>
				<li>Maintaining visibility as user <span class="No-Break">needs evolve</span></li>
				<li>Identifying <span class="No-Break">optimization opportunities</span></li>
				<li>Enabling audit trails <span class="No-Break">for compliance</span></li>
				<li>Forecasting <span class="No-Break">capacity requirements</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of these elements plays a pivotal role in comprehensive environment management, ensuring that your Salesforce implementation remains robust, compliant, and aligned with your <span class="No-Break">business objectives.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>Why monitor your data?</h2>
			<p>Keeping close tabs on changes and trends in your Salesforce data is just as critical as monitoring metadata for comprehensive environment management. Metadata represents the structure and components of your implementation. However, data provides crucial visibility into how users and processes are utilizing Salesforce <span class="No-Break">in reality.</span></p>
			<p>Monitoring data alongside metadata gives a more complete picture of the environment’s state. Without monitoring data in addition to metadata, blind spots exist that can allow issues to emerge gradually <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<p>There are several<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> key reasons why data change monitoring should be <span class="No-Break">a priority:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Catch configuration drift</strong>: Salesforce configuration data like those for CPQ require oversight. Data monitoring ensures configurations remain <span class="No-Break">aligned accurately.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Maintain visibility as usage evolves</strong>: Regular data loads, ongoing usage, and changing needs cause Salesforce data to continuously evolve. Monitoring helps ensure alignment as data changes. Often, data anomalies reveal underlying issues with <span class="No-Break">the application.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identify optimization opportunities</strong>: Usage metrics reveal data access patterns to optimize indexing, storage, and more. Monitoring guides strategic optimization <span class="No-Break">like archiving.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enable audit trails</strong>: Change monitoring provides audit trails required to demonstrate compliance with data governance policies and chains <span class="No-Break">of custody.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Forecast capacity requirements</strong>: Historical growth trends help accurately project future storage needs based on how data is used <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Without monitoring, small <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>misalignments in configuration data can slowly compound over time. Settings can drift out of sync across orgs and out of compliance with governance policies. Proactive oversight prevents this by maintaining continuity and control as <span class="No-Break">configurations change.</span></p>
			<p>The volume and diversity of data can make manual inspections impractical over time. Automated ongoing monitoring provides administrators and architects with full traceability into both metadata and data. As always, this may come at <span class="No-Break">a cost.</span></p>
			<p>However, with comprehensive visibility enabling early optimization, planning, and issue resolution, environments can support growing complexity while delivering more successful business outcomes. Monitoring data alongside metadata provides a holistic view of the environment’s state, which is key to managing Salesforce implementations <span class="No-Break">at scale.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Monitoring configuration data</h2>
			<p>In addition to <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>standard business data, Salesforce orgs contain configuration data that requires just as much oversight as metadata for <span class="No-Break">environment management.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Configuration data</strong> encompasses<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> custom settings, rules, and records that control behavior in Salesforce rather than just capturing business transactions. Here are <span class="No-Break">some examples:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>CPQ quotes, products, price books, and <span class="No-Break">discount schedules</span></li>
				<li>Billing charges, subscriptions, and <span class="No-Break">payment methods</span></li>
				<li>Community membership types, moderation rules, <span class="No-Break">and themes</span></li>
				<li>Einstein recommendation settings and <span class="No-Break">usage metrics</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker457"/>configuration data<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> can be just as integral to environment stability as standard metadata. But unlike metadata, changes to configuration records are not captured in deployment logs or monitored <span class="No-Break">by default.</span></p>
			<p>Without oversight, configuration data can drift out of compliance with business rules. Critical settings may be altered that impact system behavior or contractual terms. Values can become inaccurate or outdated if they’re not kept in sync across <span class="No-Break">connected orgs.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, monitoring configuration data is essential for the <span class="No-Break">following reasons:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Maintaining alignment across environments as configuration <span class="No-Break">data changes</span></li>
				<li>Providing transparency over modifications to <span class="No-Break">critical settings</span></li>
				<li>Enabling audit trails for <span class="No-Break">compliance requirements</span></li>
				<li>Preventing unwanted <span class="No-Break">configuration drift</span></li>
				<li>Alerting on risky or <span class="No-Break">improper adjustments</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Full visibility into configuration data changes allows architects to ensure stability <span class="No-Break">and integrity.</span></p>
			<p>Certain types of configuration data may be subject to strict governance policies. For example, auditors may require reviewing all changes made to CPQ pricing and discounting rules that could affect <span class="No-Break">revenue recognition.</span></p>
			<p>Monitoring configuration data satisfies compliance needs by providing comprehensive audit trails. Queries can instantly validate that proper protocols were followed for config <span class="No-Break">record modifications.</span></p>
			<p>Without monitoring, configuration data gaps can lead to obscure errors or unchecked drift. The impacts often emerge slowly over time as small misalignments compound. Proactive oversight prevents these issues by providing continuity and control as configuration <span class="No-Break">data changes.</span></p>
			<p>While native Salesforce tools such as field history tracking provide limited insights, comprehensive monitoring requires purpose-built solutions. The diversity of configuration data demands automation for efficient collection, comparison, <span class="No-Break">and alerting.</span></p>
			<p>With the ability<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> to track configuration records alongside standard metadata, architects gain a more complete picture of the environment’s state. Monitoring configuration data closes blind spots that could otherwise<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> allow critical settings to gradually drift out of compliance. Maintaining alignment of configurations and business rules throughout your Salesforce environments is key <span class="No-Break">to stability.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Monitoring data anomalies</h2>
			<p>In addition<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> to standard business data and configuration data, monitoring for irregularities and anomalies is key for identifying potential issues early. Unusual data behaviors could signify emerging problems that <span class="No-Break">require intervention.</span></p>
			<p>Here are some common data anomalies that <span class="No-Break">warrant alerts:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sudden spikes or dips in <span class="No-Break">record volumes</span></li>
				<li>Skewed data distributions or <span class="No-Break">improbable outliers</span></li>
				<li>Bulk deletions or updates <span class="No-Break">of records</span></li>
				<li>Bottlenecks around specific records <span class="No-Break">or users</span></li>
				<li>Missing or invalid values in <span class="No-Break">certain fields</span></li>
				<li>Slow processing for particular <span class="No-Break">data types</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Watching for statistically improbable outliers reveals potential data errors such as invalid entries or integrity issues before they propagate. Inconsistent data distributions can indicate quality problems <span class="No-Break">needing remediation.</span></p>
			<p>Sudden drops in record counts or storage could represent batch deletion scripts that inadvertently wipe out important data. Transactional spikes may signal integration errors that <span class="No-Break">duplicate records.</span></p>
			<p>Performance lags when loading specific record types could indicate flawed data models needing optimization. Bottlenecks updating particular records may reveal product catalog errors impacting <span class="No-Break">order processing.</span></p>
			<p>Proactive monitoring helps surface anomalous behaviors early before they disrupt processes and decisions. Setting expected baselines aids in detecting <span class="No-Break">significant deviations.</span></p>
			<p>Tools that automatically flag irregularities against historical norms such as DynaTrace or Odaseva allow rapid triage to determine appropriate responses. Alerts empower admins to quickly identify root causes and resolve potential <span class="No-Break">data issues.</span></p>
			<p>The volume and <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>diversity of data make manual inspection for anomalies impractical. Automated solutions are necessary to baseline expected ranges and reliably <span class="No-Break">detect outliers.</span></p>
			<p>For example, monitoring data anomalies could alert on <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Case volumes exceeding the 7-day average <span class="No-Break">by 40%</span></li>
				<li>More than 10% of contact records missing phone <span class="No-Break">or email</span></li>
				<li>Nightly batch processing taking over 50% longer <span class="No-Break">than usual</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By augmenting change monitoring with automated anomaly detection, administrators can catch problems before they impact end users. Hard-to-spot data issues can be surfaced through monitoring before causing <span class="No-Break">operational disruptions.</span></p>
			<p>In Salesforce, it is often quite easy to do a level of anomaly detection with standard reports. Event Monitoring also includes some anomaly detection built in. This means that the implementation challenges associated with data monitoring can, in some cases, be less than for <span class="No-Break">metadata monitoring.</span></p>
			<p>In general, it is critical to monitor data in production environments and full-copy sandboxes. Other environments may not require the same level of scrutiny, although you may have cases where it makes sense to do more comprehensive data monitoring, even in <span class="No-Break">lower environments.</span></p>
			<p>Handling incidents revealed through anomaly alerts may require collaboration across teams. However, identifying and resolving problems early helps maintain data integrity <span class="No-Break">and health.</span></p>
			<p>Watching for unusual data behaviors provides unique visibility that’s unattainable through metadata monitoring alone. Combined with change tracking, anomaly detection produces a more complete view of the Salesforce <span class="No-Break">environment state.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Monitoring data quality</h2>
			<p>In addition <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>to tracking changes and anomalies, monitoring <strong class="bold">Salesforce data quality</strong> is important for maintaining the fidelity and integrity of environments. Data quality is a big topic, much of which is not directly relevant to monitoring for changes. Therefore, we will only cover a <span class="No-Break">sliver here.</span></p>
			<p>Allowing data quality issues to accumulate over time without oversight puts environment stability at risk. Some common data quality dimensions to monitor include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Completeness</strong>: Missing values in <span class="No-Break">required fields</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Validity</strong>: Improper data formats or <span class="No-Break">invalid entries</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accuracy</strong>: Incorrect or <span class="No-Break">outdated values</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Consistency</strong>: Contradictions across <span class="No-Break">related records</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Low data quality can lead to several compounding issues, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Processing failures from invalid data, which may directly <span class="No-Break">impact deployment</span></li>
				<li>Difficulty reporting on <span class="No-Break">incomplete records</span></li>
				<li>Bad decisions due to <span class="No-Break">inaccurate information</span></li>
				<li>Declining trust in data by <span class="No-Break">business users</span></li>
				<li>Poor performance in reports <span class="No-Break">or queries</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Dedicated monitoring ensures data quality assurance is a part of ongoing operations. Data issues can be quickly detected and resolved as they emerge rather than after <span class="No-Break">the fact.</span></p>
			<p>For example, monitoring could alert if more than 5% of records in an object are missing essential fields such as phone, address, or correct owner. Failing to meet completeness thresholds triggers <span class="No-Break">corrective processes.</span></p>
			<p>Continuously tracking key quality metrics highlights areas needing improvement. Data stewards can be notified automatically to implement fixes and optimize <span class="No-Break">entry workflows.</span></p>
			<p>The Salesforce Labs Data Quality Dashboards provide a free starting point for monitoring key quality metrics across standard and custom objects. Architects can also build custom-quality dashboards suited to their <span class="No-Break">specific needs.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Monitoring data volumes</h2>
			<p>Tracking <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>storage consumption, record counts, and transaction volumes provides key insights into data growth trends over time. Historical metrics enable accurately forecasting infrastructure needs and licensing costs as data expands. Noticing surges in volume can also reveal potential processing issues worth investigating. Though simple, monitoring key volume metrics provides critical visibility that guides optimization <span class="No-Break">and planning.</span></p>
			<p>Salesforce provides native functionality to view current storage usage across your org, down to the per-user and per-record type level. From <strong class="bold">Setup</strong>, administrators can access storage usage reports showing available and used data space, top users by utilization, and largest files. Clicking on a user reveals a breakdown of their stored data by <span class="No-Break">record type.</span></p>
			<p>Storage totals are calculated asynchronously, so usage may not update immediately after large imports or file uploads. Individual users can also view personal storage utilization details in their <span class="No-Break">account information.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we delved into key areas such as the prevention of configuration drift, maintaining visibility as user needs evolve, identifying optimization opportunities, enabling audit trails for compliance, and forecasting capacity requirements. These insights are not only critical for ensuring the operational effectiveness of your Salesforce system but also play a pivotal role in aligning it with your business objectives. Now, let’s summarize what <span class="No-Break">we’ve learned.</span></p>
