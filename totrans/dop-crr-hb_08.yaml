- en: Leading a DevOps team had been my goal since starting a career in DevOps at
    *United Health Group*. My mentor helped surface the shortcomings that needed to
    be addressed if my goal was to become a reality. Presenting and demonstrating
    ideas to others had always been a struggle; also, being very timid and not great
    at voicing my opinion were all deficiencies I was unaware of until I had a candid
    goal-setting discussion with my mentor.

- en: The solution to overcome my shortcomings was transitioning from a behind-the-scenes
    technical individual to a coaching role. A technical coach's role was to help
    agile teams learn and adapt CICD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery)best
    practices; in other words, a lot of demonstrating and voicing my opinion was going
    to be required.

  zh: 克服我短板的解决方案是从幕后技术人员转变为教练角色。技术教练的角色是帮助敏捷团队学习并适应 CICD（持续集成与持续交付）最佳实践；换句话说，需要大量的演示和发表我的意见。
- en: The first portion of my transition included being immersed in the world of agile,
    along with having 1:1 coaching sessions with my mentor. One of my first teams
    I was assisting was not using a CI server, had not migrated their code into GitHub,
    and had no automated tests or regression tests in place. These were things I was
    comfortable doing in my sleep; however, my role was not doing the work but instead
    coaching and guiding the team in the correct direction. It was terrible; however,
    slowly over the course of the first sprint, I started becoming more comfortable
    with myself and the team. It became quite fun, and also, my mentor and supervisor
    told me I was quite good at it.

  zh: 我的转型过程的第一部分包括沉浸在敏捷的世界中，并与我的导师进行一对一的辅导会议。我协助的第一个团队没有使用 CI 服务器，代码没有迁移到 GitHub，也没有自动化测试或回归测试。这些都是我熟悉的事情；然而，我的角色并不是做这些工作，而是指导和引导团队走向正确的方向。那段时间非常糟糕；然而，在第一个冲刺的过程中，我开始变得越来越舒适，无论是对自己还是对团队。慢慢地，这变得相当有趣，我的导师和主管也告诉我，我做得相当不错。
- en: My journey as a technical coach lasted for two years before transitioning into
    leading the DevOps **Center of Excellence** (**COE**). It wasn't until much later
    that my goal to become a people manager of a DevOps team become a reality. Without
    the direction of my mentor, I likely would not have developed the skills that
    I needed to lead a team, nor would I have discovered the passion I had for coaching
    and training, which was a direction I, ultimately, decided to pursue further.
