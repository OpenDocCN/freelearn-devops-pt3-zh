    will help you ensure your goals are achievable, using milestones. The following
    is a true story of how my mentor helped to lead me down a path unrelated to my
    goal, which ended up being exactly what I needed to succeed.

- en: Leading a DevOps team had been my goal since starting a career in DevOps at
    *United Health Group*. My mentor helped surface the shortcomings that needed to
    be addressed if my goal was to become a reality. Presenting and demonstrating
    ideas to others had always been a struggle; also, being very timid and not great
    at voicing my opinion were all deficiencies I was unaware of until I had a candid
    goal-setting discussion with my mentor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solution to overcome my shortcomings was transitioning from a behind-the-scenes
    technical individual to a coaching role. A technical coach's role was to help
    agile teams learn and adapt CICD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery)best
    practices; in other words, a lot of demonstrating and voicing my opinion was going
    to be required.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first portion of my transition included being immersed in the world of agile,
    along with having 1:1 coaching sessions with my mentor. One of my first teams
    I was assisting was not using a CI server, had not migrated their code into GitHub,
    and had no automated tests or regression tests in place. These were things I was
    comfortable doing in my sleep; however, my role was not doing the work but instead
    coaching and guiding the team in the correct direction. It was terrible; however,
    slowly over the course of the first sprint, I started becoming more comfortable
    with myself and the team. It became quite fun, and also, my mentor and supervisor
    told me I was quite good at it.
  prefs: []

- en: My journey as a technical coach lasted for two years before transitioning into
    leading the DevOps **Center of Excellence** (**COE**). It wasn't until much later
    that my goal to become a people manager of a DevOps team become a reality. Without
    the direction of my mentor, I likely would not have developed the skills that
    I needed to lead a team, nor would I have discovered the passion I had for coaching
    and training, which was a direction I, ultimately, decided to pursue further.

    on your own. Before making any career-altering goals or changes, I encourage discussions

    that is, a relationship in which you feel comfortable discussing your doubts.

    require for the role? If you asked your mentor to be a reference for a specific
    role and they have agreed, you can assume they are confident in your abilities
    for the role and use them as a reference. On the other hand, if you asked your
    mentor whether you could use them as a reference in general, not for a specific
    role, you will need to access their confidence in your abilities for the role.
    The best option would be to discuss the specific role with your mentor and get
    their feedback on it.'

    three stages of a mentor-mentee relationship. Stage 1 is where you have not officially
    asked someone to be your mentor, stage 2 is where you officially define the relationship
    and begin having official 1:1 sessions, and in stage 3, your relationship grows
    due to an increase in trust and respect for one another. It is at stage 3 where
    you are able to begin having more productive and fruitful discussions.
