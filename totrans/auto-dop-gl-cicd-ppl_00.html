			<p>Organizations in recent years have recognized the benefits of more collaborative and iterative approaches to software development. The traditional model, where development and operations teams worked in silos, made it difficult for companies to quickly and reliably deliver new features. The adoption of DevOps has addressed these challenges by promoting integration and communication between development and operations. The additional proliferation of tooling and automated workflows have helped improve software quality <span class="No-Break">and stability.</span></p>
			<p>A key element of DevOps is continuous integration and continuous delivery (or deployment) (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>). CI/CD is the practice of regularly integrating developer contributions into a shared repository, and then automatically building, testing, and releasing the application. The goal is to minimize the cycle time required to deploy software updates, as well as reduce human error during <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></p>
			<p>This book presents and teaches GitLab as a unified DevOps platform for managing the stages of the software development life cycle. The content will focus primarily on concepts and examples, without locking you into feature capabilities and UI workflows that will likely change over time. After completing this book, you will be equipped to use GitLab to manage almost any software project, while also learning about the best practices that can be applied across other DevOps workflows and <span class="No-Break">CI/CD tools.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is intended for anyone involved in the software development life cycle with software projects of any size. If that sounds broad, that’s because it is! GitLab has something to offer people in a huge variety of roles. Traditional GitLab users include developers, QA, security testers, performance testers, product owners, project managers, UX designers, technical writers, release engineers, and the broad range of roles that fall under the amorphous terms of “DevOps” and “DevSecOps.” So if you find yourself involved with planning, writing, testing, securing, building, packaging, or deploying software, or managing any of those tasks, and you’re wondering how to automate any of the slow, error-prone tasks that you currently perform manually, this book will almost certainly give you ideas about how to improve your life using GitLab and its automated <span class="No-Break">CI/CD pipelines.</span></p>
			<p>This book assumes no prior knowledge other than some familiarity with one or more of the major stages of the software development life cycle. We expect every reader will be involved with different parts of the life cycle, so will focus on the parts of the book that are most relevant to them. That’s a perfectly good way to approach this book, although we recommend everyone read the four chapters that make up the first section since they explain background concepts and terminology that are required knowledge for all <span class="No-Break">GitLab users.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You will get the most out of this book if you have an account on a GitLab instance, whether on <a href="http://gitlab.com">gitlab.com</a> (that is, a software-as-a-service instance) or on a self-hosted instance. It will also be useful to have access to a Linux, macOS, or Windows terminal with Git installed. Some familiarity with the major stages of the software development life cycle will be helpful as well. No programming knowledge is assumed, but some experience with YML or other structured data formats will make many parts of the book easier <span class="No-Break">to follow.</span></p>
			<p>The code examples in this book were tested with GitLab version 15.x. They should work with future versions as well. All screenshots are also taken from GitLab version 15.x. Future versions are likely to introduce some drift in the GUI, but the fundamental concepts and operations should remain <span class="No-Break">the same.</span></p>
