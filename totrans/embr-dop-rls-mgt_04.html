<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">A conventional IT organization has extremely long development cycles by today’s standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">In these antiquated companies, capacious amounts of manual testing must usually occur prior to a software product being released to production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">What’s more, any time there’s a code change, it can cause a remarkable amount of stress on the stakeholders involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">While working in organizations such as these, development teams typically wait for clean environments to be provisioned or they must wait for approval prior to making any changes at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.5">Additionally, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">quality assurance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">QA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">) teams might be waiting</span><a id="_idIndexMarker183"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1"> for developers to finish</span><a id="_idIndexMarker184"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> their work before</span><a id="_idIndexMarker185"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1"> it is ready for testing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">All of this waiting results in low </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">deployment frequency</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">DF</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">) and high </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">lead time for </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">changes</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1"> (</span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">LTFC</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Furthermore, in traditional IT organizations, many team members drop off after a project is finished, leaving little documentation behind and zero knowledge transfer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">This makes things challenging when new engineers join the team and attempt to support the systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">Usually, this leads to a higher </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">mean time to recovery</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">MTTR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">) when critical issues</span><a id="_idIndexMarker186"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1"> occur. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Many organizations such as these manage the configuration of their environments with a dedicated operations team, whose sole focus is on infrastructure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">They will commonly pursue manual changes to their</span><a id="_idIndexMarker187"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1"> servers, resulting in configuration drift, even if </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Infrastructure-as-Code</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">IaC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">) is the standard company procedure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Servers across environments may end up with different artifacts, such as required libraries needed for applications or different patch levels of the same product. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">All of this manual work results in low DF, with high </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">lead times.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">In this chapter, we will discern how DevOps release management addresses these concerns by incorporating automation, minimizing risk, streamlining releases, and measuring success</span><a id="_idIndexMarker188"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1"> by tracking metrics and analyzing </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">key performance indicators</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">KPIs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">We are making a case for why the qualities of DevOps differentiate it as a superior release management methodology, particularly in the context of cloud-based </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">microservice deployments.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">When it comes to the creation</span><a id="_idIndexMarker189"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1"> of software, most modern organizations</span><a id="_idIndexMarker190"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> must contend</span><a id="_idIndexMarker191"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> with a couple of significant obstacles: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">deploying software quickly</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">innovating at scale</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">The DevOps approach aims to address</span><a id="_idIndexMarker192"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> these challenges by implementing automation across the whole </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">software development life cycle</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">SDLC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">), with the goal of expediting the delivery of software that is both dependable </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">and secure.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">By merging automated testing, automated deployment, and automated change management, DevOps release management paves the way for operations teams to automate release planning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">It is considerably simpler to manage and deliver successful releases when using automation since it makes release management an easily reproducible, repeatable process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">This is achieved</span><a id="_idIndexMarker193"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> by implementing well-crafted </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">continuous integration/continuous deployment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">CI/CD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">) pipelines that are interoperable throughout your organization, but it is just as important that they </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">are dependable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">There is no denying how complex it can be to automate a DevOps framework that features continuous release and CD. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Throughout the whole application development process, it is necessary to use a combination of thorough testing, extensive cross-team communication, cutting-edge tooling, and workflow procedures to make continuous releases a reality in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">your organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">In the following subsection, we will discuss the all-important topic of automated testing, which is the lifeblood of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">DevOps philosophy.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Automated testing</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Deploying automated tests</span><a id="_idIndexMarker194"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1"> as early and often as possible within a CI/CD pipeline has been a founding feature of DevOps from its very inception. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">This includes proactively monitoring the production environment for potential issues that would negatively impact users if left unchecked. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">The reality is that contemporary applications rely on numerous artifacts and services with multiple points of failure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">In addition to using static and dynamic application analysis tools in pipelines, it is pertinent that you perform transactional monitoring in all development environments, not just production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">Do this by running tests with mock data and continuous monitoring; this way, you can detect issues that affect</span><a id="_idIndexMarker195"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1"> any component of your application, including third-party </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Software-as-a-Service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">SaaS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">) integrations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">Some effective SaaS tools that facilitate this include Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Snyk, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Prisma Cloud.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">As your development teams refine their DevOps practices, they’ll want to implement test automation across the entire SDLC, as this is key to unlocking the full benefits of DevOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">These benefits include the ability to build, test, and release faster and more consistently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">To improve </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">incident response</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">IR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">) encourage cooperation, and communicate</span><a id="_idIndexMarker196"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1"> effectively across teams, it is no longer viable to subject new code to hours or even days of manual QA testing before the software developers receive feedback about their work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">QA teams must align their efforts around the DevOps release management life cycle by ensuring that test cases are automated and that they feature complete code coverage, where attainable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">The configuration of environments needs to be standardized through the use of IaC and deployments should be provisioned automatically and immutably. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.4">Put another way, any pre-testing duties, such as infrastructure provisioning, environment configuration, post-testing tasks, cleanups, or related, repeatable, and mundane items should all be automated, aligning with the philosophy </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">of CI.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Automated testing is the key advantage of CI, which conserves your resources so that you can attain economies of scale. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">To begin with, automated testing maximizes the likelihood that errors will be caught before they make it into production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">It also speeds up the release process by notifying you of bugs and defects as soon as they are detected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.4">Furthermore, a significant advantage of implementing CI is the potential for smaller teams to successfully perform heavier lifts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.5">Concurrent integration allows you to execute multiple automated tests in rapid succession, commonly finished within only a few minutes each, which further reduces your testing expenditures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.6">It may seem overwhelming to automate your entire development process, but you can start small by automating a single end-to-end process and running it on a regular basis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.7">New tools and resources make automated testing more approachable than ever, and the benefits justify the expense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.8">Automated testing empowers you to eliminate bottlenecks and boost productivity, which usually increases employee and customer happiness, as well as the revenue being deposited in your company’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">bank account.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">One significant tailwind that results from automated testing is the ability to scale operations at the speed of today’s contemporary digital marketplace. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">DevOps techniques have a track record of producing consistent quality with reduced risk. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">This is accomplished, in part, by distributing work across multiple small teams that operate in a self-sufficient manner yet will socialize as a cohesive tribe. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">This communal development style encourages sharing individual techniques and ideas</span><a id="_idIndexMarker197"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1"> among team members while instilling a common philosophy as a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">business unit</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">BU</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">Because of the massive gains in productivity that result from automated testing, you will experience far better team collaboration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">Your colleagues will not have to devote as much of their time and effort toiling over manual testing protocols. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">Instead, teams will have more opportunities for discussing optimization strategies or going out for fraternal lunches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.5">Because you chose to adopt the DevOps culture, you have chosen shared responsibility for quality that instills a sense of pride among team members. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.6">By now, you can see that automated testing is a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">DevOps mainstay.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">DevOps release management can help you gain greater reliability with your infrastructure and business processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">What’s more, when you improve the reliability of releases by increasing test automation</span><a id="_idIndexMarker198"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1"> coverage, issues in production will become a rare occurrence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">The sum of these attributes results in an empowering working environment that colleagues enjoy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.3">All of these hallmarks of the DevOps release management methodology result in increased customer happiness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.4">It is a proven fact that better reliability and prompt responses to customer feedback boost satisfaction and encourage more people to recommend your company’s products </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">to others.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">Automating deployment</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">At its core, CD is a unified release</span><a id="_idIndexMarker199"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1"> process that incorporates automated</span><a id="_idIndexMarker200"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1"> build, test, and deployment steps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">The objective is to streamline operations involved with pushing new software into production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">Each business must figure out what mix of unit, functional, and stress tests make up its own unique suite of tests. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.4">To successfully stage and test builds and release candidates, it is essential that you simulate production environment conditions in pre-production test infrastructure prior </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">to launch.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">Code changes can be pushed to production automatically with the use of a CD pipeline, which is just an automated workflow combining builds, tests, and deployments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">An output from one workflow phase becomes an input for the following workflow phase, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">With a DevOps approach, errors, functional difficulties, and defects can be prevented with CD, thanks to automated testing and monitoring performed at every stage of the process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.4">By working in this way, any problems that might otherwise land in the main branch are caught before they ever </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">reach production.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">The final outcome is that engineering teams have the ability to implement code modifications to the primary branch and promptly see their deployment in the production environment, typically within a matter of minutes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">This particular philosophy of software development emphasizes the fundamental objective of DevOps, which is to continuously deliver value to end users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">This factor also serves as a primary catalyst for the introduction of new features and system modifications in numerous applications and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">web-based services.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">Once in place, CD enables enterprises to more easily meet customer expectations and release software upgrades quickly, typically within minutes after submitting code changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">However, adopting CD can be a huge change from the traditional method of spending days or even weeks getting ready to distribute software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">Nevertheless, companies who put in the necessary effort, money, and equipment reap tangible benefits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.4">The following are examples of some widely recognized benefits of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">adopting CD:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">The implementation of entirely automated product rollouts</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">: This empowers enterprises</span><a id="_idIndexMarker201"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1"> to allocate additional time toward software development rather than interrupting development activities in anticipation of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">release day.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">There should be more frequent, smaller releases</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">: This not only makes product development work go more quickly but also helps support a paradigm of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">continuous improvement.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">There are rapid feedback loops related to newly implemented functionality</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">: Organizations have the ability to promptly receive real-time feedback regarding novel features, upgrades, and modifications </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">to code.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">Automating change management</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">One legacy process that greatly</span><a id="_idIndexMarker202"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1"> benefits from the special touch of DevOps methods is change management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">Many existing approaches to change management directly contradict the foundational tenets of the DevOps philosophy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.3">Longer release cycles and delays in providing value to the client are virtually guaranteed by the bureaucracy and gates introduced by traditional strategies, which require numerous levels of permission for every change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.4">This runs counter to the DevOps philosophy, which emphasizes fast iteration and frequent customer benefit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.5">To effectively implement a DevOps strategy for managing changes, we must abandon our traditional, insular focus on maintaining stability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.6">To fully grasp how change management can facilitate rapid response and adaptability while maintaining consistency, we must extend our lens. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.7">We don’t utilize the change approval process as roadblocks to slow down innovation, but rather as part of a process to speed up the delivery of new features to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">our customers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">Commonly, you will engage with organizations that employ CI/CD methodologies, enabling them to conduct numerous releases on a daily basis, sometimes reaching double-digit or even triple-digit figures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">To effectively implement change management at a rapid speed, it is imperative</span><a id="_idIndexMarker203"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1"> to incorporate it into CI/CD processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">There are several </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">IT service management</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">ITSM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">) tools, such as ServiceNow, Jira, Freshservice, and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker204"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1"> Zendesk, that provide an </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">application programming interface</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">API</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">), enabling seamless integration between your CD pipeline and your change management system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">By utilizing these APIs, organizations have the capability to automatically generate change tickets and notify relevant parties involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.3">This practice guarantees the availability of a ticket for each modification without imposing any additional strain or impeding the deployment process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.4">Numerous businesses have successfully facilitated the convergence of process structure, collaborative culture, and change management tooling, paving the way to achieving stable </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">operating environments.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">Adding audit trails to a pipeline is a simple thing to do and results in significant advantages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">After implementing audit trails, anyone who is interested can find out how much time was spent for a recent modification to go live, why it was necessary, who gave their approval for it, and whether or not all checkmarks in the preceding phases were marked off. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.3">For instance, when an auditor demands documentation that a change followed your procedure in the future, all that will be required of you is to trace the log trails backward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.4">You can configure fine-grained access to all of the information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.5">However, along with these advantages come significant challenges. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.6">This is especially true in situations that require bypassing change management gates in order to commit manual changes in a production environment during an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">emergency situation.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">The typical implementation of the DevOps release management approach involves established methodologies such as CI/CD and deployment automation, substantially expediting the development of high-quality software while mitigating potential risks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">Consequently, these factors enable enterprises to promptly adapt to market fluctuations and meet consumer demands with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">greater efficiency.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">Among the several areas where DevOps practices</span><a id="_idIndexMarker214"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1"> have proven to be particularly useful is </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">disaster recovery</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">DR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">Automating processes, implementing CI/CD, and taking advantage of cloud computing are crucial to guaranteeing 99.999% uptime, and with no data loss. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.3">When DR planning becomes part of an organization’s DevOps pipeline strategy, it is often managed alongside the application itself, such that the changes to both get vetted on a regular basis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.4">By including DR planning in the DevOps workflow, the recovery process is effectively transformed into a process similar to deploying an application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.5">In addition to reducing the likelihood of mistakes, this also helps expedite the release of new software applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.6">In the event of a crisis, your team can leverage their expertise in deployment to facilitate the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">recovery process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">Additionally, DR environments that replicate data can contribute to recovery efforts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">Without a doubt, the tools and procedures used to move applications from development, to QA, and onto production can also be applied to failing over and recovering from disasters or service interruptions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.3">This ensures that by choosing to adopt DevOps, you will have made a worthwhile investment from a DR perspective as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.4">The bottom line: the same automated technologies employed for transitioning applications between development/testing and production environments can be utilized for failover and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">recovery purposes.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">By incorporating release management</span><a id="_idIndexMarker217"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1"> into existing DevOps workflows, the release process can be simplified and eventually standardized. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">It establishes a precedent for company procedures to be repeated in a uniform way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.3">It is advised that you record your CI/CD pipeline results in a release log and aggregate them into your release management issue tracking products, source control management, and related tooling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.4">After a system has been deployed, this documentation is essential for tracing the origins of issues and applying </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">appropriate solutions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">The term </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">release pipeline</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1"> refers to the collection of automated</span><a id="_idIndexMarker218"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1"> and manual processes used to guarantee that customers have access to a stable and safe build of a company’s software product. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">The duties and responsibilities of a release pipeline are to ensure that product enhancements are quickly and safely delivered to end users, beginning with changes to source code that are driven through development, testing, and release. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">Continuous delivery</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">CD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">), the process of making sure your code</span><a id="_idIndexMarker219"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1"> base can be safely deployed at any moment, works hand in hand with release pipelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">The reason for this is that they lessen the amount of time that developers must spend on tedious work or correcting inevitable bugs that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">crop up.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">The most significant advantage</span><a id="_idIndexMarker220"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1"> of a release pipeline is that it will shorten the time required to deliver a new release while still guaranteeing stability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">In case something goes wrong, you’ll have automatic rollback procedures and fail-safes in place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">Overall, your users will have access to new features (or bug fixes) sooner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.4">Predictability and dependability are both improved through release pipelines, and increased developer productivity is another advantage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.5">Developers can avoid wasting time justifying their actions or refactoring releases after the fact due to built-in audit features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.6">They will have more time to devote to writing code (the activity that provides value to the business) and less time to worry about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">peripheral details.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">A release pipeline acts as the orchestrator of your company’s software distribution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">This implies that the system will automatically make decisions using inputs and data obtained from the release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">Further, it will address frequent problems in real time or, in some cases, instantly revert the deployment if it identifies any adverse effects on customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.4">The release pipeline is tailored to the unique requirements and administrative framework of your business’s operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.5">The tool has the capability to offer comprehensive feedback and valuable metrics, enhancing the overall awareness of the entire release process; this type of visibility is not attainable by any </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">alternative means.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">The implementation of orchestrated release pipelines facilitates the ability to accurately forecast the results of projects and ultimately validate their achievements or shortcomings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">Operations teams, which are frequently evaluated based on release velocity, efficiency, and effectiveness, can also benefit from release pipelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.3">Quicker than scripted deployments and less taxing on resources, release pipelines are becoming increasingly popular. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.4">This is because they reduce risk and incorporate automatic corrective procedures for when things go wrong, relieving operations teams of the most intractable and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">mundane vexations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">This ends our glimpse at how DevOps</span><a id="_idIndexMarker221"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1"> release management can streamline the release process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">In the following section, you’ll see how to quantitatively measure your success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.3">This can be used to verify that your processes are improving and to demonstrate value to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">senior executives.</span></span></p>
