     The first part describes an anti-pattern related to information control.

     Third, we examine an anti-pattern specifically concerning the way you create architectural artifacts.

     Others would prefer dealing with a dedicated vendor with a more retail-focused attitude.

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">
     In the meantime, there are many other smaller technical tasks to get on with, so Rainer focuses on these, leaving the new order management system as a generic capability on diagrams, presentations, and documentation.

      While it has some good functionality, it does not, in Rainer’s assessment, begin to meet the real needs of

     The sales team had a complex quote-to-order process that involved multiple approvals and specific regulatory compliance checks.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.2">
     Sarah, the sales operations manager, tried repeatedly to schedule meetings with Marcus’s team to walk through their current process and explain their requirements in detail.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.3">
     However, Marcus had valid concerns about replicating overly complex legacy processes in Salesforce.

     During the initial requirements gathering, Sarah expressed concerns about certain compliance checks that needed to happen before quotes could be sent to customers.

     She explained that their current process required cross-referencing multiple databases to ensure they weren’t selling restricted medical supplies to unlicensed facilities.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.3">
     Marcus believed that Salesforce’s validation rules and approval processes could streamline these checks significantly, eliminating what he saw as redundant steps in the

     They were proud of how they leveraged platform features and kept customization to a minimum, which would make the system easier to maintain and upgrade.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.3">
     When Sarah pointed out that the solution didn’t account for their need to maintain detailed audit trails of all compliance checks, Marcus insisted that Salesforce’s standard history tracking would be sufficient, arguing against building custom audit functionality that would require

     The compliance team discovered they couldn’t perform all necessary checks within the system.
    </span>

     Within the first week, two major problems emerged.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.3">
     First, sales reps were taking twice as long to process quotes because the system forced them into a workflow that didn’t match their needs.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">
     The problem manifests through failure to map dependencies across the complex ecosystem of modern Salesforce organizations, where seemingly isolated components are often deeply interconnected through automation, integrations, and reporting relationships.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.2">
     Teams frequently conduct only surface-level reviews of proposed changes, missing critical dependencies and downstream effects.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.3">
     Testing often focuses only on the immediate functionality being changed, rather than the entire chain of affected systems and processes.
