			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Chapter 2</em>: Plan, Track, and Visualize Your Work</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, you learned how to measure engineering velocity and performance to make your acceleration visible and change the conversation with management.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will focus on organizing your work inside your team and applying <strong class="bold">Lean principles</strong>. You’ll learn how GitHub issues and projects can help you simplify the flow of your work. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Work is work</li>
				<li>Unplanned work and rework</li>
				<li>Visualizing your work</li>
				<li>Limiting WIP</li>
				<li>GitHub issues, labels, and milestones</li>
				<li>GitHub projects</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Work is work</h1>
			<p>Work is an<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> activity done in order to achieve a purpose or result. This not only includes the product or project you are working on but also all activities you have to perform for your company. In some teams I work with, there are people that spend up to 50% of their work time on tasks outside their project/product team. Some are team leads and have meetings and responsibilities with their organizational team members. Some are part of the working council. Some have training for personal development paths. Some just have to <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>fix bugs and live-site issues for projects they had worked on in the past.</p>
			<p>Many of these tasks cannot be taken away from the team members. The team member may like them or not – but often they are an important part of their personal development.</p>
			<p>The problem with<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> this kind of work is that the prioritization and coordination of these tasks are done by the individuals and outside their team context. Who decides whether working on a bug of a previous system the developer worked on should be prioritized over a bug in the current project? Normally, the individuals plan and prioritize the work on their own. This often leads to more planning upfront. When team members report their available times at the beginning of a sprint, the team starts to plan their current tasks <em class="italic">around</em> these events. This can prevent the entire team from <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>establishing <strong class="bold">pull</strong> and forces<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> them to plan the dependent tasks and assign them to individual team members (<strong class="bold">push</strong>).</p>
			<p>To address this, you should make all work visible to the team and add it to the team backlog. Are you in a working council? Add it to the backlog. Do you have training? Add it to the backlog.</p>
			<p>So, the first step is to figure out <em class="italic">what kind of work is performed by your team</em> and gather everything in <strong class="bold">one backlog</strong>.</p>
			<p>The second step is to <strong class="bold">simplify</strong>. Everyone can make things more complicated – but it takes a touch of genius to make things simpler. That’s why in most companies, processes and forms get more complicated over the years. I’ve seen forms with 300 fields on them and complicated routing rules based on these fields – just to handle live-site incidents. Don’t transfer this to your backlog. Independent of the process in the background – the work has a clear trigger for your team, is processed by your team, and then leaves your responsibility – so from your perspective it is done. One process or ticket could lead to multiple small work items in your backlog. Every <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>work item should be<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> simplified<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> to <strong class="bold">To Do</strong>, <strong class="bold">Doing</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In <a href="B17827_18_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor356"><em class="italic">Chapter 18</em></a>, <em class="italic">Lean Product Development and Lean Startup</em>, we’ll focus more on value streams, the theory of constraints, and how to optimize the flow of work. In this chapter, we’ll focus on the team level and how you get started to optimize later across team boundaries.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Unplanned work and rework</h1>
			<p>All<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> developers know that <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>frequent <strong class="bold">context switching</strong> leads to less productivity. If we are disturbed while coding, it takes us some time to get back into the code and continue with the same productivity we had when the disturbance occurred. So, working on multiple projects or tasks also reduces productivity. In his book <em class="italic">Quality Software Management: Systems Thinking</em>, Gerald M. Weinberg presents the result of a study that concludes that when only working on two projects simultaneously, the performance drops by about 20% (Weinberg G.M. 1991). For each project you add, the performance drops 20% further (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.1</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer016" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_001.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Loss of productivity when context switching&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – Loss of productivity when context switching</p>
			<p>Another study<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> from 2017 shows that developers who work on two or three projects spend on average 17% of their effort on context switching (Tregubov A., Rodchenko N., Boehm B., &amp; Lane J.A., 2017). I think the actual percentage may vary a lot from product to product and from team to team. Developers who work in small batch sizes can switch context easier than others that work in bigger batch sizes. The more complex the matter is, the more effort it requires to pick up work where you left it. Practices such as <strong class="bold">Test-Driven Development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>) help<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> you to pick up work easier after context switching.</p>
			<p>But independent of the actual percentage: context switching kills productivity and the more focus time developers spend on one task, the more efficient they are. This means you should reduce the <strong class="bold">Work in Progress</strong> (<strong class="bold">WIP</strong>) for<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> the team – especially unplanned work and rework.</p>
			<p>To help you<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> optimize later, you should label your work items correctly from the beginning. Unplanned work<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> can originate from within your project or outside. Rework can<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> occur if there is a bug, technical debt, or a misunderstood requirement. Make sure you can analyze your work later by applying the correct labels from the beginning. This should not be a complicated governance framework – just pick some labels that will help you later to optimize your work. <em class="italic">Table 2.1</em> is just an example of how you could classify your work items:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Table_011.jpg" alt="Table 2.1 – Example taxonomy for your work items&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Table 2.1 – Example taxonomy for your work items</p>
			<p>Keep it simple and select a taxonomy with simple wording that is clear to your team.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Visualizing your work</h1>
			<p>To focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>the important work and reduce multitasking and task switching, you should visualize your work – typically in the form <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>of a <strong class="bold">Kanban</strong> board. Kanban has its <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>roots in <strong class="bold">Lean manufacturing</strong> but is now considered an important part of <strong class="bold">Lean software development</strong>. Kanban <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>can help you improve the efficiency of the flow of work through your system.</p>
			<p>The visualization<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> will help you to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify bottlenecks, wait times, and hand-offs.</li>
				<li>Prioritize work and work on the most important tasks first.</li>
				<li>Break down work into small batch sizes.</li>
				<li>Get things done.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Establish pull</h2>
			<p>No plan is perfect. If you have<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> ever planned a project, you know the project plan only works with a lot of buffer time – and yet you must always adjust the plan. So, even if you only plan your work for the upcoming 2 or 3 weeks, planning will lead to wait time and context switching. The solution is to stop planning and establish a pull system; team members pull the work with the highest priority from the queue and work on it. Ideally, the task is finished and moved to Done (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em>):</p>
			<p><img src="image/B17827_02_002.png" alt="Figure 2.2 – Pulling work from the backlog to indicate a status change&#13;&#10;"/></p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Pulling work from the backlog to indicate a status change</p>
			<p>If your task cannot be finished with just you working on it, this might be an indicator that the task is too big <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>and needs to be split into smaller tasks. If you must work on many tasks simultaneously to get anything done, the tasks might be too small. This will adjust over time as the visual representation helps you to spot bottlenecks and wait time.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Prioritize</h2>
			<p>The benefit of <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>working with visual boards is that it is easy to prioritize your work. Just move work items with the highest priority to the top. If you have different kinds of work on the board, you might want an additional visual separation. This can be done with <strong class="bold">swimlanes</strong>. A swimlane is a horizontal grouping of work on the Kanban board (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.3</em>):</p>
			<p><img src="image/B17827_02_003.png" alt="Figure 2.3 – Using swimlanes to organize your work on the board&#13;&#10;"/></p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – Using swimlanes to organize your work on the board</p>
			<p>If your team has to work on live site issues, you might want a priority swimlane that signals to all team members that a current issue has priority over normal work. Or if your team members have responsibilities outside the team, you also want to separate this from your normal work.</p>
			<p>Many Kanban boards also allow you to set a different color for each card – normally by applying a label or tag to the card. This can also help you to visually distinguish different kinds of work on the board. Especially when combined with swimlanes, colored cards can help you to see at a first glance how the team is doing and what the most important tasks are that need attention.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Keep it simple!</h2>
			<p>Start small<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> with three columns (To Do, Doing, and Done) and<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> add more columns and swimlanes if needed to<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> optimize the flow for your team. But be careful to keep it simple! Ask yourself before every customization: is this necessary? Does this bring value? Is there a simpler way?</p>
			<p>Complicated things have the tendency to stick – when moving to Kanban boards, I’ve seen teams grow their board to a monster with 10 columns, 8 swimlanes (most of them collapsed all the time), and many fields and information on the cards.</p>
			<p>Kanban is about simplification – try to keep it as simple as possible!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Limiting WIP</h1>
			<p>One of the goals <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>of Kanban is to limit WIP. With less WIP, you have less context switching and more focus. This helps you to get things done! Stop starting and start finishing!</p>
			<p>Even when coaching Scrum teams, I’ve seen teams that start to work on all the user stories they had planned during the first days of the sprint. Every time a developer was blocked, they just started to work on another story. At the end of the sprint, all stories had been worked on, but none was finished.</p>
			<p>In Kanban, you work on a small number of items – and in a constant pace.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Set WIP limits</h2>
			<p>Most Kanban boards support WIP limits. A WIP limit<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> is an indicator of the maximum number of items you want to have in one column at the same time. Let’s say the WIP limit for Doing is five, and you have three items you are working on. The column would display 3/5 – normally in green as the limit is not yet reached. If you start to work on three more items, it will display 6/5 in red as the limit has been reached.</p>
			<p>WIP limits can help you to focus on a small number of items and not start too much work. Start <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>with small ones and only increase if absolutely necessary. A good default to start with is five.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Reduce batch size</h2>
			<p>Limiting your <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>WIP will give you a good indication of whether your work items are the right size. If it’s hard to stay within the WIP limit, your work items are probably still too big. Try to split them into smaller tasks before increasing the limit.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Reduce hand-offs</h2>
			<p>The same is true for hand-offs. If your<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> work items need input from many team members – or worse, input from outside the team – it generates wait times and reduces your <strong class="bold">flow efficiency</strong>. Flow efficiency<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> is the time you work on a work item divided by the total time you need to get it done – including the wait time:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"><img src="image/B17827_02_001.png" alt=""/></p>
			<p>Flow efficiency is a very theoretical metric in software engineering as you normally don’t measure exact work and wait times. But if you experience many hand-offs and blocked items, the metric might help to see how your work is flowing through the system. You can start the timer for work if you move your item to Doing and start the timer for wait time if you move it back.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>GitHub issues, labels, and milestones</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">GitHub issues</strong> let <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>you keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs. They are highly cooperative and have a timeline that shows their history. Issues can be linked to commits, pull requests, and other issues. GitHub issues are part of the experience that developers love on GitHub. That’s why they are a good solution to manage your work for your engineering teams.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Creating a new issue</h2>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>create a new issue in your repository under <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Issue</strong>. The issue has a title and a body that supports Markdown (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.4</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_004.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Creating a new issue&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – Creating a new issue</p>
			<p>A toolbar helps you format the text. Besides normal formatting – such as headings, bold and italic text, lists, links, and images – it has some features that are worth highlighting:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Emoticons</strong>: You can add all sorts of emoticons<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> in Markdown. Some of my favorites are <strong class="source-inline">:+1:</strong> (👍) and <strong class="source-inline">:100:</strong> (💯) and the <strong class="source-inline">:shipit:</strong> squirrel, which is typical for GitHub. You can find a complete list here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908#file-gistfile1-md">https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908#file-gistfile1-md</a>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mentions</strong>: You can<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> mention individual members by their GitHub handle or mention entire teams. Just press <em class="italic">@</em> and start typing. Pick the person or team from the list. They’ll get notified and the mention is displayed as a link to the profile of the person or team that was mentioned. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">References</strong>: Reference <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>other issues, pull requests, or discussions by pressing the <em class="italic">#</em> key and selecting the item from the list. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Task list</strong>: A task list is<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> a list of subtasks that is later used to show the progress of the issues. Tasks in the list can be converted into issues and therefore be used to created nested hierarchies of work items. An incomplete task is prefixed with <strong class="source-inline">– [ ]</strong>. If it is completed, you add <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> in the center: <strong class="source-inline">- [x]</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Source code</strong>: You can add<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> source code with syntax highlighting to your Markdown. Just use <strong class="source-inline">```</strong> to open and close the code block. The syntax highlighting<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> is done <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>by linguist (<a href="https://github.com/github/linguist">https://github.com/github/linguist</a>) and most languages are supported.<p class="callout-heading">Markdown</p><p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Markdown</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>very popular, lightweight markup language. Unlike JSON or HTML, it formats text on a single-line basis and does not have opening and closing tags or brackets. That’s why it is very good for versioning with Git and collaborating on changes with pull requests. That’s the same reason why YAML is the de facto standard for machine-readable files. Markdown is the equivalent of human-readable files. In DevOps teams, everything is code: diagrams, architecture, design and concept documents, config files, and infrastructure. This means YAML, Markdown, or a mix of both is used.</p><p class="callout">If you have not learned Markdown yet, it’s time to start now. Many teams use Markdown extensively with pull requests to collaborate on human-readable content. Since most work management solutions also support Markdown, it’s basically everywhere.</p><p class="callout">Markdown has a very simple syntax and is easy to learn. After a few uses, it should not be a burden to use it.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can switch to preview at any time to see the output of your Markdown (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.5</em>):</p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Tip:</p>
			<p class="callout">You can also save replies if you often use similar text blocks. Hit <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">.</em> (Windows/Linux) or <em class="italic">Cmd</em> + <em class="italic">.</em> (Mac) and select the reply from the list or create a new saved reply. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies">https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Collaborating on issues</h2>
			<p>Once the issue is <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>created, you can add comments at any time. You can assign up to 10 people to the issue and apply labels to it to categorize it. All changes are displayed as events in the history of the issue (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.6</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_006.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Editing issues&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Editing issues</p>
			<p>If your issue contains a task list, it is used to display the progress of the issue. You can convert every task into an issue itself that then gets linked to the current issue. If you click the <strong class="bold">Open convert to issue</strong> button (note the mouseover visible in <em class="italic">Figure 2.6</em>), the task gets converted into a new issue and is displayed as a link. If you click the link and open the issue, you can see that the issue is tracked in another issue (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.7</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer024" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – Creating hierarchies of issues</p>
			<p>This way, you <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>can create flexible hierarchies of work and split your work into smaller tasks.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>The issue backlog</h2>
			<p>The issues overview<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> is not a real backlog as it cannot be sorted easily by drag and drop. But it has a very advanced syntax for filtering and sorting. Every filter you apply gets added as text to the search field (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.8</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_008.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – Filtering and sorting the list of issues&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Filtering and sorting the list of issues</p>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> overview, you see the progress of the tasks and the labels. You also can see pull requests that are linked to the issues.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Milestones</h2>
			<p>Milestones<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> are a way to group your issues. An issue can only be assigned to<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> exactly one milestone. Milestones measure their progress by the number of closed issues relative to the total issue count. Milestones have a title, an optional due date, and an optional description (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.9</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_009.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Planning your issues with milestones&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Planning your issues with milestones</p>
			<p>Milestones <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>are a good way to group issues to release versions with a specific target date. They can also be used to group issues that do not belong to a release version together.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Pinning issues</h2>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> pin up to three issues to your repository. These issues are displayed at the top of the issues overview (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.10</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_010.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – Pinned issues&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – Pinned issues</p>
			<p>Pinned issues are a good way to communicate important things to other contributors or new team <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>members.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Issue templates</h2>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>configure different templates for issues that give predefined content. If a user <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>creates a new issue, they can pick the template from a list (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.11</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_011.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – Issue templates&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – Issue templates</p>
			<p>You can activate <strong class="bold">issue templates</strong> in your repository under <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Options</strong> | <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> | <strong class="bold">Set up templates</strong>. You can select a basic template for bugs, features, or a custom template. The templates are files that are stored in your repository under <strong class="source-inline">.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE</strong>. Click <strong class="bold">Propose changes</strong> and commit the files to your repository. Once the template files are in your repository, you can edit or delete them directly there. Or you can also add new template files. There is no need to do this (adding new template files) from the settings.</p>
			<p>Templates can be a Markdown (<strong class="source-inline">.md</strong>) or a YAML file (<strong class="source-inline">.yml</strong>). Markdown contains a header that specifies the name and a description. It also can set defaults for the title, labels, and assignees. Here is an example of a Markdown template: </p>
			<pre class="source-code">---</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">name: 🐞 Bug report</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">about: Create a report to help us improve</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">title: ‘[Bug]:’</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">labels: [bug, unplanned]</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">assignees: </pre>
			<pre class="source-code">  - wulfland</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">---</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">**Describe the bug**</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">A clear and concise description of what the bug is.</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">**To Reproduce**</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">...</pre>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>click on <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Issue</strong>, you can select the <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>template and click <strong class="bold">Get started</strong>. A new issue will be filled with the template values. The result looks as in <em class="italic">Figure 2.12</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12 – A Markdown issue template</p>
			<p>With YAML templates, you<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> can define complete forms with text boxes, dropdowns, and checkboxes. You can configure the controls and mark<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> fields as required. A sample form could be<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> defined like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">name: 💡 Custom Issue Form</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">description: A custom form with different fields</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">body:</pre>

			<p class="callout">At the time of writing this book, YAML issue templates are still in beta and therefore subject to change.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>GitHub Projects</h1>
			<p>GitHub issues are a great way to collaborate – but with the repository scope and the lack of a drag-and-drop backlog and a visual Kanban board, they are not the perfect place to visualize and track your work.</p>
			<p>The central hub in<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> GitHub to manage your work across different repositories is <strong class="bold">GitHub Projects</strong>. It is built on top of GitHub issues and supports issues from up to 50 repositories.</p>
			<p>GitHub projects is a flexible collaboration platform. You can customize the backlog and boards and share them with other teams or the community.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note: The New GitHub Issues or GitHub Projects (Beta)</p>
			<p class="callout">At the time of writing, Git Projects is being completely reworked. The new part is currently <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>called <strong class="bold">GitHub Projects (beta)</strong> or the <strong class="bold">New GitHub Issues</strong> and <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>will replace GitHub Projects when it is ready. It is not yet 100% clear what the final name will be. Since the new experience is the future, I’ll only focus on that one in this book.</p>
			<p class="callout">Right now, the new experience is not as mature as Jira or Azure Boards. But there is a great team working on it, and I’m convinced it will be one of the best solutions on the market if it is ready!</p>
			<p class="callout">Note that there are so many new features coming out every month that all screenshots will probably be outdated in no time. Keep an eye on the <em class="italic">changelog</em> (<a href="https://github.blog/changelog/">https://github.blog/changelog/</a>) to stay up to date on all the things that are released multiple times a month.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Get started</h2>
			<p>GitHub projects <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>can contain issues and pull requests from multiple repos. Therefore, they have to be created at an organization level or in your profile for your personal repos.</p>
			<p>To create a new project, navigate to <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> on the main page of your organization or on your GitHub profile and click <strong class="bold">New Project</strong> (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.14</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14 – Creating a new project in your profile or organization</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Adding work items to projects</h2>
			<p>The default<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> view in projects is the table view. It is optimized for entering data. Press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">space</em> or click in the last row of the table. You can enter the name of a new work item directly and later convert the item into an issue. Or you can type <em class="italic">#</em> and select a repository. You can then select available issues and pull requests (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.15</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_015.jpg" alt="Figure 2.15 – Adding issues, pull requests, or draft work items to the backlog&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.15 – Adding issues, pull requests, or draft work items to the backlog</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Adding metadata to your work</h2>
			<p>You can easily <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>add different metadata fields to your project. Right now, these types are supported:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Date fields</strong>: The value must be a valid date.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Number fields</strong>: The value must be a number.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Single select</strong>: The value must be selected from a list of values.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Text field</strong>: The value can be any text.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Iteration</strong>: The value must be selected from a set of date ranges. Date ranges in the past are automatically marked as completed. A date range including the current date is marked as current.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To add a new field, press <em class="italic">Cmd</em> + <em class="italic">K</em> (Mac) or <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">K</em> (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette and start typing <strong class="source-inline">Create new field</strong>. You can also click the plus sign in the top-right corner and select <strong class="bold">+ New field</strong>. Enter a name for the field and select the field type.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Working with table views</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>default view for the project is the highly flexible <strong class="bold">table view</strong>, which you can use to enter data and prioritize it by using drag and drop to order the rows. You<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> can sort, filter, and group the data in your rows by opening the menu in the header of the columns or by opening the command palette (<em class="italic">Cmd</em> + <em class="italic">K</em> or <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">K</em>) and selecting one of the commands. If you group the table view, you can directly add items to a group or change the value of an item by dragging it to another group (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.16</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer033" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16 – The table view supports grouping, filtering, and sorting</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Working with the board view</h2>
			<p>You can switch <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>your view to a <strong class="bold">board view</strong> that displays your work as a <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>configurable Kanban board. The board can display one column for each value in any field! You can set this using<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> the <strong class="bold">column field</strong> property of the view. You can drag an item to another column to change the status. You cannot group boards yet or have swimlanes, but you can filter the board to have individual boards for different kinds of work items (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.17</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer034" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_017.jpg" alt="Figure 2.17 – The board view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17 – The board view</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>add a <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>new column by clicking the plus sign to the right of the board for any field you choose as the column field. This gives you a very flexible way to visualize your work (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.18</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer035" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_018.jpg" alt="Figure 2.18 – Choose any field as the column field for your boards&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.18 – Choose any field as the column field for your boards</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>board view<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> is optimized to visualize your work, optimize the flow, and limit WIP.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Working with views</h2>
			<p>Every time<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> you sort, filter, or group the data in a view, or switch<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> between table and board view, a blue icon in the tab header indicates that the view has unsaved changes. You can see the changes in the menu and save or discard them. You can also save them as a new view (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.19</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer036" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.19 – Working with view modifications</p>
			<p>It is simple to create new<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> customized views, rename them, and arrange them using drag and drop.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Workflows</h2>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> use <strong class="bold">workflows</strong> to define what happens when issues <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>or pull requests transition to another status. Currently, you can only enable or disable default workflows – but in the future, you will be able to write your own workflows (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.20</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer037" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_020.jpg" alt="Figure 2.20 – Workflows define what happens when items change&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.20 – Workflows define what happens when items change</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Insights</h2>
			<p>You can gain <strong class="bold">insights</strong> into your<a id="_idIndexMarker152"/> progress using the very flexible charts that report<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> on real-time data. You can access insights through the menu in the top-right corner or create a chart from a view. You can use a predefined time frame for the chart or select a custom range. You can filter the chart using macros such as <strong class="source-inline">@current</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">@next</strong> for an iteration field or <strong class="source-inline">@me</strong> for the assignee field. You can disable states in the chart by clicking on them and you can hover with the mouse over dates to see details (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.21</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer038" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_021.jpg" alt="Figure 2.21 – Getting insights with flexible charts on real-time data&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.21 – Getting insights with flexible charts on real-time data</p>
			<p>At the time<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> of <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>writing, insights only support one type of chart – the burn-up chart – and only by a number of items and statuses. But this will change soon, and you will be able to create a variety of flexible charts that you can change to all kinds of columns.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Managing access</h2>
			<p>Since projects can<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> be shared across multiple repositories, you can configure the visibility and access permissions in the settings. Projects can have a visibility of public or private. This allows you to create roadmaps that you can share with the public. In organizations, you can set the base permissions for organization members to <strong class="bold">No Access</strong>, <strong class="bold">Read</strong>, <strong class="bold">Write</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Admin</strong>. This is not possible in personal projects. But you can invite explicit collaborators and grant them <strong class="bold">Read</strong>, <strong class="bold">Write</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Admin</strong> permissions.</p>
			<p>For better discoverability, you can add projects to repositories (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.22</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer039" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_022.jpg" alt="Figure 2.22 – Adding projects to repositories&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.22 – Adding projects to repositories</p>
			<p>GitHub<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> projects are<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> a very flexible solution to manage your work and adjust it to your needs. To learn more about GitHub projects, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects">https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects</a>.</p>
			<p>Projects are still in beta. But the features that have come out are impressive and in the near future, this will be the most flexible solution that allows the easy sharing of your configuration with the community. Follow the updates in the changelog at <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/label/issues/">https://github.blog/changelog/label/issues/</a>. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Third-party integration</h1>
			<p>If you are<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> already comfortable with a mature solution such as <strong class="bold">Jira</strong> or <strong class="bold">Azure Boards</strong>, you can also keep using this solution. GitHub has great integration for nearly all available products. I will show you here how to integrate with Jira and Azure Boards – but there are many more solutions in the GitHub marketplace.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Is It Simple?</p>
			<p class="callout">Jira and Azure Boards are great products that can be highly customized. If you want to stick with your current tool, make sure that everything applies that I described in this chapter. Is it simple? Can you put all your work into it? Do you pull work from a queue? Do you have WIP limits in place? How is the flow efficiency?</p>
			<p class="callout">You might want to consider adjusting your process and item templates to a leaner way of working. Moving to a new platform is always a good opportunity to reduce ballast. If you integrate, make sure you don’t inherit debts that slow you down.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Jira</h2>
			<p>GitHub <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>and Jira both have an application in their marketplace to connect <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>both applications. If you create a new Jira project, you can directly add GitHub in the process (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.23)</em>. You can also add it later under <strong class="bold">Apps</strong> | <strong class="bold">Find new Apps</strong> in Jira.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer040" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_023.jpg" alt="Figure 2.23 – Adding GitHub for Jira to your Jira project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.23 – Adding GitHub for Jira to your Jira project</p>
			<p>The installation is <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>straightforward and is explained here: <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/jira-software-github">https://github.com/marketplace/jira-software-github</a>.</p>
			<p>You install both apps and connect to the GitHub organization in Jira. In GitHub, you can specify to select all repositories in your organization or just specific ones. If your organization has many repos, the sync can take some time!</p>
			<p>You can check your configuration and sync status in Jira under <strong class="bold">Apps</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage your apps</strong> | <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> | <strong class="bold">Get started</strong> (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.24</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.24 – GitHub configuration and sync status in Jira</p>
			<p>Once<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>synchronization is active, you link issues, pull requests, and commits to Jira issues by mentioning the ID of the Jira issue. The ID always consists of the project key and an integer representing the item (for example, <strong class="source-inline">GI-666</strong>).</p>
			<p>If you specify a Jira issue <strong class="source-inline">[GI-1]</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">[GI-2]</strong> in a GitHub issue, the text is automatically linked to the corresponding Jira issue (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.25</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer042" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.25 – Linking GitHub issues to Jira issues</p>
			<p>If you mention Jira issues in your commit messages, they are automatically linked to your Jira issues under <strong class="bold">Development</strong> (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.26</em>). You can also drill into the commits and see the files with the number of changes that are part of the commit.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer043" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.26 – Linking GitHub artifacts in Jira</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>also use <strong class="bold">smart commits</strong> to<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> perform actions with the Jira issues from <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>within your commit message. Smart commits have the following syntax:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">&lt;ignored text&gt; <strong class="bold">&lt;ISSUE_KEY&gt;</strong> &lt;ignored text&gt; <strong class="bold">#&lt;COMMAND&gt;</strong> &lt;optional COMMAND_ARGUMENTS&gt;</pre>
			<p>Currently, there are three commands supported:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">comment</strong>: Add a comment to the Jira issue.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">time</strong>: Add the time to the Jira issue you worked on it.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">transition</strong>: Change the state of the Jira issue.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here are a few <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>examples of how smart commits work:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The following commit message adds the comment <strong class="source-inline">corrected indent issue</strong> to issue <strong class="source-inline">GI-34</strong>:<p class="source-code">GI-34 #comment corrected indent issue</p></li>
				<li>This commit message adds time to <strong class="source-inline">GI.34</strong>:<p class="source-code">GI-34 #time 1w 2d 4h 30m Total work logged</p></li>
				<li>This <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>commit message adds a comment to <strong class="source-inline">GI-66</strong> and closes the issue:<p class="source-code">GI-66 #close #comment Fixed this today</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>For more information <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>on smart commits, see <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/process-issues-with-smart-commits">https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/process-issues-with-smart-commits</a>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Caution!</p>
			<p class="callout">Smart commits only work if your email address used in the commit message has sufficient rights in Jira!</p>
			<p>Jira <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>and <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>GitHub have a tight integration. If your teams are already comfortable with Jira, it’s best to stay with it and use the integration into GitHub.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Azure Boards</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Azure Boards</strong> also <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>has very tight integration<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> with GitHub. It’s very easy to set it up. You just have to install the <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>Azure Boards app from the <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>GitHub marketplace (see <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards">https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards</a>) and follow the instructions.</p>
			<p>You can link GitHub commits and GitHub pull requests directly from the Azure Boards issue (or any other work item type you have) in the <strong class="bold">Development</strong> section of the work item. Or, you can reference the work item with the following syntax: <strong class="source-inline">AB#&lt;id of Azure Board Issue&gt;</strong> (for example, <strong class="source-inline">AB#26</strong>).</p>
			<p>The GitHub links get displayed on the cards with the GitHub icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.27</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer044" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_02_027.jpg" alt="Figure 2.27 – Linking GitHub artifacts in Azure Boards&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.27 – Linking GitHub artifacts in Azure Boards</p>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>add one of the <strong class="source-inline">fix</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">fixes</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">fixed</strong> keywords before the <strong class="source-inline">AB</strong> reference, the Azure Boards issue will automatically transition to<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> the <strong class="source-inline">Done</strong> state. See the following example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The following commit message will link to issue 666 and transition the issue to done if the commit is merged:<p class="source-code">Fixes AB#666</p><p class="source-code">Update documentation and fixed AB#666</p></li>
				<li>The following commit message will link issues 42 and 666 but only transition 666 to done:<p class="source-code">Implemented AB#42 and fixed AB#666</p></li>
				<li>The keyword only works with one reference. The following commit message will link all three issues – but only 666 will be moved to done:<p class="source-code">Fixes AB#666 AB#42 AB#123</p></li>
				<li>If the keyword is not directly before the reference, no issue will be transitioned!<p class="source-code">Fixed multiple bugs: AB#666 AB#42 AB#123</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can add a badge to the README file in GitHub that shows the number of Azure Boards issues. You can get the badge URL from the settings of your Azure Boards (the small gear icon on the right above the board) in the <strong class="bold">Status badge</strong> section. You can only show the number of icons that are in progress or the number of all items (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.28</em>):</p>

			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>Azure Boards <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>integration is simple to set up and feels very natural. If your teams are already comfortable with Azure Boards, it’s a good option to stay in Azure Boards and use the tight integration with GitHub.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Case study</h1>
			<p>To start <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>with their DevOps transformation, <strong class="bold">Tailwind Gears</strong> has selected<a id="_idIndexMarker182"/> two teams that will be moved to GitHub as the new DevOps platform. </p>
			<p>The strategic decision is to move everything to GitHub and use <strong class="bold">GitHub projects</strong> and <strong class="bold">GitHub issues</strong> to manage the work. This also enables the end-to-end traceability that is needed for some teams that work in a regulated environment. Also, the development processes should be aligned during the move to the new platform.</p>
			<p>One of the pilot teams has already worked <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>with <strong class="bold">Scrum</strong> for over a year. They use <strong class="bold">Jira</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>manage their backlog and work in 3-week sprints. A closer look at the sprints shows that in every sprint, there are a lot of issues that could not be closed. Also, most of the issues are worked on simultaneously from the beginning of the sprint. When asked, the team reports that they plan all the work at the beginning of the sprint. But some of the work is blocked due to dependencies on the company ERP system. When blocked, the developers start to work on another task. In addition, some of the developers still have duties for some of their old projects. They receive tickets from the ticketing system of the help desk <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>and must provide third-level support. These tickets are hard to plan and lead to a wait time for other developers in the team that depend on work from these developers.</p>
			<p>To start on the new platform, we import all open requirements from Jira and label them as <strong class="source-inline">requirement</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">planned</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">business</strong>. If a ticket comes in, we agree to manually add a new issue and label it as <strong class="source-inline">bug</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">unplanned</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">IT</strong>. We create a separate <strong class="bold">swimlane</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>track these issues as they are normally live-side issues with a high priority. To automate the integration, we create our first team issue and label it as <strong class="source-inline">infrastructure</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">planned</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">team</strong> and move it high on the backlog.</p>
			<p>To reduce planning and wait times and establish a more pull-based flow of work, we agree to not plan the entire sprint, but to focus on the top three requirements in the backlog. The team breaks down the work for these three items and we establish a <strong class="bold">WIP limit</strong> of 5 <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>for tasks that are ongoing.</p>
			<p>The second team still works in classical waterfall; their requirements are in IBM Rational DOORS and they are used to working based on the specification documents. To move to a more agile way, the team gets some new team members:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An <strong class="bold">Agile Coach</strong> that<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> acts <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>as a <strong class="bold">Scrum Master</strong></li>
				<li>A <strong class="bold">Requirements Engineer</strong> that <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>acts as<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> the <strong class="bold">Product Owner</strong></li>
				<li>An <strong class="bold">architect</strong> from<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> the architecture team that is responsible for updating the software architecture before development starts</li>
				<li>A <strong class="bold">quality engineer</strong> that <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>is responsible for testing the application before it is released</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To start work, we export the requirements from DOORS and import them into GitHub projects. We keep the DOORS ID to be able to track back our backlog to the original requirements.</p>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>breaking down the work for the first requirement, we find that the work is too much for the sprint. The product owner splits the requirement into multiple small items to reduce the <strong class="bold">batch size</strong>. The breakdown for the most important two items shows that the items can each be done in about 1 week. There will still be some wait time for the architect and the quality engineer – but the team is confident that they have tasks that these two can help get done. For the team, it is still faster than the wait time if the work is handed over to another team.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Context switching and unplanned work kill productivity. In this chapter, you learned how to increase your productivity by moving to a lean way of working. You achieve this by establishing pull instead of push on a Kanban board, limiting your WIP and focusing on getting things done, and reducing your batch size and hand-offs.</p>
			<p>You learned how to use GitHub issues and GitHub projects to achieve this and how you can integrate Jira and Azure Boards if you prefer to stay in your existing work management system.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will have a closer look at teamwork and collaborative development.</p>
