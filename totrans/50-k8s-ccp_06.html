			<p>Kubernetes cluster management is such a huge part of managing Kubernetes as a whole. In fact, that’s probably why the <strong class="bold">Certified Kubernetes Administrator</strong> (<strong class="bold">CKA</strong>) program is so popular and a prerequisite to the <strong class="bold">Certified Kubernetes Security</strong> (<strong class="bold">CKS</strong>) exam. Although certifications aren’t the be-all-and-end-all, and you definitely don’t need them to work with Kubernetes, it gives you an idea of what a critical component is, which is the infrastructure and overall <span class="No-Break">cluster management.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The second huge piece, which is incredibly important and absolutely needed, is the containerized application deployment piece. The second set of the 50 concepts will go into overall deployments, which you’ll learn about in <span class="No-Break">these sections.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Typically, when an engineer first gets started with Kubernetes, they’ll deploy a simple web app such as nginx or Hello World. They’ll grab the container image, put it in a Kubernetes manifest, run <strong class="source-inline">kubectl apply –f</strong>, and call it a day. The point is that popping a container image in a manifest and running a command is the easy part. The hard part is thinking about the actual strategy that you’re utilizing. Will you implement GitOps? CI/CD? A service mesh? How are you managing automation and repeatability? How many apps need to be deployed? There’s a lot that goes into the thought process from a strategy and <span class="No-Break">architecture standpoint.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>By the end of these, you should have an understanding of the various ways to deploy containerized apps. Although we couldn’t go into every specific use case, you should be able to take what’s in these two chapters and have a good path forward for what to use in your <span class="No-Break">production environment.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This part of the book comprises the <span class="No-Break">following chapters:</span></p>&#13;
