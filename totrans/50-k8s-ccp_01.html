			<p>When engineers first dive into Kubernetes, it can almost feel like a tool of sorts. You use it to run and deploy containers. However, that’s not the case. Kubernetes in itself is a platform. It’s almost like a subset of a methodology to run containers. Kubernetes, among many other platforms, is why the whole <em class="italic">platform engineer</em> title is becoming so popular. The DevOps space is moving away from thinking about just tools and focusing on the entire platform <span class="No-Break">and environment.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With different platforms comes the question – where do you run it? The first set of concepts in the 50 concepts will be explained here with the overall architecture <span class="No-Break">of Kubernetes.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Kubernetes is something that’s heavily utilized in the cloud, but it’s also heavily utilized on-premises. An example of this is certain regulatory requirements. I was recently chatting with a colleague that works in the defense space. Because of the obvious heavy security requirements that they have, along with the need to stay as close to certain areas as possible, using Kubernetes at the edge was a crucial part of success. Some of the edge Kubernetes nodes were running on k3s, which is a popular method of running Kubernetes for ARM devices. Those ARM devices are on-premises, so not in <span class="No-Break">the cloud.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>On the flip side, a lot of organizations don’t have this regulatory requirement, so running Kubernetes in the cloud as a managed service is perfectly valid. It’s also an easier approach to hit the ground running with Kubernetes. For example, utilizing <strong class="bold">Azure Kubernetes Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">AKS</strong>) is a lot easier from the start than bootstrapping a five-node cluster <span class="No-Break">with Kubeadm.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>By the end of this part, you should fully understand how to get started with Kubernetes, how to run it in the cloud, and the different popular cloud services that are available for you to use. Although not every single managed Kubernetes service is covered in these four chapters, these chapters will get you through the most popular along with giving you a solid idea of how the other services will look and <span class="No-Break">be utilized.</span></p>&#13;
