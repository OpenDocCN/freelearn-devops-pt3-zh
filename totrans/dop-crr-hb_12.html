			<p>In the previous chapter, we talked about the interview process without going into too much detail. In this chapter, we will continue this discussion by diving deeper into the topic, including the different steps, the different people you may speak to, and how to best prepare for each level. To do this, I will highlight specific examples and extra details regarding typical and non-typical interviews. From coding challenges, design, situational, and IQ tests to everything in between, I will try to cover everything and give you tips to become bulletproof, regardless of the type of interview you may encounter.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Typical interview walk-through</li>
				<li>Non-typical interview walk-through</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>Typical interview walk-through </h1>
			<p>The following diagram <a id="_idIndexMarker456"/>breaks down the interview process into three phases – the initial round, the technical assessment, and the follow-ups:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1 – Interview stages reviewed </p>
			<p>We will cover these in more <a id="_idIndexMarker457"/>detail in the following sections. Simply put, each round is equally important to the outcome of the interview, so bring your A-game to each round.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>First-round interview </h2>
			<p>The first round is when you speak with the hiring manager or someone doing a similar function. You <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>will have calls with recruiters <a id="_idIndexMarker459"/>or HR beforehand, but for the purposes of this walkthrough, these are just prerequisites to the first round interview call. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">What is Considered a First-Round Interview?</p>
			<p class="callout">The first-round interview is considered the interview you have with the hiring manager, or the individual who will assess your qualifications and fit for the role. It is the interview that occurs after you have completed the human resources screening call successfully.</p>
			<p>For the first round, you must focus on doing homework on the company, check the LinkedIn profile of the interviewer (they will be your direct supervisor) for clues, and make sure you read the job description a few times. </p>
			<p>Besides background information, you should also focus on conveying your soft skills, primarily going through your experience cohesively and succinctly, and thinking how your previous experience may benefit your potential employer. </p>
			<p>In this round, they will typically go into details of the current challenges, so feel free to ask ad hoc questions throughout and save some for the end, where they will expect some questions from you. You can use this question section to tie in some of your previous <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>experiences and explain how you have <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>solved similar challenges in the past. This helps leave them with the impression that you know how to solve the challenges that they are facing and it is a wonderful way to end the call. </p>
			<p>If you are interviewing for a leadership role (and even if you are not), you should also ask about the team that you will be working with. </p>
			<p>Do not mention compensation, benefits, or anything like that unless the interviewer explicitly brings it up. </p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>diagram specifies some dos and don'ts for first-round interviews:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer108" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_9.2.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2 – First-round interview dos and don'ts&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.2 – First-round interview dos and don'ts</p>
			<p>Make sure you ask plenty of questions! This is the best time to show that you did your research, that <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>you are ready to get started, and that you <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>are passionate about the job. For a lot of companies, how interested you seem in the role is important. Your technical qualifications might be there, but if you look or sound bored through your interview, you may miss your shot! </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Technical interview </h2>
			<p>This is the most critical part of the interview as the goal is to determine the depth and breadth of your technical knowledge; there is only so much preparation you can do between the interview with the <a id="_idIndexMarker465"/>hiring manager and this phase. It is best if you do not misrepresent your skill set so that you are not asked about things you have no experience or proficiency in. If you do encounter something you do not know, explain that you have not worked in that area in the past, but that you are interested in doing so. If you pull something out of left field, you may cause irreparable harm to the trust relationship you are trying to build. </p>
			<p>Different companies will employ diverse ways to gauge your technical skills, from most common scenarios, where one or more people ask you technical questions, to the more sophisticated instances, where they may give you a design, code, or architecture challenge to do ahead of time, only to discuss it in person once submitted. Simple technical screens usually consist of a panel or multiple individual interviewers, where you can expect your technical knowledge to be explored for depth and breadth. Remember, anything in your resume is fair game. </p>
			<p>Once, I had to architect a system in the cloud and send proof of everything I had done, effectively granting access to the infrastructure I was hosting. I was later quizzed on it. </p>
			<p>Another time, I was asked to do a take-home problem that required me to use a tool I specifically stated I had no experience with. The purpose of this type of problem is to highlight your ability to learn something new – you will be judged on your ability to creatively produce a solution more than your understanding of the tool, in most cases.</p>
			<p>Many times, I have also been faced with coding challenges, which can range from general coding proficiency (for example, how would you implement this <em class="italic">XYZ?)</em> to more specific problems. These can range from honor system solutions, where you just have a day or two to return the test and there is no way to know if you googled the answer, to sophisticated third-party proctored tests, where a real person will watch you code. Some companies may want t<a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>o watch you code live and ask you questions as you work on your solution. </p>
			<p>The more demanding coding tests are typically for software engineers, but it is common for DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker466"/>engineers to be expected to have some programming proficiency. The bottom line is that it pays to know at least one language well enough to implement common algorithms and data structures. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">DevOps engineers are required to be excellent software engineers and programmers; some of the most proficient coders I have known have been fellow DevOps people.</p>
			<p>Other types of technical tests might be more domain-specific, such as writing Terraform modules or shell scripts to automate a task. Whatever the test is, make sure you gather as much intelligence on it before you start and expect to have your solution explored at length in a follow-up conversation. </p>
			<p>A design interview or challenge is a little bit different. It focuses on creating a new application or service and building the respective infrastructure and services. It may require you to make decisions around databases, security, or even areas more traditionally focused on application development. Some companies will test to see how well you understand the entire application stack. It is important to have some high-level understanding, especially in the cloud. You should know how to segregate and secure networks, as well as how to prevent the internet from accessing your backend and databases. You should know how to do authentication and create security groups and understand networking well. Distinct roles will have different focuses. Some will want to focus more on containerization and may go deeper into Kubernetes. Some may cover serverless. Getting a few certifications under your belt ensures you have a broad understanding of services that you may not have used professionally. They also help differentiate you from the competing interviewers. </p>
			<p>Even in technical rounds, it is important to end the interview by asking questions. I like to ask technical folks how well they enjoy their job, or what challenges they see. It might be a different answer from the first-round call. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Additional rounds </h2>
			<p>You should work in tandem with your recruiter to know exactly what to expect from each round. When in <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>doubt, the most foolproof method is to look up the individual on LinkedIn and see what they do. In my experience, if they are in a different area than you, such as <strong class="bold">quality assurance</strong> (<strong class="bold">QA</strong>) and testing, it is usually a cultural or team fit type of interview, which may have a few situational <a id="_idIndexMarker468"/>questions. If it is in your area, they may want to know more about your specific experiences and see if you match the challenges they face. </p>
			<p>Even if you aced the technical interview, do not relax! You can still fall short by not showing sufficient enthusiasm, or by not finishing your last interviews strongly. Remember that even if you did very well, someone else could have done better, so always give one hundred percent until the final round is complete. </p>
			<p>If possible, wait some time and ask for feedback. If you do not get the job, ask for feedback too. Sometimes, they will not give you anything more than a generic rejection, but sometimes, you get the good stuff, which points out a key flaw in your interview process, such as being <em class="italic">too hands-on</em> or <em class="italic">not hands-on enough</em>, or if your enthusiasm did not match their expectation. I had one person tell me I was not showing enough emotion and it was off-putting for them. </p>
			<p>Besides formal feedback, try to analyze your performance and give yourself some feedback. Were your answers as smooth or succinct as they could be? Did you have any knowledge gaps? </p>
			<p>The following diagram shows different types of technical interviews:</p>
			<div>

					<img src="image/Figure_9.3.jpg" alt="Figure 9.3 – Technical interview types&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.3 – Technical interview types</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will discuss the offer stage of the interview process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Offer stage </h2>
			<p>Congratulations – you cleared the loop and overcame all the hurdles, and their recruiter or HR person has reached out to let you know they would like to make you an offer! Typically, they <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>make a verbal offer and if you accept verbally, they will extend a written one, which usually has an expiration date – around 48 hours to a week. </p>
			<p>Now, if you have been interviewing with multiple companies concurrently, you may be in the process of receiving more than one offer and potentially be able to negotiate further. Be careful with overplaying your hand, since companies may rescind their offer if they think you are just using them to get a better offer elsewhere or to improve your existing situation at work. The point is that you should tread carefully as the job is not yours yet, so treat this as the final stage of the interview. </p>
			<p>You should focus on being very enthusiastic about the role, even while you negotiate. Also, try to be flexible when it comes to improvements in your offer, since they may have more flexibility in one area than another. Be wary of telling all your other opportunities that you have received an offer too early, as it may prove counterproductive. Do not mention companies by name or give away too much in terms of the specifics. If you get two or more offers, then negotiate in earnest, but only do so if you are willing to walk away from the opportunity you are trying to improve. </p>
			<p>Sometimes, people will take the offer back to the company they work for and get a raise. This might be a good short-term way to get a raise out of band but it can also generate negative <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>feedback and, depending on the employment market, they may look for some insurance in the future so that it does not happen again. Take this case by case. If you have not received a raise in several years and you get an offer, negotiate on both ends. Just try to manage your options so that you are still on good terms with both companies after deciding. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Non-typical interview walk-through </h1>
			<p>While most interviews tend to fall into a pattern, occasionally, you will encounter something out of the norm that is worth highlighting. In this section, we will cover pre-screening tests, out-of-the-box designs, and example questions such as the infamous <em class="italic">Tell me a time when</em> formatted question.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Tests </h2>
			<p>First, let's start with pre-screening tests. Some companies want to know your personality type and will <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>want you to take a personality test ahead of time. This can range from one page where you evaluate five words you identify with, to long 15+ question exams. </p>
			<p>Sometimes, this is paired with a cognitive test, which is like a traditional IQ test, albeit with a lot less time dedicated to this. I have taken the <strong class="bold">Criteria Cognitive Aptitude Test</strong> (<strong class="bold">CCAT</strong>) several times, and it is 50 questions in 15 minutes. Only once did I finish <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>all 50, and there was a generous amount of guessing to get that done. The questions range from math and logic questions to spatial and verbal questions such as analogies or antonyms. It requires all your focus, so try not to take these types of tests when you are tired or may be distracted. </p>
			<p>I have even heard that some private equity companies have everyone in the companies they invest in take these tests! There is not much you can do to prepare for these types of tests, but you can stack the deck in your favor by making sure you have 15 minutes of <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>uninterrupted focus, at the time when your brain operates at peak capacity. Since you are not penalized for guessing, you should always dedicate the last minute to guessing all the remaining questions. </p>
			<p>If you do not have experience with these types of tests, try finding a practice test:</p>

			<p>The preceding screenshot shows an example of a verbal question from <a href="https://www.criteriacorp.com/">https://www.criteriacorp.com/</a>. The following screenshot shows an example of a math question, also from <a href="https://www.criteriacorp.com/">https://www.criteriacorp.com/</a>:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.5 – Sample CCAT question – 2</p>
			<p>Besides personality and cognitive tests, you have programming and design tests, which we have talked <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>about previously. For traditional programming tests, <a href="https://leetcode.com/">https://leetcode.com/</a> is a suitable place to start, as is <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">https://www.hackerrank.com/</a>. For books, check out <em class="italic">Cracking the coding interview</em>, by <em class="italic">Gayle Laakmann McDowell,</em> which contains a lot of tips specific to companies. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Out-of-the-box design </h2>
			<p>For design, this is a little bit more complicated, but there are a few good books that go in-depth into <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>system design and can help you not only on offline tests but also in working through a design problem live with an interviewer. For cloud-related design, check out reference architectures from the cloud provider itself. If you study a few samples, you will get a handle on what is common to a lot of scenarios and be able to think of solutions more rapidly. I recommend that you become acquainted with at least one tool for diagramming and try to design a sample three-tier application in the tool before you are forced to do this live. </p>
			<p>You could encounter a non-conventional problem, such as the famous <em class="italic">how many manholes in New York</em> or something like that. I was asked what I would do if I was shrunk down and put in a blender. I was also asked to design the process for a map application from the <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>ground up, in an underdeveloped country lacking infrastructure. A company may also ask you to design one of their services, improve it, or create something new. A lot of big tech companies may screen you this way, regardless of your specific technical role, so saying you are in <em class="italic">DevOps</em> may not preclude you from this. </p>
			<p>The following figure contains some non-conventional questions:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer112" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_9.6.jpg" alt="Figure 9.6 – Ridiculously hard interview questions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6 – Ridiculously hard interview questions</p>
			<p>Thankfully, the most insane of the brain teaser types of questions have become extinct for the most part and are no longer seriously being used to screen candidates. As always, ask your recruiter what to expect and if the company is large enough, the internet is bound to have additional intelligence on what types of questions or design problems they can throw at you. What matters the most in these types of exercises is that you can convey your thinking, that it is clear and logical, and that you consider exceptions and edge cases when devising solutions. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Tell me about a time</h2>
			<p>One of my favorite cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>providers is famous for asking situational questions that start with the <em class="italic">tell me about a time</em> mantra. These types of questions will ask you about your professional experience, how you overcame adversity, and how you deal with every possible professional situation. The catch is that you should do it in the STAR format – <strong class="bold">situation</strong>, <strong class="bold">task</strong>, <strong class="bold">action</strong>, and <strong class="bold">result</strong> – as shown in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer113" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_9.7.jpg" alt="Figure 9.7 – STAR technique &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.7 – STAR technique </p>
			<p>What happened, what did you do, and what was the result? Here, you should put less emphasis on the company or team and focus on your contributions. The ideal candidate is a maverick that will go against the current norm and challenge the status quo to get the best outcome for yourself, your team, or your customers. </p>
			<p>One of the challenges here is that your own experiences may not be quite as interesting or as heroic, or that you may not have an arsenal ready to use at a moment's notice. This might be a pain, but the solution is simple. Create a document and start working on stories, answering sample questions in the STAR format. You do not want to repeat stories in the same interview loop with the same company, so make sure you can pivot to a different story if there is a similar question that you have already used your story for.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Tell me about a time when you had to work with someone difficult to work with? </em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">ST</em>: I had to work with a teammate who was difficult to work with. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">A</em>: I spent extra time getting to know this person and our relationship improved. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">R</em>: This person is now great to work with. </p>
			<p>Now, this story does not have any flavor, but I stripped that out to show you the core mechanic. </p>
			<p>So, how can you make your story better? You can add data and numbers. Adding a quantitative feel to <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>your story makes it more memorable and impressive (especially compared to the stories of other candidates that do not have concrete data to share). </p>
			<p>Typically, the R portion should be positive, but it does not always have to be completely positive. If it shows that you went beyond, even a negative outcome can be seen as a positive answer, as shown in the following example:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Tell me about a time when you had to work with someone difficult to work with? </em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">ST</em>: As a junior developer working at ABC company, a member of my squad did everything they could to cause drama with me. They went out of their way t<a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>o try and drive distance between myself and other squad members.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">A</em>: I was new to the team and the individual who I was having a tough time with had been a member for 4.5 years. I invited the individual to lunch so that we could get to know each other better. Additionally, I made it clear I was in no way trying to take over their team and only assist as needed.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">R</em>: 2.5 years later and drama dude and I are peers, and we tend to have a strong working relationship. We respect each other but also are extremely competitive with each other as we are constantly trying to push each other just a little bit further. Honestly, without the relationship we have, I would not have been promoted to a senior engineer on the same team as him. He is one of the individuals who recommended I apply for this position.</p>
			<p>Be aware that this type of question can apply to both technical and non-technical scenarios. There is a stronger bias toward leadership questions the more senior you are, but you should be prepared to frame any answer in the STAR format. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Mistakes to Avoid </p>
			<p class="callout">When answering questions, avoid using <em class="italic">we</em> or <em class="italic">us</em>. Instead, focus on what you did. Even if it was a team effort, focus on what you provided for the solution. </p>
			<p class="callout">Another mistake I see candidates make is answering a question with a simple yes/no instead of using the opportunity to sneak in some more relevant information about themselves. Depending on the position you are interviewing for, you may be allowed to redeem yourself if the interviewer asks you directly for a more specific example. </p>
			<p>To recap, find a list <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>of situational interview questions and start answering them, keeping your questions and answers handy in some cloud document. Then, refine your answers so that they are snappy and easier to share. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Summary </h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered traditional and non-typical interview walk-throughs in more detail. </p>
			<p>We covered the traditional stages of the interview process and focused on the technical assessment stage, discussing diverse types of tests and screening, as well as how to prepare. </p>
			<p>We also discussed non-traditional interview scenarios, such as cognitive and personality tests, situational exercises, and design questions, including out-of-the-box brain teasers and others. We stressed practicing tests and writing out our answers to the most common situational questions ahead of time and keeping them handy. Practice makes perfect, and interviewing is not an exception!</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss tips and tricks for applications and the interview process.</p>
