			<p>The idea behind Kubernetes is to make engineers’ lives easier, right? Although true, there are pros and cons to every technology and platform. At the end of the day, Kubernetes does make handling containerization more efficient, but that doesn’t mean that it’s easy. Many organizations and engineers put in a lot of effort to truly get Kubernetes running the way it <span class="No-Break">should run.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The goal of this book, and the overall 50 concepts, is to help mitigate some of these headaches. Although one book cannot mitigate every single issue that can occur, or make every single component work the way that it’s supposed to, the overall goal is to help you use Kubernetes in an easier fashion in production, with 50 key pieces ranging from cloud to on-prem to monitoring and security, and everything in between. The world is currently full of content and ways to teach you Kubernetes. This book is to help you make it to the <span class="No-Break">next level.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Throughout this book, you’ll see everything from creating environments to deploying a service mesh and Kubernetes resources. I won’t lie – a lot of the topics in this book are literally books in themselves. Because of that, the explanations and overall pieces had to be trimmed down a bit. Because of that, you may not have all of the answers in this book, but it’ll give you an extremely good place to start your Kubernetes <span class="No-Break">production journey.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With the 50 concepts in mind, you should be able to take what you learn here and ultimately expand on it in your production environment. Take what you learn, apply it, and ultimately, know which direction to go in to learn more about <span class="No-Break">the concepts.</span></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
			<p>This book is for the engineer that wants to use Kubernetes in production. Perhaps you’ve just learned the basics and beginner-level information about Kubernetes, and you’re now ready to make it to the next level. Maybe you’re getting ready to implement Kubernetes in production or test out containerized workloads for your environment. In either case, you can use this book as a source to showcase what you should be thinking about <span class="No-Break">in production.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Think about this book as almost a “guide.” There’s theory, hands-on sections, and actual code that works from start to finish to create and deploy Kubernetes resources. As mentioned in the preface, this book can’t cover every single topic in depth, as many of the topics are books within themselves, but you can use it as a “guide” to deploy <span class="No-Break">to production.</span></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19116_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Kubernetes in Today’s World</em>, goes over, from a theoretical perspective, how you should think about Kubernetes in the current ecosystem – things such as why it’s important, what the whole idea of “cloud native” means, and what containerization as a whole is doing <span class="No-Break">for engineers.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19116_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Getting the Ball Rolling with Kubernetes and the Top Three Cloud Platforms</em>, hits the ground running with cluster deployments. You’ll learn how to deploy Kubernetes clusters in Azure, AWS, and GCP. You’ll see from a UI/GUI perspective how to deploy the clusters with code. This chapter uses Terraform for <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>), as that’s currently the most popular method <span class="No-Break">in production.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19116_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Running Kubernetes with Other Cloud Pals</em>, teaches you how to deploy the top three most popular managed Kubernetes services. However, that doesn’t mean those are the only methods. In this chapter, you’ll see a few more popular options that are used in production but are mostly used for testing production workloads, as they’re a bit cheaper from a <span class="No-Break">cost perspective.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In today’s cloud-centric world, a lot of technical marketing and content that you see on social media doesn’t talk about on-prem. The reality is that on-prem, especially on-prem Kubernetes clusters, are still very much a thing. In <a href="B19116_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">The On-Prem Kubernetes Reality Check</em>, you’ll learn about how to think about on-prem from a theoretical perspective and a <span class="No-Break">bit hands-on.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19116_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Kubernetes Apps Like a True Cloud Native</em>, starts your journey into deploying applications to the cloud. In the first few chapters, you learned about cluster management, which is drastically important but only one half of the puzzle. The second piece of the puzzle is actual Kubernetes <span class="No-Break">resource deployment.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Starting off where you left off in the previous chapter, <a href="B19116_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Kubernetes Deployment – Same Game, Next Level</em>, takes Kubernetes resource deployments to the next level. You’ll be introduced to concepts such as CI/CD, GitOps, and service mesh deployments. This is considered the “advanced” piece of Kubernetes resource deployments, which you’ll see a lot of <span class="No-Break">in production.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Up until this point in the book, you’ve learned how to deploy and manage clusters and applications. Once clusters and apps are deployed, you then need to confirm that they’re running as expected. That’s where observability and monitoring come into play, which we will look at in <a href="B19116_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor161"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Kubernetes Monitoring </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">and Observability</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To wrap up any Kubernetes production deployment, you need to think about one major element before any resource reaches production – security. Security is the make or break between a successful environment and a long weekend of putting out fires. In <a href="B19116_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Security Reality Check</em>, you’ll learn the major components to secure a Kubernetes environment and a few key tools and platforms that you can use to make <span class="No-Break">it happen.</span></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>&#13;
			<p>This book is a healthy combination of theory and hands-on. The reason for this is that theory is great, but if you don’t know how to implement it, it’s not going to be much use to you in production. To follow along with this book, you should have access to the major clouds, a few VMs, and perhaps a few dollars to spend on <span class="No-Break">the environments.</span></p>&#13;
