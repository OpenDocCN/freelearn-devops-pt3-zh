- en: Both DevOps and the **Scaled Agile Framework®** (**SAFe**®) are about extending
    agility beyond the team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DevOps looks to extend agility beyond the “traditional” boundary of development
    to include the deployment and release of the development to a production environment.
    This includes what to do if the new changes developed introduce failures in the
    production environment, activities typically done by operations teams.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SAFe® strives to extend an Agile mindset to products that require multiple teams
    to develop and maintain. In this paradigm, alignment and the ability to properly
    execute delivery and release are among the important factors for success. Both
    these factors are encouraged by DevOps. It is for this reason that to implement
    SAFe, you need to make sure that DevOps is implemented as well.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book looks at the DevOps approach used in the SAFe. While there are practices
    specific to SAFe, many of the concepts, practices, and theories we introduce for
    DevOps are truly universal and are not limited to SAFe exclusively.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18756_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Introducing SAFe® and DevOps*,
    is a brief look at the history of how DevOps and SAFe came to be. We view the
    conditions that brought about Agile development, the evolution of Agile development
    to the DevOps movement, and the role SAFe can play in moving to DevOps.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B18756_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040), *Culture of Shared Responsibility*,
    covers the types of cultures that are present in organizations today, which are
    beneficial for DevOps. We also look at how to change your organization’s culture
    to one that is needed for DevOps.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B18756_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor066), *Automation for Efficiency
    and Quality*, explores the automation and technology used by organizations to
    establish a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment** (**CI/CD**) pipeline.
    We look at tools used for monitoring and measuring the pre-production and production
    environments. We then finish by discussing the teams responsible for setting it
    up.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B18756_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086), *Leveraging Lean Flow to Keep
    the Work Moving*, describes the principles and methods to accomplish a Lean Flow
    as part of SAFe. We examine the roles that the size of the work, the length of
    the backlog, how busy our workers are, and the differences between items of work
    play in the time it takes to complete the work.'

    Solution*, studies the potential measurements needed to ensure value, security,
    and reliability of the product under development. We look at the measurements
    that help identify whether teams have flow in their development. We explore monitoring
    and observability to find the metrics that ensure the solution is secure and reliable.
    Finally, we look to collecting metrics that assess the product’s end-user value.'

    Failures*, outlines some methods to ensure reliability of the product in a customer-facing
    environment. We look at examples of famous production failures. We explore the
    discipline of **Site Reliability Engineering** (**SRE**), developed at Google
    to establish practices and ensure reliable environments. We finish our exploration
    by looking at Chaos Engineering, which strives to prepare for production failures
    by establishing experiments of failure in a production environment.'

    takes a look at how to identify and establish value streams with a value stream
    identification workshop. We will explore how to prepare for the workshop and the
    mindset needed for moving to value streams. We then look at the steps needed to
    identify and map the Operational Value Stream. We finish by identifying and mapping
    the Development Value Stream.'

    delves into the metrics that are used to improve value streams. We explore the
    metrics that are organized by the DevOps Research and Assessment organization,
    known as the DORA metrics. We also explore Flow Metrics, a part of the Flow Framework
    created by Tasktop.'

    Finding New Features*, elaborates on the first phase of the Continuous Delivery
    Pipeline, Continuous Exploration. We explore the use of epics as hypotheses of
    potential customer value. We elaborate on the hypotheses by ensuring the architecture
    can allow for these new ideas and maintain the security and reliability of the
    product. We then look at decomposing the epics into features, ready for an Agile
    Release Train to develop.'
