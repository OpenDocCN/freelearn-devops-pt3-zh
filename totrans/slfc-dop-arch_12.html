If you don’t have a license, there is a 30-day fully featured free trial available at <a href="http://gearset.com">gearset.com</a> so that you can try <span class="No-Break">things out.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Gearset overview</h1>
			<p>Gearset emerged in 2015 as a specialized tool designed for release management within the Salesforce ecosystem. It was created by a team based in the Microsoft developer ecosystem, who found <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>themselves surprised how Salesforce lacked comparable DevOps tools to those they were used to in the Microsoft world. As it has grown and matured, Gearset offers a comprehensive suite of features that cater to various aspects of deployment and <span class="No-Break">data management.</span></p>
			<p>Central to Gearset’s functionality is its ability to deploy changes rapidly and reliably. By simplifying the deployment process, Gearset allows users to focus more on the strategic aspects of release management rather than being entangled in the complexities of <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></p>
			<p>The platform integrates multiple key features under one roof, facilitating a seamless and integrated experience. This integration not only streamlines the workflow but also ensures that users have access to a wide range of tools essential for effective release management. From automating release pipelines to offering advanced data management and backup capabilities, Gearset provides a robust and versatile solution to meet the diverse needs of <span class="No-Break">Salesforce professionals.</span></p>
			<p>Gearset’s comprehensive feature set, coupled with an intuitive design, makes it an indispensable tool for <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>professionals seeking to optimize their Salesforce deployment processes. Let’s look at some of that feature set now, grouped by the area of DevOps that each feature best <span class="No-Break">relates to:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 12.1 – Gearset capabilities in each key area of Salesforce DevOps</p>
			<p>As you can see, Gearset is <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>a comprehensive Salesforce DevOps platform, covering the core requirements of a mature solution. Next, we’ll start looking at how it works in more detail, identifying key strengths and <span class="No-Break">any weaknesses.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>Gearset’s strengths</h1>
			<p>At the heart of Gearset’s technology is its metadata comparison engine, which can quickly identify net changes between a source and target set of metadata, whether that’s in source <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>control or in a Salesforce org, in both directions. This allows Salesforce practitioners to quickly see what has changed and build that into a deployment or a set of changes to commit to source control in an easy-to-understand user interface. In the following screenshot, we can see a line-by-line comparison of <span class="No-Break">XML metadata:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer036">
					<img alt="Figure 12.1 – Gearset’s comparison of XML metadata﻿. &#10;The intent of this screenshot is to show the page layout; text readability is not essential. " src="image/B19436_12_1.jpg"/>

				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer037">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2 – Gearset’s comparison of picklist values, with a custom user interface instead of XML</p>
			<p>A core aspect of Gearset’s appeal lies in its deep understanding of Salesforce metadata, allowing users to manage and deploy changes with a level of detail and insight that is rare in the realm of DevOps tools. This capability is especially critical when handling complex deployments, which can often be fraught with challenges <span class="No-Break">and risks.</span></p>
			<p>Gearset’s metadata <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>handling capability, therefore, is not just a feature; it represents a fundamental shift in how Salesforce deployments are managed, making them more accessible and less error-prone. This commitment to reducing errors is best evidenced in Gearset’s problem analyzers, which check the artifacts in each deployment for potential issues that may prevent the deployment from being successful. By combining static code analysis with its knowledge of metadata dependencies and common issues, many issues are not only pre-empted but can be automatically resolved before actual deployment. The next screenshot shows how Gearset has identified <span class="No-Break">some issues:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer038">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.4 – Problem detail and the option to automatically resolve it within Gearset</p>
			<p>Beyond basic deployment, Gearset excels in CI and testing. In software development, maintaining high standards of code quality is essential, and Gearset’s tools in this area ensure that these standards are not just met but consistently upheld. By automating key parts of the testing and integration process, Gearset helps teams focus on development rather than getting bogged down by the mechanics of testing and integration. This automation is a game-changer, particularly for teams working on large-scale or complex Salesforce projects, where the scope for errors <span class="No-Break">is significant.</span></p>
			<p>The flagship automation feature of Gearset is called <strong class="bold">Pipelines</strong>, a visual representation of the various environments and repositories that make up your continuous integration and continuous deployment CI/CD pipeline (hence the name), which enables teams to manage their <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>entire release pipeline more efficiently. It integrates seamlessly with tools such as version control providers and Jira and features advanced branch management for handling multiple <span class="No-Break">branches simultaneously:</span></p>

			<p>Gearset’s data backup and recovery features address another critical need in Salesforce DevOps – data security. In an era where data is not just valuable but also vulnerable, having robust backup and recovery mechanisms is non-negotiable. Gearset’s approach to data backup is comprehensive, ensuring that not only is data securely backed up but also easily recoverable in the event of loss or corruption. This level of data security and management is a significant strength, offering peace of mind and operational stability to <span class="No-Break">Salesforce teams:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.6 – Gearset data backup jobs</p>
			<p>Gearset’s strengths as a Salesforce DevOps platform are rooted in its holistic approach to Salesforce <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>management. It’s not just a tool; it’s a solution that comprehensively addresses the multifaceted challenges of Salesforce DevOps. From deployment to testing, and data management to recovery, Gearset stands out as a platform that understands and effectively responds to the needs of the Salesforce <span class="No-Break">DevOps community.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>Gearset’s weaknesses</h1>
			<p>Where some see strengths, others see weaknesses, and Gearset certainly isn’t immune to this, particularly in comparison to other Salesforce DevOps solutions – something that happens often <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>when organizations are starting their DevOps journey and determining which solution best fits <span class="No-Break">their needs.</span></p>
			<p>The flexibility to choose your approach to how you want to manage your DevOps process is often perceived as a weakness for teams that need a little more guidance and handholding with a specific approach. Equally, while some see strength in Gearset being an application outside of the Salesforce platform and integrating into it via APIs, others perceive it not being a Salesforce native application as <span class="No-Break">a weakness.</span></p>
			<p>Gearset is specifically tailored for the Salesforce core platform, with the additional support of <a id="_idIndexMarker546"/>features such as <strong class="bold">CPQ</strong> and Salesforce Industries (formerly known as <strong class="bold">Vlocity</strong>). For teams looking <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>for an all-in-one DevOps solution that covers not only other Salesforce products (or “clouds”) but other non-Salesforce platforms too, Gearset will not come across as the best choice. Some tech leaders prefer to invest in all-in-one solutions for their entire <span class="No-Break">IT estate.</span></p>
			<p>For more advanced <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>DevOps practitioners, the lack of direct code-editing capabilities and API access is limiting, as it hinders integration with other tools and automation of certain processes in a more scripted fashion as other <span class="No-Break">solutions provide.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s a recap of those points to aid your <span class="No-Break">decision process:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 12.2 - A summary of Gearset's weaknesses</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Gearset has emerged as a leading DevOps solution tailored specifically for the Salesforce ecosystem. Its comprehensive feature set allows it to address a wide spectrum of needs related to deployment, testing, data management, and backup/recovery. Gearset simplifies and streamlines processes such as metadata deployment and CI, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. This efficiency stems not just from automating rote tasks but also from Gearset’s deep insight into <span class="No-Break">Salesforce metadata.</span></p>
			<p>While some may perceive Gearset’s flexibility and Salesforce-focused approach as weaknesses compared to broader, all-in-one DevOps platforms, Gearset unquestionably excels at managing core Salesforce development and release processes. For teams looking to optimize their Salesforce DevOps workflows, few tools match Gearset’s combination of robust functionality and intuitive usability. As Salesforce projects grow larger and more complex, Gearset provides the reliability and precision needed to ship updates with confidence. For most Salesforce teams, Gearset should be a strong contender as a <span class="No-Break">DevOps solution.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we move on to look at one of the other major players in Salesforce DevOps: Copado. In much the same way, we’ll look at its key strengths and weaknesses as an out-of-the-box solution for <span class="No-Break">Salesforce DevOps.</span></p>
