			<p><em class="italic">Part</em> <em class="italic">1</em> of this book introduces the contemporary business landscape that requires the attention of <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>all companies, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. Our global economy is undergo<a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>ing rapid and disruptive change driven by digital technologies and digitally enhanced products. This section briefly introduces the concepts behind Lean, Agile, and VSM practices in a <span class="No-Break">digital context.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Understanding the digital economy’s landscape</h2>
			<p>The concept <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>of the digital economy is more than just a trend. It’s a new business paradigm. The term <em class="italic">digital</em> <em class="italic">economy</em> came into use in the 1990s and was the subject of Don Tapscott’s 1995 book, <em class="italic">The Digital Economy:</em> <em class="italic">Promise</em> <em class="italic">and</em> <em class="italic">Peril</em> <em class="italic">in</em> <em class="italic">the</em> <em class="italic">Age</em> <em class="italic">of</em> <em class="italic">Networked</em> <em class="italic">Intelligence</em>.<span class="superscript">1</span> As digital computing technologies <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>and the internet have evolved, they’ve significantly transformed how businesses operate, particularly in eBusiness and eCommerce. Today, the lines between digital and traditional economies are increasingly blurred, making it challenging to distinguish between <span class="No-Break">the two.</span></p>
			<p>The digital economy is built on countless daily online exchanges. These exchanges involve diverse participants – from individuals with disparate roles and responsibilities to various entities, such as companies, government agencies, schools, and charitable organizations. Their interactions extend across numerous digital platforms, encompassing everything from large-scale servers to personal devices such as laptops, smartphones, and <span class="No-Break">wearable technology.</span></p>
			<p>Disruptive technology has broad implications. Players such as <strong class="bold">Airbnb</strong>, <strong class="bold">Amazon</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Uber </strong>do more than challenge the norm; they have redefined people’s responsibilities, requisite skills, knowledge, and job opportunities. Navigating this enormous change demands more than<a id="_idTextAnchor019"/> tech comprehension – it requires a digital-first mindset. Those leveraging these connections will be able to compete as data-driven relationships between businesses and customers become <span class="No-Break">the norm.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Embracing Lean-Agile and VSM in the digital economy</h2>
			<p>Lean-Agile principles present a robust structure for staying agile and adaptable to relentless <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>change while remaining productive and efficient. These principles underpin businesses’ ability to swiftly adapt, refine operations, and consistently offer value in a digital world marked by <span class="No-Break">rapid shifts.</span></p>
			<p>VSM <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>complements Lean and Agile, providing a holistic viewpoint to identify, assess, and enhance value flow from end <span class="No-Break">to end.</span></p>
			<p>Pairing Lean, Agile, and VSM practices is the secret sauce for surviving and excelling in the digital economy. These methods are more than survival tools; they’re the scaffolding upon which sustainable, competitive, and ever-evolving businesses can <span class="No-Break">be<a id="_idTextAnchor021"/> built.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s begin our exploration with an introduction to <span class="No-Break">Lean Thinking.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Exploring the hallmarks of Lean Thinking</h1>
			<p>The goal <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>of Lean is to maximize customer value, quality, and efficiency by minimizing waste and non-value-adding costs while optimizing delivery speed and throughput. The elimination of waste is the hallmark of Lean principles, as depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – Classic eight wastes of Lean</p>
			<p>The essence of Lean is simple: organizations should refrain from investing in endeavors that produce excess work, features, or capabilities that customers neither desire nor find valuable. Failing to do so might drive external or internal customers to seek alternative products or services. The complexity lies in determining what customers need and the level of quality they anticipate while eliminating any elements that fail to align with their objectives. Lean practitioners refer to these excesses <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">waste</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>A Lean enterprise’s imperative is continuously maximizing customer value at the lowest possible cost by minimizing waste. The objective is not to reduce staff numbers to achieve these goa<a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>ls, but rather to optimize workforce utilization. The focus is on avoiding and <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>eliminating existing wasteful activities and processes, streamlining workflows, and ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to enhance productivity and deliver superior value <span class="No-Break">to customers.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> illustrates four focus areas and the 14 elements of Lean Thinking as illustrated in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.2</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Foundational principles</h2>
			<p>The foundational <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>principles focus area centers on the fostering a culture of perpetual enhancement through practices such as continuous improvement (<strong class="bold">Kaizen</strong>) and quality improvement, alongside promoting active employee involvement and cultivating respect <span class="No-Break">for people.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Streamlining flows</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>streamlined flows focus area emphasizes optimization of processes by targeting waste reduction (<strong class="bold">Muda</strong>) and employing tools such as VSM and value stream mapping to identify and eliminate inefficiencies. Additionally, Lean advocates for standardization of work procedures and utiliz<a id="_idTextAnchor026"/><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>es visual management techniques to enhance clarity and efficiency <span class="No-Break">across operations.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Customer value</h2>
			<p>The customer <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>value focus area revolves around aligning organizational efforts with customer needs to enhance their overall satisfaction and loyalty. This involves optimizing productivity, efficiency, and cost-reduction strategies to deliver products and services that maximize <span class="No-Break">customer value.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Optimized flows</h2>
			<p>The optimized <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>flow focus area advocates implementing pull-oriented production control systems, starting new work based on upstream demand signals, thus minimizing waste, and enhancing responsiveness to <span class="No-Break">cust<a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>omer needs.</span></p>
			<p>Having established the key elements of Lean thinking, we will now explore why they are <span class="No-Break">so critical.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Prioritizing Lean methodologies – redefining operational excellence</h2>
			<p>Too often, in less disciplined organizations, we fall into a trap where everything becomes <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>a priority, which leads to conflict, constant firefighting, and employee burnout. However, Lean organizations cut through all that clutter by constantly evaluating changes that have the greatest impact on adding value to their customers. Through the elimination of constraints and waste and leveraging the resources available, Lean organizations maintain a focus on what truly matters, which sustains competitive advantage and avoids all the issues associated with making everything <span class="No-Break">a priority.</span></p>
			<p>In Lean organizations, operational excellence is not just a goal, but a guiding principle ingrained in every aspect of the organization. Unlike traditional management structures, where inefficiencies may be tolerated or overlooked, Lean organizations prioritize continuous improvement, waste reduction, and customer value creation as core tenets of their operations. By systematically adopting Lean practices and principles, these organizations achieve streamlined processes, empowered employees, and a culture of relentless innovation. From the Agile teams or shop floor to the boardroom, Lean organizations differentiate themselves by their unwavering commitment to efficiency, quality, and <span class="No-Break">customer s<a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>atisfaction.</span></p>
			<p>This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>book on the integration of Lean and Agile practices. So, now that we have a high-level understanding of the fundamental goals and elements of the Lean enterprise, let’s explore Agile principles and practices to see how they contrast <span class="No-Break">with Lean.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Embracing Agile methodologies</h1>
			<p>While Lean principles focus on enhancing efficiency and productivity, Agile practices serve as an effective approach to develop new solutions and address business challenges. Agile <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>prioritizes enhancing business agility, enabling organizations to embrace changes to retain value <span class="No-Break">and competitiveness.</span></p>
			<p>Agile introduces methods and tools that facilitate proactive change, foster creativity, and promote innovation, allowing you to tackle complex problems. Unlike Lean’s continuous flow philosophy, Agile advocates an <em class="italic">iterative and incremental</em> timeboxed approach empowering teams to create new value in rapid development cycles that align work with custo<a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>mers’ evolving needs and the dynamic <span class="No-Break">business landscape.</span></p>
			<p>This book provides actionable insights into how Agile’s iterative development and incremental delivery mindset can accelerate problem-solving and innovation, benefiting your professional career by honing essential skills. Let’s commence by grasping the core Agile concepts that will empower your <span class="No-Break">professional journey.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Understanding the origins of Agile</h2>
			<p>To comprehend Agile methodologies, it’s essential to understand their origins. While Lean principles <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>originated in auto manufacturing, particularly at Toyota, Agile emerged from the software industry. This stark contrast sheds light on their unique approaches to achieving efficiency and <span class="No-Break">delivering value.</span></p>
			<p>Lean principles trace their lineage to post-World War II Japan, where Toyota grappled with limited resources and the aftermath of a global conflict. To thrive under these constraints, Toyota developed Lean practices, focusing on optimizing processes and conserving resources to deliver maximum value with minimal waste, laying the foundation for efficient <span class="No-Break">production systems.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, Agile methodologies originated in the dynamic realm of software development. Engineers and developers faced a fundamental problem – traditional linear-sequential and plan-driven project management approaches couldn’t cope with the unpredictability <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>of software projects. Agile introdu<a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>ced an iterative development paradigm with rapid deliveries, encouraging small, valuable increments of a product to address evolving requirements and ensure customer satisfaction and <span class="No-Break">product excellence.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Expanding Agile – beyond software development</h2>
			<p>While Agile’s origins may be in software, its principles have proven highly adaptable and beneficial across various industries and business domains. Agile’s iterative and incremental development approach <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>has found application in sectors ranging from healthcare and manufacturing to marketing and education, offering opportunities for teams <span class="No-Break">to excel.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, organizations seeking sustainable competitive advantage should recognize that the Agile mindset extends beyond software development, enhancing teamwork and driving continuous improvement across all business domains. This evolution of Agile from a specialized software development approach to a versatile problem-solving and innovation methodology underscores its enduring relevance and impact. It equips teams with a valuable sk<a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>ill set to remain competitive and <span class="No-Break">drive success.</span></p>
			<p>With this understanding, let’s now explore how the Agile workflow differs from the pull-oriented concepts <span class="No-Break">of Lean.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Iterating to deliver incremental value</h2>
			<p>Agile methodologies prioritize iterative value creation, avoiding upfront requirement predictions <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>that often quickly become irrelevant and a costly form of waste. Instead, they advocate continuous development of small, valuable product increments with active customer and stakeholder involvement, promoting flexibility,  adaptability,  and responsiveness. This approach contrasts with Lean’s pull-oriented approach, which focus on streamlining  processes  and minimizing waste through continuous flow. Agile engages in timeboxed iterations, typically lasting 1 to 4 weeks, where work is pulled from a product backlog based on priorities and readiness, enabling focused development efforts. Unlike Lean’s continuous flow, Agile ensures a collaborative yet structured environment by assigning work based on individual capacity and skills. Some Agile teams integrate Lean elements such as Kanban to further optimize workflows, highlighting the flexibility of <span class="No-Break">b<a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>oth methodologies.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>these foundational concepts and Agile’s historical context prepares you to explore its practices and applications effectively. Next, we’ll discuss the importance of organizing work across multiple <span class="No-Break">small teams.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Harnessing the power of small, collaborative teams</h2>
			<p>Agile methodologies strongly advocate using small teams, typically composed of three to seven members, with a maximum limit of 9. This emphasis on small teams extends across <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>various business domains, including the organization of value streams, for <span class="No-Break">several reasons.</span></p>
			<p>Firstly, small teams have a clearer focus on their goals and a stronger sense of purpose, enabling them to effectively align their work toward shared common objectives. Small teams are renowned for their agility and making decisions swiftly and operating efficiently, thus adapting to changes in the market or evolving <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, small teams foster better communication among members, leading to open, transparent, and effective lines of communication. They tend to have more engaged employees who take the initiative and drive innovation. Collaboration and mutual support are facilitated within small teams, with members trusting each other readily and assisting one another <span class="No-Break">when needed.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, small teams can specialize in certain areas while ensuring they remain self-contained with all required skills in-house. This enhances accountability as everyone’s contributions are visible, leaving no room for favoritism or bureaucratic hurdles. If you need more pe<a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>ople, add more small teams and teach them how to synchronize and integrate their work. We’ll discuss this topic in more detail in <a href="B21818_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Implementing Basic Lean-Agile Solutions </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Teams (BLAST).</em></span></p>
			<p>We’ve completed our brief introduction to Lean and Agile concepts as separate strategies for productivity improvements and organizational agility. In the next section, we’ll start to bring them together as <span class="No-Break">complementary practices.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Combining Lean with Agile</h1>
			<p>As you explore the intricacies of Lean and Agile in this book, you’ll come to appreciate that each <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>methodology brings a distinct set of principles, practices, and advantages to the table. Across industries, Lean’s strength lies in its ability to reduce waste and optimize processes. Conversely, Agile applies an iterative development and incremental delivery process that emphasizes adaptability, flexibility, <span class="No-Break">and customer-centricity.</span></p>
			<p>But here’s where it becomes interesting. The true magic unfolds when you bring these two approaches together, as described<a id="_idTextAnchor050"/> in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h4>Living in a Lean-Agile house</h4>
			<p>So far, we have explored Lean and Agile principles and practices in isolation. Now, it’s time to <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>bring them together. To do that, we need <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>to grasp the characteristics that define a <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile enterprise.</span></p>
			<p>To kick off our introduction, we’ll explore our <strong class="bold">House of Lean-Agile</strong>, as depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>.

				<li><strong class="bold">Agile</strong> <strong class="bold">Manifesto</strong>: Marking a seismic shift in software development, the Agile Manifesto promoted flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity. In Lean-Agile houses, it serves as a guiding philosophy for iterative development, adaptive planning, and problem-solving, extending its applicability beyond software to any domain requiring agility <span class="No-Break">and innovation.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we’ll look at each of the three pillars supporting our <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile house.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Supporting pillars in our Lean-Agile house</h2>
			<p>While the <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>foundation provides the strength to uphold our Lean-Agile house, we require a framework to bolster the functionality of our organization. Our Lean-Agile house consists of three primary pillars for <span class="No-Break">this purpose.</span></p>
			<h3>Pillar 1 – respect for people</h3>
			<p>In the Lean-Agile enterprise, respecting people is more than a lofty ideal; it is a pivotal force <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>propelling organizations toward excellence. Respect for individuals and teams is critical because if they are unhappy, they may disengage, leave, or even sabotage the organization’s efforts. This fact underscores the significance of cultivating a culture of respect and recognition within Lean-Agile environments to ensure sustained productivity <span class="No-Break">and success.</span></p>
			<p>Fostering a work environment that values and respects every individual’s contribution is key to cultural change. It focuses on creating a positive, safe, and performance-driven culture where trust and respect form <span class="No-Break">the foundation.</span></p>
			<p>The following three areas are fundamental in demonstrating respect for people within the <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile organization:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Understand and respect others</strong>: Both Lean and Agile stress the importance of understanding and respecting others while fostering collaborative environments. Embracing diverse skills enriches teams, while detractors undermine value and hinder performance. Lean-Agile prioritizes lifelong learning, quality, and waste reduction for competitiveness, guided by continuous improvement and <span class="No-Break">customer-centricity principles.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Develop</strong> <strong class="bold">people</strong>: In Lean and Agile, developing people fosters continuous improvement and adaptability. Empowering individuals enhances problem-solving, innovation, and value delivery, enabling swift responses to change and success in dynamic environments. Individuals take responsibility for their development, encouraged by principles of continuous learning and personal growth, aligning with Agile’s collaborative, <span class="No-Break">iterative nature.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Foster trust and employee engagement</strong>: Trust and engagement are crucial in Lean-Agile, facilitating teamwork and innovation. Effective collaboration and change acceptance enhance productivity and satisfaction, while <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>engaged employees drive organizational goals and continuous improvement. This culture of empowerment, central to Lean-Agile, enables self-organized teams to deliver high value <span class="No-Break">to customers.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In conclusion, it should be evident that the value of respect extends beyond mere courtesy. It serves as a strategic core value in Lean-Agile organizations, cultivating an environment where continuous improvement and collaboration are encouraged and expected. Embracing respect as a core value is essential for any organization aspiring to thrive in today’s fast-paced, <span class="No-Break">ever-changing world.</span></p>
			<h3>Pillar 2 – optimize flow</h3>
			<p>Efficient flow is essential for any Lean-Agile organization striving to deliver value to its customers <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>effectively and continuously. In this subsection, we’ll explore the three key strategies for optimizing flow within the organization. By organizing around value, ensuring uninterrupted flow, and decentralizing execution, organizations can streamline their processes, reduce waste, and enhance <span class="No-Break">overall efficiency.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organize</strong> <strong class="bold">around</strong> <strong class="bold">value</strong>: Organizing operations around value entails aligning production resources according to value streams, mapping out workflows, and identifying areas for improvement to streamline processes and <span class="No-Break">enhance efficiency</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Make</strong> <strong class="bold">value</strong> <strong class="bold">flow</strong> <strong class="bold">without</strong> <strong class="bold">interruption</strong>: Adopting pull-oriented production control systems prevents excess work and bottlenecks while identifying and eliminating constraints ensures a steady flow of value by removing obstacles and avoiding <span class="No-Break">unnecessary work-in-progress</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Decentralize execution</strong>: Decentralizing decision-making empowers teams to respond swiftly to customer needs and market changes, fostering agility and adaptability to maintain an efficient flow <span class="No-Break">of value</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In conclusion, optimizing flow is integral to the Lean-Agile organization’s ability to deliver <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>value to customers efficiently and continuously. By organizing around value, ensuring uninterrupted flow, and decentralizing execution, organizations can streamline their processes, reduce waste, and enhance overall efficiency. Embracing these principles allows organizations to adapt and thrive in today’s dynamic and competitive <span class="No-Break">business environment.</span></p>
			<h3>Pillar 3 – continuously improve (Kaizen)</h3>
			<p>At the <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>heart of Lean-Agile philosophy lies the <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>commitment to continuous improvement, known as <strong class="bold">Kaizen</strong>. This section explores the principles of ongoing, iterative, and incremental development, which are central to driving organizational growth and success. By embracing the <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>concepts of <em class="italic">"Go and see" </em>(<strong class="bold">Gemba</strong>), iteratively improving, and enhancing productivity while reducing costs, organizations can continuously evolve and adapt to meet the ever-changing needs of customers <span class="No-Break">and markets.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Go and see (Gemba)</strong>: Gemba, or “Go and see,” underscores the importance of firsthand observation in understanding the work environment, identifying inefficiencies, and fostering collaboration with frontline workers to optimize workflows and <span class="No-Break">enhance productivity</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Iterative and incremental improvements</strong>: Lean-Agile philosophy embraces iterative improvement, encouraging small, incremental changes based on feedback and experimentation to adapt quickly to changing requirements and drive continuous innovation and <span class="No-Break">value delivery</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improve productivity and reduce cost</strong>: Lean-Agile organizations prioritize improving productivity and efficiency through process optimization, waste elimination, and non-value-adding cost reduction measures, enabling accelerated delivery of high-quality products and services while maximizing resource allocation and <span class="No-Break">maintaining competitiveness</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In conclusion, the commitment to continuous improvement, embodied by the principles of “Go and see” (Gemba), iterative improvement, and productivity enhancement through waste elimination, lies at the heart of the Lean-Agile philosophy.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Integrated practices for enhanced effectiveness</h2>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>subsection briefly introduces the importance of combining Lean and Agile, highlighting the intrinsic synergy that exists between these practices. While each methodology is robust in its own right, its integration elevates organizational effectiveness and respo<a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>nsiveness to new heights. It’s not about replacing one with the other; it’s about harnessing the strengths of both to create a harmonious and highly efficient culture within <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Introducing the BLAST and BASE frameworks for Lean-Agile transformation</h2>
			<p>Elevating your understanding of how to integrate Lean and Agile practices at both the team of teams and enterprise levels, we’ll introduce <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>two key strategies later in this book: BLAST <span class="No-Break">and BASE.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21818_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Implementing</em> <em class="italic">Basic</em> <em class="italic">Lean-Agile</em> <em class="italic">Solutions</em> <em class="italic">Teams</em> <em class="italic">(BLAST),</em> describes a framework designed to help organizations coordinate the activities of multiple teams involved in <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>product or service delivery, planning, or worki<a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>ng on resolving <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>a complex <span class="No-Break">business problem.</span></p>
			<p>These teams may employ both Lean or Agile practices as the situation demands, but the real essence of the BLAST framework lies in establishing a collaborative structure between multiple teams. Here, teams learn to work together seamlessly, driving continuous improvements to enhance the value generated through the organization’s products, services, and <span class="No-Break">business systems.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Defining a Business Agility System for the Enterprise (BASE), </em>is a conceptual model and pattern language that integrates Lean and Agile practices at the enterprise level, enabling organizations to integrate, coordinate, and synchronize work across the entire enterprise. By embracing BASE, businesses can foster continuous improvements across product life-cycles, delivering customer-centric solutions with agility <span class="No-Break">and innovation.</span></p>
			<p>BASE doesn’t add new roles or responsibilities. Instead, it provides a framework to align product development, delivery, and support activities to meet your customers’ needs. The goal is to simplify, creating a product life cycle model that largely maintains the organization’s existing roles and functions. However, the BASE framework integrates Lean and Agile principles to consistently deliver new value in a predictable <span class="No-Break">pattern repeatably.</span></p>
			<p>Since we’ve introduced the terms <em class="italic">framework</em> and <em class="italic">pattern</em> <em class="italic">languages</em>, let’s define them in the context of Lean-Agile principles <span class="No-Break">and practices.</span></p>
			<h3>Defining a Lean-Agile framework</h3>
			<p>A Lean-Agile <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>framework provides a structured and comprehensive set of guidelines, principles, and practices that provide a foundation for organizing work, decision-making, and processes within an organization. It typically offers a high-level structure that helps define roles, responsibilities, and the flow <span class="No-Break">of work.</span></p>
			<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>example, Lean-Agile frameworks, such as the <strong class="bold">Scaled</strong> <strong class="bold">Agile</strong> <strong class="bold">Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>), <strong class="bold">Disciplined Agile </strong>(<strong class="bold">DA</strong>), <strong class="bold">Scrum@Scale </strong>(<strong class="bold">S@S</strong>), <strong class="bold">NEXUS</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Large-Scale Scrum </strong>(<strong class="bold">LeSS</strong>), offer a structured approach to scaling <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>Agile practices <a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>across larger enterprises. Like BASE and <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>BLAST, these frameworks establish a common language and a <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>structured approach for teams to work together cohesively while adhering <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>to Lean and <span class="No-Break">Agile principles.</span></p>
			<p>However, BASE and BLAST differ in their ability to align the work of multiple Lean and Agile teams <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>to continuously deliver new increments of value following your organization’s unique business practices, roles, responsibilities, domains of knowledge, <span class="No-Break">and terms.</span></p>
			<h3>Defining a Lean-Agile pattern language</h3>
			<p>In our Lean-Agile methodology, a pattern language offers a carefully selected collection of proven <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>practices to tackle recurring challenges within specific contexts. It provides adaptable patterns, each containing practices aimed at addressing identified problems and leveraging <span class="No-Break">associated benefits.</span></p>
			<p>These context-specific patterns can be tailored to meet project, team, or organizational needs while maintaining alignment with Lean and <span class="No-Break">Agile principles.</span></p>
			<p>For example, BASE and BLAST provide structured approaches to delivering value increments through products and services, following a cadence of minimum valuable increments (MVIs) and minimum valuable releases (MVRs). These approaches can be tailored by organizations to fit their unique industry and <span class="No-Break">business requirements.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, while Lean-Agile frameworks offer top-down organization and scalability, pattern languages provide bottom-up flexibility and context-aware solutions. Both are invaluable in Lean- Agile, with frameworks offering structure and gu<a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>idance and pattern languages <span class="No-Break">providing adaptability.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s shift our focus to prioritizing improvement activities. Organizations must strategically allocate their limited resources to activities with the highest impact, a topic we’ll explore in the <span class="No-Break">next subsection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Avoiding local optimization with Value Stream Management (VSM)</h2>
			<p>VSM offers a strategic approach that avoids localized improvements by providing a comprehensive view of your organization’s product delivery process. The issue with focusing <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>on localized solutions is that they may not address the organization’s actual constraints and can have minimal <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>impact. By identifying and prioritizing <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>enhancement opportunities across all areas, you can avoid the common pitfalls of local optimization and significantly increase the value delivered <span class="No-Break">to customers.</span></p>
			<p>VSM provides a powerful framework for examining every aspect of the product life cycle, from concept to delivery. It aligns with the BASE model principles, enabling thorough workflow examination, bottleneck identification, and value creation assessment. Implementing VSM fosters cross-functional collaboration and informed decision-making, paving the way for <span class="No-Break">meaningful improvements.</span></p>
			<p>Before we get into the mechanics of implementing BASE (in <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>), <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"> 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Driving</em> <em class="italic">Improvements with</em> <em class="italic">Value</em> <em class="italic">Stream</em> <em class="italic">Management</em> <em class="italic">(VSM)</em>, will delve into practical implementation strategies for VSM. You’ll receive a step-by-step guid<a id="_idTextAnchor071"/><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>e to leveraging this methodology effectively, including techniques for identifying value streams, mapping them, and pinpointing areas for improvement. By that chapter’s end, you’ll possess the tools and knowledge necessary for informed decision-making that optimizes your organization’s capacity to <span class="No-Break">deliver value.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we understand the importance of integrating Lean and Agile principles for customer-oriented value improvements, let’s explore the cadence <span class="No-Break">of deliveries.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Creating a cadence of continuous value delivery</h2>
			<p>In <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Defining a Business Agility System for the Enterprise (BASE)</em>, we’ll learn <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>how to implement a cadence to ensure the regular delivery of new increments of value through products and <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>services. These increments, known as <strong class="bold">minimum valuable increments </strong>(<strong class="bold">MVIs</strong>), may contain improvements that enhance organizational flow or address critical business problems, <span class="No-Break">minimizing waste.</span></p>
			<p>Product enhancements and other business-oriented deliverables can be packaged and deployed within a single MVI, or multiple concurrent MVIs may be in flight - deployed as MVRs, each addressing different product and business needs. This flexibility distinguishes <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>the <strong class="bold">BASE framework</strong>, which allows standalone MVIs to be released independently <span class="No-Break">of others.</span></p>
			<p>The concept of MVIs came about as an expansion on the ideas of ‘minimum marketable product,’ a term coined by Mark Denne and Jane Cleland-Huang in their 2003 book Software by Numbers. The word <em class="italic">Valuable</em> is used instead of <em class="italic">marketable</em> since not all increments are marketed – many are used internally – and it a<a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>pplies equally to businesses and <span class="No-Break">government organizations.</span></p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>BASE conceptual model MVIs encompass a range of deliverables, including products, enhancements, and improvements to business functions and value streams. Each MVI requires a product owner or value manager to assess and guide release priorities based on value<a id="_idTextAnchor075"/> considerations, gathering input from <span class="No-Break">various stakeholders.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, we’ll explore how VSM provides the methods and tools necessary for making <span class="No-Break">value-based determi<a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>nations.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Unlocking value with Value Stream Management (VSM)</h1>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>section, we’ll briefly introduce the concepts behind VSM, a Lean-oriented practice that stands as a cornerstone in facilitating continuous and highly impactful improvements to enhance customer-centric value deliveries across <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>The evolving nature of VSM</h2>
			<p>A modern-day <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>definition of VSM, as highlighted in a Forbes Innovation article by Flint Brenton, describes it as an Agile business practice aimed at evaluating the worth of software development and delivery endeavors and resources.<span class="superscript">8</span> It’s important to recognize that VSM has been a key part of value stream improvement since the early 2000s, originating in non-IT domains. In this book, you will learn how to apply VSM methods and tools to enhance software development and also to optimize any value stream within <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Describing the VSM methodology</h2>
			<p>The concepts behind modern VSM prac<a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>tices originally evolved to support other domains than software. For example, you can find books on how to apply VSM as a method to assess value <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>stream improvement opportunities in supply chain management, manufacturing, healt<a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>h care, administration and to create Lean <span class="No-Break">office environments.</span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Driving Improvements with Value Stream Management (VSM),</em> we’ll introduce a common set of VSM steps to identify and prioritize your value stream improvement opportunities. These steps are depicted in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.4</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – Nine-step VSM methodology</p>
			<p>These nine steps can be applied in any value stream assessment, regardless of the type of business domain, industry, government, or no<a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>n-profit environment. The VSM process is <span class="No-Break">genuinely universal.</span></p>
			<p>So, whether you are in IT or any other business domain, you can apply these steps. In the next subsection that follows, you will find out where in this book you can learn more about the versatility <span class="No-Break">of VSM.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Unveiling the versatility of VSM</h2>
			<p>The versatility of VSM extends beyond software development or IT, offering valuable support <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>for enhancing value streams in various organizations. Understanding VSM practices is crucial for assessing high-impact improvement opportunities and aligning IT with broader <span class="No-Break">organizational enhancements.</span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B21818_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Establishing</em> <em class="italic">Lean</em> <em class="italic">Flows</em> <em class="italic">to</em> <em class="italic">Improve</em> <em class="italic">Productivity</em>, you’ll explore Lean-oriented production control systems, waste reduction, and constraint management strategies to improve flow across the organization’s value streams. Additionally, <a href="B21818_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a> highlights the significance of selecting appropriate metrics within integrated Lean-Agile practices. These insights pave the way for <em class="italic">Part 2,</em> <em class="italic">Attending to our Value Steams</em>, and specifically to <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Driving</em> <em class="italic">Improvements</em> <em class="italic">with</em> <em class="italic">Value</em> <em class="italic">Stream</em> <em class="italic">Management (VSM)</em>, which delves into evaluating value stream improvements and their impact on customers and businesses, equipping you with practical skills for <span class="No-Break">professional growth.</span></p>
			<p>While <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a> provides us with a basic understanding of foundational VSM concepts, there is so <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>much more to learn. For example, in <a href="B21818_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor329"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Navigating</em> <em class="italic">Value</em> <em class="italic">Stream</em> <em class="italic">Optimization,</em> we’ll learn the importance of shifting our<a id="_idTextAnchor084"/> mindsets from Projects to Products, and how to harness digital enhancements to support our business transformations. And, in <a href="B21818_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor355"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Connecting the Value Stream Network</em>, we’ll explore their role in optimizing value delivery capabilities within organizations. Through topics like mapping customer journeys and refining operations, <a href="B21818_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor355"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a> demonstrates how aligning value stream networks enhances overall organizational efficiency <span class="No-Break">and effectiveness.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you understand the breath and scope of VSM, let’s talk about some of its <span class="No-Break">core principles.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Enhancing professional expertise with VSM</h2>
			<p>Acquiring knowledge about VSM enhances your professional toolkit, encompassing skills such <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>as creating value stream maps, utilizing metrics for value assessments and productivity improvements, and establishing dedicated VSM <span class="No-Break">improvement teams.</span></p>
			<p>VSM is pivotal for identifying inefficiencies and improvement opportunities  within organizational value streams. By visually mapping value stream flows, VSM methods and tools help identify bottlenecks and areas misaligned with customer-<a id="_idTextAnchor086"/><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>centric goals. In addition to visualization, key metrics such as cycle time, lead time, throughput, work in progress (WIP), changeover time, and defect rate are essential for prioritizing <span class="No-Break">improvement opportunities.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, forming skilled and impartial VSM teams is crucial for driving continuous enhan<a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>cements across value streams, and maximizing <span class="No-Break">improvement impact.</span></p>
			<p>These teams serve as change catalysts, guiding organizations toward increased customer-centricity and value delivery. Moreover, they are the key to sustaining <span class="No-Break">organizational transformations.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Leveraging IT for Lean-Agile transformation</h1>
			<p>Leveraging IT is crucial in driving Lean-Agile improvements across the organization. Digital <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>enhancements play a pivotal role in enhancing business processes, products, and services. By focusing on IT, organizations can become leaner, imp<a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>roving productivity and efficiencies throughout <span class="No-Break">their operations.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, the IT organization supports business agility by providing the necessary information to adapt and evolve rapidly, supporting emergent business focuses, changing market dynamics, and evolving customer needs. In essence, IT acts as a catalyst for organizational transformation, enabling businesses to stay competitive and responsive in today’s <span class="No-Break">dynamic marketplace.</span></p>
			<p>But how do we determine the specific information required and its sources, as well as where to place our IT investment priorities? We’ll cover that topic in <a href="B21818_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor302"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Introducing the VSM Implementation</em> <em class="italic">Roadmap.</em> But let’s start with a quick introduction in the <span class="No-Break">next subsection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Investing in IT value stream improvements</h2>
			<p>Investing in IT value stream improvements is crucial given the significant impact of digital <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>enhancements on products, services, and critical business processes. To enhance productivity and efficiency within IT value streams, it’s essential to invest in appropriate tooling <span class="No-Break">and skills.</span></p>
			<p>In Lean, VSM has long been recognized as a proven method for identifying and prioritizing value stream improvement investments. Now, the IT community has embraced these concepts to drive enhancements across their DevOps-based software <span class="No-Break">delivery pipelines.</span></p>
			<p>Modern <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>IT VSM methods and tools provide a strategic framework for optimizing value stream processes, IT infrastructure, tooling, and software products. <a href="B21818_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor302"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing the VSM Implementation Roadmap</em>, delves into the <strong class="bold">Value Stream Management Consortium’s </strong>(<strong class="bold">VSMC’s</strong>) role in this effort, and its VSM implementation Roadmap, which is pivotal in <a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>advancing Lean-Agile and VSM concepts within the <span class="No-Break">DevOps community.</span></p>
			<p>DevOps emphasizes Lean-oriented flow strategies, improving value delivery by facilitating collaborations and integrating the work of development and operations teams. For a deeper understanding, Gary Rupp’s book <em class="italic">Driving DevOps with Value Stream</em> <em class="italic">Management</em> further explores DevOps’ significance, highlighting its reliance on <span class="No-Break">Lean principles.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">9</span></span></p>
			<p>With <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>modern VSM tools, DevOps-based software delivery pipelines are enhanced, offering visibility to identify bottlenecks and enhance collaboration. This enhanced visibility, combined with analytics capabilities, helps the IT department drive value across the organization, by aligning <em class="italic">their activities to support </em>other value stream <span class="No-Break">improvement initiatives.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Evaluating information requirements and flows</h2>
			<p>We now understand how DevOps pipelines with integrated VSM tools can help derive productivity and efficiency improvements in IT and provide visibility to align their work with <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>the organization’s priorities. However, to further that goal, we must also be able to understand how to improve decision making in a Lean-Agile enterprise. <a href="B21818_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor450"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Enhancing Decision Making in the Lean Agile Organization</em>, provides guidance on how to evaluate the questions and information that have the <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>most impact on driving business value. The core focus of this chapter is on teaching the BRIA process (short for Business, Role, Information, Action), a business intelligence framework that empowers you to define essential information needs. BRIA assists individuals at all levels of an organization in evaluating essential questio<a id="_idTextAnchor096"/><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>ns to determine the necessary data for creating informed decisions and taking <span class="No-Break">appropriate actions.</span></p>
