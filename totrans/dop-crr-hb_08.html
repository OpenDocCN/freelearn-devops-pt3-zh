			<p>In the field of <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong>, having a mentor will allow you to arrive at your career destination much quicker; it allows access to knowledge from someone who has been where you are. In this chapter, you will be given the motivation to find a mentor, along with the resources to find a mentor in a way that works with your personal preferences.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, the following topics will be covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The importance of mentorship</li>
				<li>The mentor-mentee relationship dynamic</li>
				<li>Choosing the correct mentor</li>
				<li>Mentors as references</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>The importance of mentorship</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will cover the benefits that a <strong class="bold">mentorship</strong> relationship can bring. This section will be broken<a id="_idIndexMarker354"/> down into four parts: the assistance and guidance toward setting achievable goals, career coaching, motivation, and career advice, as shown in the following diagram:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – The benefits of mentorship</p>
			<p>We will start by covering how a mentor can help you set, plan, and reach your goals.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Assistance and guidance toward setting achievable goals</h2>
			<p>A mentor is going to provide guidance<a id="_idIndexMarker355"/> on how to achieve your goals. A mentor will help you ensure your goals are achievable, using milestones. The following is a true story of how my mentor helped to lead me down a path unrelated to my goal, which ended up being exactly what I needed to succeed. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Real Experiences: From DevOps Engineer to Technical Agile Coach</p>
			<p class="callout">Leading a DevOps team had been my goal since starting a career in DevOps at <em class="italic">United Health Group</em>. My mentor helped surface the shortcomings that needed to be addressed if my goal was to become a reality. Presenting and demonstrating ideas to others had always been a struggle; also, being very timid and not great at voicing my opinion were all deficiencies I was unaware of until I had a candid goal-setting discussion with my mentor. </p>
			<p class="callout">The solution to overcome my shortcomings was transitioning from a behind-the-scenes technical individual to a coaching role. A technical coach's role was to help agile teams learn and adapt CICD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery)best practices; in other words, a lot of demonstrating and voicing my opinion was going to be required. </p>
			<p class="callout">The first portion of my transition included being immersed in the world of agile, along with having 1:1 coaching sessions with my mentor. One of my first teams I was assisting was not using a CI server, had not migrated their code into GitHub, and had no automated tests or regression tests in place. These were things I was comfortable doing in my sleep; however, my role was not doing the work but instead coaching and guiding the team in the correct direction. It was terrible; however, slowly over the course of the first sprint, I started becoming more comfortable with myself and the team. It became quite fun, and also, my mentor and supervisor told me I was quite good at it. </p>
			<p class="callout">My journey as a technical coach lasted for two years before transitioning into leading the DevOps <strong class="bold">Center of Excellence</strong> (<strong class="bold">COE</strong>). It wasn't until much later that my goal to become a people manager of a DevOps team become a reality. Without the direction of my mentor, I likely would not have developed the skills that I needed to lead a team, nor would I have discovered the passion I had for coaching and training, which was a direction I, ultimately, decided to pursue further.</p>
			<p>Often, a mentor is going to have an insight that you are unlikely to realize on your own. Before making any career-altering goals or changes, I encourage discussions with your mentor<a id="_idIndexMarker356"/> to get their input. If you have yet to find a mentor, continue reading this chapter for insights into finding one. Next, we will discuss the importance of coaching and training, which is another set of helpful skills a mentor offers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>The motivation to help you achieve your goals</h2>
			<p>After setting a goal, it quickly<a id="_idIndexMarker357"/> can become less enticing to work toward the goal due to the effort that is required. In situations such as this, a mentor will step in and reiterate why the destination is worth the effort. This is only possible if you and your mentor have a relationship that allows for open communications, that is, a relationship in which you feel comfortable discussing your doubts. </p>
			<p>Your mentor is your cheerleader<a id="_idIndexMarker358"/> who wants to see you achieve your goal. To ensure you stay on the correct path, set up regular coaching sessions to discuss your progress and work on unlocking and enhancing your skills. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Career coaching </h2>
			<p>Training is the transfer of knowledge<a id="_idIndexMarker359"/> from a mentor to a mentee, while coaching is used by mentors to enhance a specific skill of a mentee. In the coaching sessions that you have with your mentor, it is your responsibility to drive the conversation and discussion in the direction you would like to go. This means being open with your mentor; if you are struggling with a specific concept or method, make this known to your mentor.</p>
			<p>There are things that you need to bear in mind when being coached so that you do not get angry or become discouraged:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A coaching session is not the same as training; a mentor will not explain a specific concept or method to you. Instead, they will push you in a direction they feel will help you better understand a particular concept. </li>
				<li>A coaching session is about you the mentee. Asking the mentor what they would do in a particular situation will be turned back on you. Remember that this is about how you are going to become better, not how or what your mentor knows or thinks. </li>
				<li>If you walk away from a coaching session with more questions than answers, it was a success! Take the questions you have and turn them into answers for yourself.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next session, we will discuss how mentors are there when you need a trusted individual's opinion. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Useful advice</h2>
			<p>A mentor is there<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> when you need advice at any time. Whether it is about a project you are working on, or a general question about career progression, a mentor is there to help you traverse your career. Advice from a mentor is training in a less formal setting. When working on a project and an issue arises, your mentor might be the first person you message for their input. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip: Advice from a Mentor Is Continuous Training</p>
			<p class="callout">Each discussion you have with a mentor imparts a small piece of your mentor's knowledge onto you. When you ask for specific advice, it is like opening a mini training course from one of your most trusted publishers. Make sure you take full advantage of this opportunity if you get it.</p>
			<p>In this section, we discussed the importance of having a mentor. Unlocking the potential benefits described means you must build a strong relationship that is built on trust and respect with your mentor. The sooner you feel comfortable asking your mentor for advice, the sooner<a id="_idIndexMarker361"/> you can unlock the potential of a mentor-mentee relationship.</p>
			<p> In the next section, we will discuss the relationship dynamics between a mentor and mentee along with the various stages of the relationship. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>The mentor-mentee relationship dynamics</h1>
			<p>You get to choose your mentor; however, your mentor<a id="_idIndexMarker362"/> must also choose you as their mentee, which is what makes the relationship unique and powerful. There is a core set of skills that is shared between both a mentor and mentee, as shown in the following diagram: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer086" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.2.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – The mentoring skill model&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – The mentoring skill model</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Active listening</strong>, <strong class="bold">building trust</strong>, and <strong class="bold">goal setting</strong>; all three of these can be tied back to respect. A mentor must respect<a id="_idIndexMarker363"/> his mentee, and likewise, a mentee must respect his mentor. There are three stages to a mentor-mentee relationship. </p>
			<p>In the <em class="italic">first stage</em>, you begin seeking advice from someone you look up to. At this point, the specifics of the relationship have not been defined, and you officially do not have a mentor. At this stage, you are really testing the waters of someone you feel has the potential to be a good mentor. A good analogy for this is dating; you go on a date with someone you feel might be a good match for you before you ask the individual if they would like to become more serious.</p>
			<p>The <em class="italic">second stage</em> is when you <strong class="bold">define the relationship</strong> (<strong class="bold">DTR</strong>). In the second stage, you have officially<a id="_idIndexMarker364"/> asked someone to be your mentor, and they have agreed to your request. At this stage, you will likely have scheduled 1:1s and check-ins with one another.</p>
			<p>It is important that you do not become complacent<a id="_idIndexMarker365"/> during this stage of your relationship, as the relationship is fragile and its infancy, you want your mentor-mentee relationship to continue to grow and mature. The following is another example from my personal career where I made the mistake of allowing my mentor-mentee relationship to get stagnant in stage two.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Real Experiences: What a Mentor Relationship is Not</p>
			<p class="callout">Early in my career, I had several mentors I had officially asked to be my mentor. I got career advice from those individuals, and they provided me with guidance when I asked. The relationships were forced and awkward, which lead to very few 1:1 sessions and no coaching sessions. I was under the impression that this is just how mentor-mentee relationships were supposed to be. </p>
			<p>The problem experienced in the preceding example stemmed from a lack of knowledge and understanding of how mentor-mentee relationships work. The destination for a mentor-mentee relationship is one that is more like a friendship; this is the third stage.</p>
			<p>The <em class="italic">third stage</em> of a mentor-mentee relationship is where a strong bond grows between the mentor and the mentee. It is at this stage that trust enables the occurrence of effective coaching and 1:1 mentoring sessions. Depending on how deep your relationship with your mentor becomes, your mentor might begin considering you to be their protégé. </p>
			<p>The following diagram is a graphical representation of the three stages of mentorship:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer087" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.3.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – The stages of mentorship&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – The stages of mentorship</p>
			<p>In this section, we discussed the three stages<a id="_idIndexMarker366"/> of a mentor-mentee relationship and what to expect at each stage. You learned that you will not gain the full benefits of mentorship until you fully trust and respect one another. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we will discuss how to choose a mentor and the numerous factors that you need to consider when making your decision.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Choosing the correct mentor</h1>
			<p>Finding a mentor is challenging, but choosing<a id="_idIndexMarker367"/> the correct mentor is more challenging. A successful mentor will understand your goals, be someone you respec<a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>t and look up to, understand your current situation and abilities, and see potential in you. We will separate this section into two parts: the criteria for choosing a mentor and asking someone to be your mentor.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>Questions to ask when looking for a mentor</h2>
			<p>Let's take a visual look at the criteria<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> I have found to be the basis for finding a good mentor: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer088" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.4.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4 – Questions to help you determine whether you are choosing the correct mentor&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – Questions to help you determine whether you are choosing the correct mentor</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Is the individual an enabler of my short- and long-term goals?</em> As we approach finding the answer to this question, we uncover another question directing the focus on your goals, <em class="italic">what are my long- and short-term goals?</em> If you do not have this documented somewhere, don't worry, we will cover it now. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Activity: Writing Your Goals</p>
			<p class="callout">Grab any sheet of paper<a id="_idIndexMarker369"/> and split the page into four quadrants. Then, label each quadrant 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years. </p>
			<p class="callout">Next, grab some sticky notes and start adding your goals. Place the notes in one of the four quadrants.</p>
			<p class="callout">Once you have this done, you can create a final copy in a Google Doc or any other type of file.</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are comfortable, I recommend sharing this with your professional network or a subset of your network. We will come back to this point later. </p>
			<p>Now that you have your goals, look at the goals<a id="_idIndexMarker370"/> that are in your one-year and five-year quadrants. As you start identifying potential candidates, ask yourself what skills and expertise the individual has that will help develop the skills that are necessary to achieve your goals. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Is the individual aware of my current goals and capabilities?</em> This question is meant to access an individual's awareness of your current circumstances. It is more effective to have a mentor who has worked with you or interacted with you either virtually or in person at some point in the past. This is not to say you should disqualify anyone you have not had previous interactions with. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">If you have not had any previous interactions with an individual and still decide they are still a good fit as your mentor, you must be upfront with the additional time commitment involved in getting to know one another. This is a requirement for a fruitful mentor-mentee relationship.</p>
			<p>If you post your goals on LinkedIn, individuals should be aware of your goals if they follow you. In the following section, we will cover another way to present your goals to your mentor.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Is the individual someone I respect and look up to too?</em> This question contains two parts; both are critical if you wish to have a strong relationship with your mentor. You should eliminate anyone from your list who does not meet these criteria. It is not possible to have a mentor-mentee relationship with someone who you do not respect or someone you do not look up to.</p>
			<p>Use the following Venn diagram<a id="_idIndexMarker371"/> to determine whether someone should be considered as a potential mentor: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer089" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.5.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5 – A Venn diagram to decide whether someone is a potential candidate to be a mentor &#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – A Venn diagram to decide whether someone is a potential candidate to be a mentor </p>
			<p>In the next section, we will discuss the best way to officially ask an individual, who you have determined to be a good fit, to be your mentor.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>Asking an individual to be your mentor</h2>
			<p>If you are fortunate, asking<a id="_idIndexMarker372"/> your mentor will be a natural progression in your already existing relationship. If you work closely with the individual and you are already having regular career-related discussions, asking them to be a mentor should be easy. This is the candidate who lands in the center of the preceding Venn diagram, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.5</em>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">There is a difference between an internal sponsor and a mentor. An internal sponsor is someone<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> in your current organization who will help you with internal career progression. Interaction with a sponsor will likely end once you leave the organization that they are part of. A mentor will not be someone who will give you a job or get you a job; however, they will be part of your career journey in the long term. </p>
			<p class="callout">Often, having both a mentor and a sponsor is beneficial. A sponsor will give you advice and career opportunities that are relevant to your current employer. A mentor will give you more holistic advice that is unbiased to a specific employer. <em class="italic">Both</em> are good opinions to have; especially when your mentor's advice aligns with a sponsor's job opportunity!</p>
			<p>Most will not be so fortunate, and you will need to work a bit harder and move outside your comfort zone to land a great mentor. The following are several scenarios that you might find yourself in:</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scenario 1</strong>: A potential mentor is someone who you have worked with at a previous company, and you have stayed connected with on LinkedIn. This individual lands either in the center or in <strong class="bold">Zone A</strong> on the Venn diagram.</p>
			<p>In this case, you could send them an email. Here is one example:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Subject: Mentorship</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Hi [insert person's name],</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">During our time working together at [company] I was able to learn a lot and grow as an engineer. I have attached my career goals and feel with you as my mentor, we could further refine my goals and define a plan to help me achieve them. If being my mentor is something you would be open to, I would enjoy setting up an initial call to discuss. </em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Regards,</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">[Your name]</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scenario 2</strong>: A potential mentor<a id="_idIndexMarker374"/> is someone you met at a conference and have since been interacting with via LinkedIn. This individual lands in <strong class="bold">Zone A</strong> on the Venn diagram.</p>
			<p>In this case, you could send them a LinkedIn message. The following is one example:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Subject: Mentorship</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Hi [insert person's name],</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Since hearing you speak on [topic] at [conference or event], I have been following you on LinkedIn and respect your understanding of DevOps. I have come to a point in my career where I believe I need a mentor to achieve my goals. I believe with your support and mentorship, I could grow professionally and achieve my goals. If you are open to mentoring me, I would enjoy finding some time on your calendar to discuss. Initially, I believe we would need to discuss time commitments.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Regards,</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">[your name]</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scenario 3</strong>: A potential mentor is someone you have never met but have been following on LinkedIn. This individual lands in <strong class="bold">Zone A</strong> on the Venn diagram; the likelihood of getting a positive response is not high because you have never met or interacted with this individual.</p>
			<p>In this scenario, getting to know the individual on a more personal level would be the best approach. A person is far more likely to accept an invitation to be a mentor for someone they know personally. </p>
			<p>In this section, we covered the questions that you need to ask to find a good, potential, mentor. Additionally, you learned about the potential ways in which to request an individual to be your mentor. In the next section, we will discuss when it is appropriate to request a mentor to be a reference. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Additional ways to get connected with a mentor</h2>
			<p>It is not always a straightforward or easy task to find a mentor. You might have a tough time finding a mentor within your organization or even within your network of connections. This is more common than you think, and there is an entire business built around connecting individuals with mentors to help them succeed. Should you be interested in additional support in finding<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> a mentor, check out the sites listed here:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Mentors as a reference</h1>
			<p>You have a mentor, and are beginning <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>to apply for new roles, but is it appropriate to use your mentor as a reference? The answer is ambiguous, along with most of the things in this section, and should be based on your best judgment. There are a few questions that you can ask to make your decision easier.</p>
			<p>The following is a decision chart that will help you simplify your decision:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer090" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.6.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6 – The decision tree for &quot;should I use a mentor as a reference?&quot;&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – The decision tree for "should I use a mentor as a reference?"</p>
			<p>In the following portions<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> of this section, we will cover each of the four questions, starting with the most basic one: have you asked your mentor if you can use them as a reference?</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Have you asked your mentor to be a reference?</h2>
			<p>If you have not asked someone whether they are your mentor or otherwise, you can only use someone as a reference after you have asked them, and they have agreed. Using someone as a reference without their permission is unprofessional and can damage or ruin your relationship with your mentor. A mentor is going to be candid and honest with you. If they do not feel you are ready for a specific role, they would be placed in a tough position if they were asked to refer you for the job. If you ask them, this could lead to an amazing discussion and opportunity to grow from your mentor's insight. Although there is a chance they will decline, the odds are in your favor that they will gladly be your reference.</p>
			<p>After a mentor has agreed to be a mentor, you need to ask a second question: have you worked with your mentor in the past? </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Have you worked with the mentor?</h2>
			<p>If you have worked<a id="_idIndexMarker384"/> with your mentor, they will be aware of your skills. Also, the fact that they agreed to be a reference for the specific role shows they are confident you have in what it takes! </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pro Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">If you have asked your mentor to be a reference for a broad job search instead of a specific job, you could ask the mentor about the specific role. In this way, they are aware of the specific role, and it could open up some great conversations on ways to better prepare for your upcoming interview.</p>
			<p>If you have not worked with your mentor, you must ask another couple of questions to determine whether you should or should not use them as a reference. The first question you need to ask is whether your mentor has seen you use your skills.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>Has your mentor seen you use your skills? Are they confident about your skills required for the role?</h2>
			<p>Seeing your skills and abilities is important for a referee to give an accurate representation of your skills, abilities, and character in their reference. They could have participated in a pair programming exercise or were present at a presentation that you gave at a conference. If the individual has not seen your skills, personally, I would not use them as a reference; you should use your best judgment. If you are uncertain, have a conversation with your mentor. </p>
			<p>Next, you need to ask this question: is my mentor confident in the skills I require for the role? If you asked your mentor to be a reference for a specific role and they have agreed, you can assume they are confident in your abilities for the role and use them as a reference. On the other hand, if you asked your mentor whether you could use them as a reference in general, not for a specific role, you will need to access their confidence in your abilities for the role. The best option would be to discuss the specific role with your mentor and get their feedback on it.</p>
			<p>In this section, we covered the key questions you need to ask when deciding whether you should use a mentor as a reference. The most effective and sure way of determining whether to use your mentor as a reference is by discussing the specific ro<a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>le you are applying for.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, several topics on mentorship were covered, including the importance of mentorship, the relationship dynamics between a mentor and a mentee, how to find a mentor, and using a mentor as a reference. In <em class="italic">The importance of mentorship</em> section, we covered assistance and guidance on setting achievable goals, career coaching, motivation, and career advice. </p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">The mentor-mentee relationship dynamic</em> section, you learned how there are three stages of a mentor-mentee relationship. Stage 1 is where you have not officially asked someone to be your mentor, stage 2 is where you officially define the relationship and begin having official 1:1 sessions, and in stage 3, your relationship grows due to an increase in trust and respect for one another. It is at stage 3 where you are able to begin having more productive and fruitful discussions.</p>
			<p>Next, we discussed how to find and choose a mentor. In this section, we discussed three questions that you should ask to determine whether someone will make a good mentor. The three questions included <em class="italic">Is the individual an enabler of my short- and long-term goals?</em>, <em class="italic">Is the individual aware of my current goals and capabilities?</em>, and <em class="italic">Is the individual someone I respect and look up to?</em></p>
			<p>Finally, we discussed whether you should use a mentor as a reference; the key takeaway from this section is that you can always have a discussion with your mentor. However, if time does not allow this, there is a decision chart that can help you.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss how working with recruiters can increase your chances of landing an amazing DevOps job.</p>
