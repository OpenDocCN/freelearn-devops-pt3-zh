- en: Salesforce is the world’s leading enterprise systems platform. This is a position
    it has reached over the last decade, with its scope having grown from its roots
    in sales and customer service to encompass a wide range of business domains.

- en: However, as Salesforce has grown, so have the complexities of the technological
    environments that contain it. And with that growing complexity, a number of common
    mistakes have emerged that often end up derailing Salesforce projects in a number
    of interesting ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These mistakes are what we will learn to call anti-patterns and investigate
    in a structured manner in this book. There are quite a few books on Salesforce
    architecture already available on the market today, but they all approach the
    subject from a normative view, grounded in good practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we flip that perspective around. We look at bad practices that
    commonly occur in Salesforce projects, and that, in fact, can seem like a good
    idea at the time you make the decision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By doing that, we see what happens when things don’t go to plan – when you don’t
    make the right call, and your solution suffers as a consequence. That gives a
    great background for us to review key architectural concepts and good practices
    as they apply across a range of scenarios.

    the **Certified Technical Architect** ( **CTA** ) exam roadmap. That way, while
    all the information is based on real-world examples, you will also be able to
    directly apply it in your journey to becoming a CTA, should that be a path you
    are on or are considering.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B30991_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014) , *Why Do We Need to Understand
    Salesforce Anti-Patterns?* , starts by explaining what anti-patterns are by going
    through a number of different definitions and ways of looking at them. You will
    then learn how they can help you deepen your understanding of architecture by
    understanding how these common mistakes are made and how they can seem like a
    good idea at the time. We then finish the chapter by understanding the book and
    the ways in which you can approach the content.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B30991_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026) , *How to Keep Your System
    Architecture Clean* , guides you through common anti-patterns relating to the
    systems landscape, the mix of systems you use in your solution, and how they can
    be combined. We will start by looking at anti-patterns at the highest level that
    describe problems around the composition and scoping of systems. Then we will
    look at anti-patterns that create highly coupled and brittle system landscapes,
    after which we will look at anti-patterns around selecting the right systems to
    include. The chapter will end with a review of the key takeaways for real life
    and the CTA Review Board.'

    about Security* , includes anti-patterns related to securing your Salesforce org.
    It starts by reviewing a key anti-pattern around the shared security model that
    is integral to Salesforce. Then we will look at anti-patterns that can occur when
    you mistake other things for security. We will continue to look at how not to
    make a mess of your sharing model and once again finish up with a review of the
    takeaways.'

    , contains anti-patterns related to data architecture, modeling, and governance.
    We will start by looking at what goes wrong when you don’t design with Salesforce’s
    object model in mind. Then we will look at some of the common governance disasters
    that can happen around data. From there, we will look intently at data synchronization
    and the ways in which it can go wrong, and finish up with takeaways for life and
    the CTA Review Board.'

    Troubles* , covers anti-patterns related to your solution architecture. We will
    start by looking at anti-patterns related to your choice of solutions. Then we
    will look at things that can go wrong when you do functional design. Thirdly,
    we will look at some particular anti-patterns that affect customizations, first
    at the conceptual level and then at the code level. We will end the chapter by
    summarizing the key takeaways.'

    , looks at anti-patterns around your integrations with other systems. The first
    part of the chapter looks at anti-patterns around the integration landscape and
    integration patterns. The second part looks at what can go wrong in the design
    and use of interfaces, and the third zooms in on problems with particular integration
    styles such as event-based architectures and batch transfers. As always, we end
    the chapter by distilling the key takeaways.'

    Life Cycle from Going off Track* , looks at anti-patterns related to areas such
    as development process, governance, and DevOps. We will start by tackling a few
    significant process-level anti-patterns and then move on to a couple that deal
    with DevOps and packaging. Finally, we will tackle a common and very unfortunate
    anti-pattern related to testing. At the end of the chapter, we will summarize
    the key takeaways for real life and the CTA Review Board.'

    , deals with anti-patterns centered around the way you communicate architecture
    to different audiences. The first part relates to anti-patterns that relate to
    information control. Then we look at a few anti-patterns that relate to the clarity
    of your communication. Thirdly, we look at an anti-pattern specifically about
    the way you create architectural artifacts. As we’ve been doing all along, we
    will end the chapter by summarizing our key takeaways.'

    overview of the content of the book, including the overarching takeaways from
    the preceding chapters. It then explains how you can use the anti-pattern method
    and perspective in your own work to improve your architecture skills. Finally,
    it gives you pointers on how you can progress further in this direction.'
