- en: With regard to the second benefit, many services are based on Regions. This
    means that before you deploy a resource using that service, you will need to select
    the Region in which you want to deploy it. For example, if you wish to launch
    a new Windows-based virtual server (we call these **Elastic Compute Cloud** (**EC2**)
    instances on AWS), you will need to choose the Region in which you want to place
    it. In fact, with EC2 instances, you also need to specify the AZ within the Region
    where you want to launch the server. Let's look at AZs next.

  zh: 关于第二个好处，许多服务是基于区域的。这意味着在使用该服务部署资源之前，你需要选择要部署资源的区域。例如，如果你想启动一个新的基于Windows的虚拟服务器（我们称之为AWS上的**弹性计算云**（**EC2**）实例），你需要选择希望部署它的区域。事实上，对于EC2实例，你还需要指定在该区域内希望启动服务器的可用区。接下来，让我们了解可用区（AZs）。

  zh: 可用区（AZs）
- en: AZs are the logical and physical grouping of data centers within a given Region.
    Each Region will have two or more AZs, as mentioned earlier. An AZ is a logical
    representation of a metropolitan area where AWS has deployed one or more data-center
    facilities. These data centers will house hardware components such as servers,
    storage, and network equipment, all fitted with redundant power, connectivity,
    cooling, and security controls.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 可用区（AZs）是给定区域内数据中心的逻辑和物理分组。每个区域会有两个或更多的可用区，如前所述。可用区是AWS在一个大都市区内部署一个或多个数据中心设施的逻辑表示。这些数据中心将容纳硬件组件，如服务器、存储和网络设备，所有这些设备都配备了冗余电力、连接性、冷却和安全控制。
- en: The primary purpose of having multiple AZs is to offer customers the opportunity
    to build highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable solutions. This is made
    possible by the fact that the AZs within a Region are connected to each other
    over high-bandwidth, low-latency private metro-fiber links, delivering high throughput
    connections between the zones.
  id: totrans-40
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 拥有多个可用区（AZs）的主要目的是为客户提供构建高可用、容错和可扩展解决方案的机会。这是可能的，因为同一区域内的可用区通过高带宽、低延迟的私有光纤连接互联，从而提供区域间的高吞吐量连接。
- en: An important aspect of this configuration is that you can achieve synchronous
    replication between AZs. This means that you can deploy multiple copies/replicas
    of your application on servers across the AZs. If there is an outage at one of
    the AZs, you can continue to serve your customers from the replica workloads running
    in the other AZs.
  id: totrans-41

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这个配置的一个重要方面是，你可以在可用区之间实现同步复制。这意味着你可以在不同可用区的服务器上部署应用程序的多个副本/副本。如果某个可用区发生故障，你可以继续通过在其他可用区运行的副本工作负载为客户提供服务。
- en: In *Figure 2.3*, if there was an outage in AZ **A**, users' traffic would be
    directed only to the servers offering the exact same services in AZ **B**. The
    architecture is such that users will not be made aware of the outage, and this
    will improve the UX substantially.

  zh: 在*图 2.3*中，如果AZ **A**发生故障，用户的流量将仅被引导到AZ **B**中的服务器，这些服务器提供完全相同的服务。架构设计确保用户不会察觉到故障，从而显著改善用户体验（UX）。
- en: 'This is a viable design because we can place our replica application servers
    across multiple AZs and distribute end-user traffic across them using an Amazon
    **Elastic Load Balancer** (**ELB**). The ELB not only distributes user traffic

    sends traffic only if those servers are online and responding. We examine Amazon
    ELBs in detail later, in [*Chapter 9*](B17124_09_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor223),

- en: In addition to Regions and AZs, AWS also offers another type of hosting service,
    called edge locations. These edge locations also host the physical server infrastructure,
    massive amounts of storage devices, and high-bandwidth networking equipment. In
    addition, AWS edge computing services provide infrastructure and software that
    enable data to be processed and analyzed closer to the end customer. This includes
    deploying AWS-managed hardware and software to locations outside AWS data centers,
    and even onto customer-owned devices themselves.

  zh: 除了区域和可用区（AZs）之外，AWS还提供了另一种类型的托管服务，称为边缘位置。这些边缘位置同样托管着物理服务器基础设施、大量存储设备以及高带宽网络设备。此外，AWS的边缘计算服务提供了基础设施和软件，使得数据可以更接近最终客户进行处理和分析。这包括将AWS管理的硬件和软件部署到AWS数据中心以外的位置，甚至直接部署到客户自有的设备上。
- en: As discussed previously, most resources that you deploy on AWS are going to
    be Region-based. For example, an EC2 instance can be deployed in the North Virginia
    Region, within a specific AZ. Let's assume that the servers host media files and
    you want to distribute those files to your end users globally. For users based
    in Sydney, Australia, this would mean pulling these large media files across the
    public internet directly from the server located in the US, each time they make
    a request for those files.
  id: totrans-52
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如前所述，你在AWS上部署的大多数资源将是基于区域的。例如，一个EC2实例可以部署在北弗吉尼亚区域的一个特定可用区（AZ）。假设这些服务器托管媒体文件，并且你希望将这些文件全球分发给最终用户。对于位于澳大利亚悉尼的用户来说，这意味着每次请求这些文件时，都会直接通过公共互联网从位于美国的服务器获取这些大型媒体文件。
- en: With edge locations, you can cache frequently accessed files on servers located
    closer to those users based in Sydney. This means that the time it takes to download
    those frequently accessed files is drastically reduced, and this improves the
    UX significantly.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 通过边缘位置，你可以将频繁访问的文件缓存到靠近悉尼用户的服务器上。这意味着下载这些频繁访问的文件所需的时间大大缩短，从而显著提高用户体验。
- en: A prime tenant of edge location services is Amazon's CloudFront. This is a CDN
    service designed to help you create distribution points for your content. The
    distribution points are created at these edge locations in each Region, depending
    on your configuration. Your content is then cached at the edge location closest
    to the end users who attempt to access your content.

  zh: 边缘位置服务的一个重要组成部分是亚马逊的CloudFront。这是一个CDN服务，旨在帮助你为你的内容创建分发点。分发点将在每个区域的这些边缘位置创建，具体取决于你的配置。然后，你的内容将被缓存到最靠近最终用户的边缘位置，当他们尝试访问你的内容时。
- en: Edge locations do more than just cache content. For example, **Amazon Simple
    Storage Service** (**Amazon S3**) is an object-storage solution that allows you
    to create containers (we call them **buckets** in AWS) in each Region. You can
    upload any type of data to a bucket and store it. If you need to upload large
    files to a bucket anywhere in the world, you may experience high latency and lower
    throughput, as the data needs to traverse the public internet.

  zh: 边缘位置不仅仅是缓存内容。例如，**Amazon Simple Storage Service**（**Amazon S3**）是一个对象存储解决方案，允许你在每个区域创建容器（在AWS中我们称之为**桶**）。你可以将任何类型的数据上传到桶中并进行存储。如果你需要将大文件上传到全球任何地方的桶中，你可能会遇到高延迟和较低吞吐量的问题，因为数据需要通过公共互联网传输。
- en: Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a feature of Amazon S3 that allows you to
    upload your content to AWS buckets via these edge locations. Once your data reaches
    an edge location closer to you, it then traverses the AWS backbone network using
    high-speed links. This greatly improves the upload speed of your data to Amazon
    S3 buckets. You can actually test your upload transfer rates using a tool provided
    by AWS, which is available at [https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html](https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html).

- en: Edge locations do have some limitations in that their cache size will fill up
    over time, and to cater for new content, they will evict content not recently
    accessed. This would mean that the next time someone tries to access that particular
    piece of content, it will need to be retrieved from the original source. To help
    reduce the number of times this happens, AWS also offers *regional edge caches*,
    which we discuss next.
  id: totrans-62

  zh: 区域边缘缓存
- en: In addition to edge locations, we also have regional edge caches. Regional edge
    caches have more storage and offer large cache sizes. As you can imagine, edge
    location storage devices will contain massive amounts of cached content—these
    could be images, videos, documents, and so on. Their primary purpose is to store
    frequently accessed content. As content becomes stale, it is evicted from the
    cache to make room for newer content. This means that when some content is infrequently
    accessed, end users will again have to pull those files from the original server
    to access them.
  id: totrans-64

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 除了边缘位置，我们还有区域边缘缓存。区域边缘缓存具有更多存储空间，并提供更大的缓存容量。正如你想象的那样，边缘位置的存储设备将包含大量缓存内容——这些内容可能是图片、视频、文档等。它们的主要目的是存储频繁访问的内容。随着内容变得过时，它将从缓存中驱逐，以为更新的内容腾出空间。这意味着，当某些内容不常被访问时，最终用户将不得不再次从原始服务器中拉取这些文件才能访问它们。
- en: Regional edge caches are highly useful in such situations. There are far fewer
    regional edge caches than edge locations deployed across the globe, but they are

    contradictory to the logic given previously that a given service needs to obviously
    run from physical infrastructure located in each Region. While this is true, AWS

    discussed Service Health Dashboard, the PHD provides information on services that
    affect your resources and workloads. You can access the PHD once logged in to
    the AWS Management Console of your AWS Account. We look at how to create your
    AWS Account in [*Chapter 3*](B17124_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor050),

    compared regional services with global services, and examined the AWS Service
    Health Dashboard and the PHD. You should note that you must agree to certain terms
    and conditions before using any service on the AWS Platform. Specifically, you
    must follow the AWS AuP, which we take a look at next.

    account for your personal or business use, you must comply with the AWS AuP. This
    policy provides information on acceptable use of the services offered by AWS and
    describes prohibited uses. It is imperative that you adhere to the guidelines
    in the policy or you risk your account being suspended or terminated, which may
    well affect the workloads you deploy for your business.

    that, as the customer, you can choose which AWS Region to deploy your resources
    and applications in, and looked at the key factors that should be taken into consideration
    when choosing a specific Region.

    that offer high availability, fault-tolerance, and scalability options. Understanding
    which services are classified as global or regional is also critically important
    to your design architecture.

    of your cloud-application solutions. Edge locations and regional edge caches enable
    you to make your web applications' content and digital assets available to customers
    on a global scale via low-latency and high-speed network links. This is achieved
    by caching frequently accessed content locally at edge locations closer to the
    end users, substantially improving the UX in accessing that content.

    the key differences between them. Choosing the right support plan is vital to
    ensure that you get technical assistance when you need it most, depending on your
    specific use case. Furthermore, understanding the offering of each plan will allow
    you to decide how much support is going to cost your organization, enabling you
    to budget accordingly.

    to receive notifications and alerts of any AWS service outage or planned maintenance
    task that is likely to affect your workloads and applications. This will enable
    you to make proactive decisions as and when required.

    using an AWS account. An AWS account is required in order to consume its various
    services in a secure and isolated manner and it ensures that any workloads to
    deploy on AWS are not accessible to any other customers or entities—unless, of
    course, you grant such access.
