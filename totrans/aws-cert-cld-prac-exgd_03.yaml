    centers**. Within a given Region, these data centers are built such that small
    groups of the larger cluster are logically and physically separated from each
    other by a distance that falls within 100 **kilometers** (**km**) (60 miles) of
    each other. These logically and physically separated groups of data centers form
    what we call **Availability Zones** (**AZs**).

    Virginia Region.

    would be useful. Simply put, having multiple Regions across the globe will allow
    AWS to further entice customers in those locations to sign up for its services.
    However, this may lead to another question. If there is nothing to stop you from
    accessing the services in an AWS Region on the other side of the globe, why have
    so many? Read on to find out why.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With regard to the second benefit, many services are based on Regions. This
    means that before you deploy a resource using that service, you will need to select
    the Region in which you want to deploy it. For example, if you wish to launch
    a new Windows-based virtual server (we call these **Elastic Compute Cloud** (**EC2**)
    instances on AWS), you will need to choose the Region in which you want to place
    it. In fact, with EC2 instances, you also need to specify the AZ within the Region
    where you want to launch the server. Let's look at AZs next.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AZs are the logical and physical grouping of data centers within a given Region.
    Each Region will have two or more AZs, as mentioned earlier. An AZ is a logical
    representation of a metropolitan area where AWS has deployed one or more data-center
    facilities. These data centers will house hardware components such as servers,
    storage, and network equipment, all fitted with redundant power, connectivity,
    cooling, and security controls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary purpose of having multiple AZs is to offer customers the opportunity
    to build highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable solutions. This is made
    possible by the fact that the AZs within a Region are connected to each other
    over high-bandwidth, low-latency private metro-fiber links, delivering high throughput
    connections between the zones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An important aspect of this configuration is that you can achieve synchronous
    replication between AZs. This means that you can deploy multiple copies/replicas
    of your application on servers across the AZs. If there is an outage at one of
    the AZs, you can continue to serve your customers from the replica workloads running
    in the other AZs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In *Figure 2.3*, if there was an outage in AZ **A**, users' traffic would be
    directed only to the servers offering the exact same services in AZ **B**. The
    architecture is such that users will not be made aware of the outage, and this
    will improve the UX substantially.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to Regions and AZs, AWS also offers another type of hosting service,
    called edge locations. These edge locations also host the physical server infrastructure,
    massive amounts of storage devices, and high-bandwidth networking equipment. In
    addition, AWS edge computing services provide infrastructure and software that
    enable data to be processed and analyzed closer to the end customer. This includes
    deploying AWS-managed hardware and software to locations outside AWS data centers,
    and even onto customer-owned devices themselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As discussed previously, most resources that you deploy on AWS are going to
    be Region-based. For example, an EC2 instance can be deployed in the North Virginia
    Region, within a specific AZ. Let's assume that the servers host media files and
    you want to distribute those files to your end users globally. For users based
    in Sydney, Australia, this would mean pulling these large media files across the
    public internet directly from the server located in the US, each time they make
    a request for those files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With edge locations, you can cache frequently accessed files on servers located
    closer to those users based in Sydney. This means that the time it takes to download
    those frequently accessed files is drastically reduced, and this improves the
    UX significantly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A prime tenant of edge location services is Amazon's CloudFront. This is a CDN
    service designed to help you create distribution points for your content. The
    distribution points are created at these edge locations in each Region, depending
    on your configuration. Your content is then cached at the edge location closest
    to the end users who attempt to access your content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Edge locations do more than just cache content. For example, **Amazon Simple
    Storage Service** (**Amazon S3**) is an object-storage solution that allows you
    to create containers (we call them **buckets** in AWS) in each Region. You can
    upload any type of data to a bucket and store it. If you need to upload large
    files to a bucket anywhere in the world, you may experience high latency and lower
    throughput, as the data needs to traverse the public internet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a feature of Amazon S3 that allows you to
    upload your content to AWS buckets via these edge locations. Once your data reaches
    an edge location closer to you, it then traverses the AWS backbone network using
    high-speed links. This greatly improves the upload speed of your data to Amazon
    S3 buckets. You can actually test your upload transfer rates using a tool provided
    by AWS, which is available at [https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html](https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html).
    The tool will attempt to transfer a sample file from your browser (your location)
    to various Amazon S3 Regions and display transfer rates comparing transfer with
    AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration and without.

- en: Edge locations do have some limitations in that their cache size will fill up
    over time, and to cater for new content, they will evict content not recently
    accessed. This would mean that the next time someone tries to access that particular
    piece of content, it will need to be retrieved from the original source. To help
    reduce the number of times this happens, AWS also offers *regional edge caches*,
    which we discuss next.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to edge locations, we also have regional edge caches. Regional edge
    caches have more storage and offer large cache sizes. As you can imagine, edge
    location storage devices will contain massive amounts of cached content—these
    could be images, videos, documents, and so on. Their primary purpose is to store
    frequently accessed content. As content becomes stale, it is evicted from the
    cache to make room for newer content. This means that when some content is infrequently
    accessed, end users will again have to pull those files from the original server
    to access them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regional edge caches are highly useful in such situations. There are far fewer
    regional edge caches than edge locations deployed across the globe, but they are
    strategically placed. They offer additional storage and cache that will continue
    to hold the data not accessed frequently for a longer period of time than with
    standard edge locations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, regional edge caches will also evict data that is not being accessed,
    but in the interim period, if another end user on the other side of the globe
    makes a request for that same data, then the process repeats, whereby that data
    is then cached at an edge location closer to that specific user.

    are some services that fall under the category of global services. This may seem
    contradictory to the logic given previously that a given service needs to obviously
    run from physical infrastructure located in each Region. While this is true, AWS

    regardless of which Region you happen to be working in, you can directly access
    those global services from any location.

    to ensure that you have the correct level of support for your use case, while
    ensuring you manage your costs effectively.

    businesses, however, require varied levels of support, and at AWS, each customer
    is catered for. In addition to standard customer support services such as resolving
    issues with account setups or billing, AWS offers an extensive range of technical
    support to help clients adopt cloud technologies faster and more efficiently.

- en: Even if you have vast technical experience within your on-premises data centers,
    moving to the cloud requires learning a new set of skills, understanding how to
    architect solutions for the cloud, and being cost-effective at the same time.
    AWS hires and trains some of the best engineers, and their support team is highly
    proficient with the technologies they offer.

    sections.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of which support plan you ultimately decide to choose for your business,
    every account is subscribed to the Basic support plan. Now, before this piques
    your interest, I should point out that this plan does not come with *any real
    technical support*. The Basic support plan is completely free and offers customer
    support for any account-related issues such as bill payment or if you have issues
    logging in to your account. You also get access to publicly available documentation,
    whitepapers, and support forums. You can access the Basic support services via
    email, chat, and phone 24/7, and the phone support involves getting Amazon to
    call you on your landline or mobile—so, they pay the call charges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, you also get access to seven basic checks on the Trusted Advisor
    tool, which helps you to identify best practices for increasing performance and
    improving security. We will take a look at the Trusted Advisor tool in [*Chapter
    13*](B17124_13_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor317), *Management and Governance
    on AWS*. Finally, you also get alerts regarding interruptions to any AWS services
    that may impact your deployed resources via the **Personal Health Dashboard**
    (**PHD**). The PHD is discussed in detail in the [*Chapter 13*](B17124_13_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor317),
    *Management and Governance on AWS*, as well.

    or testing in AWS*; refer to [https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/)
    for more information. The Developer support plan is a cost-effective solution
    for getting support with non-production workloads. These are websites or applications
    that are still at the development stage and do not yet support any critical business
    requirement. If you are satisfied with periods of extended downtime for such workloads,
    the Developer support plan is offered at a very reasonable price.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you get technical support with the Developer support plan, it is limited
    to generic support primarily around technical configurations with AWS use cases,
    and the support team will not be able to discuss specific application-layer problems
    that you might be having. Support is also only available via email (no phone support
    is offered) during business hours, with access to Cloud Support associates. While
    you can raise an unlimited number of cases, the case severity and response times
    are *within 24 hours* for general guidance and *within 12 hours* for system-impaired
    issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with the Basic support plan, you only get access to the seven core checks
    on the AWS Trusted Advisor tool under the Developer support plan.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Business support plan is recommended for production environments and enables
    companies to get technical support with their workloads on AWS. Examples range
    from resolving an issue with an RDS database that may have failed, where you need
    to perform a restore from backup, to more complex troubleshooting issues and problem
    resolutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Business support plan offers full 24/7 support via email, chat, and telephone.
    Depending on the severity of the issue, different response times are offered.
    For example, if you have a production system that is down, you can expect support
    from a Cloud Support engineer within 1 hour. Also, unlike the Developer support
    plan, which offers more generic support covering typical AWS use cases, the Business
    support plan includes helping you troubleshoot interoperability issues between
    AWS resources and third-party software. The level of support offered is therefore
    contextual to your use case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For an additional cost, you also get access to AWS **Infrastructure Event Management**
    (**IEM**). This service offers guidance and operational support to help you with
    your project launch events or migration tasks. This includes evaluating your AWS
    environment readiness, identifying any potential risks and ways to mitigate them,
    followed by ongoing support during your actual launch, and a post-event review.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, the Business support plan also entitles you to receive a full set
    of AWS Trusted Advisor checks that allow you to cross-reference your workloads
    against best practices and receive recommendations across five categories: **Cost
    Optimization**, **Security**, **Fault Tolerance**, **Performance**, and **Service
    Limits**. We will discuss the key features of the AWS Trusted Advisor tool in
    the [*Chapter 13*](B17124_13_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor317), *Management
    and Governance on AWS.*'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Enterprise support plan is the *crème de la crème* of all the support plans
    on offer from AWS. You would expect the best level of service under this plan
    given its price tag, which starts at **US Dollars** (**USD**) $15,000 per month.
    The Enterprise support plan is naturally appropriate for very large organizations,
    such as multinational companies or companies that have extensively large workloads
    spread globally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examples of such companies include Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Dropbox. The Enterprise
    Support plan stands out because of its different VIP-style offerings such as a
    designated **Technical Account Manager** (**TAM**). Your TAM will actively monitor
    your environment and work closely with you to actively guide your team through
    planning, design, and implementation of your cloud projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your TAM will assist with optimization tasks and suggest various best-practice
    methodologies, and also provide access to the best experts within AWS. Another
    key offering is access to Well-Architected reviews. This allows you to get access
    to a senior AWS solutions architect who can conduct an audit of your solutions
    deployed on AWS. AWS will provide guidance and best practices to help you design
    reliable, scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    chat, and phone support, with access to senior cloud engineers and with a 15-minute
    response time for business-critical technical issues.

    the Enterprise support plan. A key difference between the plans is to know which
    plans offer 24/7 technical support via phone and chat and which do not. Additionally,
    not all plans give you full access to all Trusted Advisor reports that can help
    you ascertain whether your workloads and solutions follow best practices and security
    guidelines.

    compared regional services with global services, and examined the AWS Service
    Health Dashboard and the PHD. You should note that you must agree to certain terms
    and conditions before using any service on the AWS Platform. Specifically, you
    must follow the AWS AuP, which we take a look at next.

    account for your personal or business use, you must comply with the AWS AuP. This
    policy provides information on acceptable use of the services offered by AWS and
    describes prohibited uses. It is imperative that you adhere to the guidelines
    in the policy or you risk your account being suspended or terminated, which may
    well affect the workloads you deploy for your business.

    of your cloud-application solutions. Edge locations and regional edge caches enable
    you to make your web applications' content and digital assets available to customers
    on a global scale via low-latency and high-speed network links. This is achieved
    by caching frequently accessed content locally at edge locations closer to the
    end users, substantially improving the UX in accessing that content.
