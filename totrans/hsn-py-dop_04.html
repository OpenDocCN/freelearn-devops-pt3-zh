			<p class="author-quote">Life is chaotic, dangerous, and surprising. Buildings should reflect that.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Frank Gehry (famous architect)</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> is a game of resources. Of taking<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> the resources that you have and putting them in the right place. It sounds easy, but it is not. The acquisition of resources is based on several criteria and requirements that the DevOps engineer receives. If you want to optimally provision resources, then you<a id="_idTextAnchor079"/> have to understand the logic and reasoning behind provisioning those resources as well as the strategy behind the intended use of the <span class="No-Break">underlying infrastructure.</span></p>
			<p>And if you want all that in plain English: take only what <span class="No-Break">you need.</span></p>
			<p>So, that will be one of the underlying concepts of this chapter: rightsizing. <strong class="bold">Rightsizing</strong> is the art of finding <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>the optimal resource sizes for your application or workload. A lot of this is just trial and error (often yours, but someone else’s if you can get it) and trust me when I say this, it is much easier to do that programmatically than manually in the modern <span class="No-Break">DevOps landscape.</span></p>
			<p>But that’s easier said than done, because sometimes the load placed upon your resources is a lot larger than the size of the resources you’ve provisioned, especially if your application becomes popular. You become a victim of your own success. Or you provision resources that can hold at maximum capacity, but that capacity is only occasional, and you can’t possibly ramp your resources up <span class="No-Break">in time.</span></p>
			<p>This brings us to the second underlying<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> concept of this chapter: scaling. <strong class="bold">Scaling</strong> your resources up and down is one of the important aspects of DevOps and removing resources is as key an aspect of provisioning them as adding resources is. This must almost always be done programmatically, and we will look at a couple of ways in which Python can help us <span class="No-Break">with that.</span></p>
			<p>If you master these concepts and how to use them effectively, you can save you and your organization a massive amount of time, money, and resources. In addition to this, you will be able to deliver on spikes in demand in a way that addresses the needs of both your organization and <span class="No-Break">its customers.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will explore <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to provision virtual resources <span class="No-Break">with Python</span></li>
				<li>How to use Python SDKs for various clouds and provision resources <span class="No-Break">through them</span></li>
				<li>How scaling works, the types of scaling, and choosing the correct type <span class="No-Break">of scaling</span></li>
				<li>How containerization of resources can help with rightsizing and easier provisioning (and where Python plays <span class="No-Break">a role)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Here is a list of requirements that you will need to meet to complete the exercises in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Python installation with boto3, Kubernetes, and Docker <span class="No-Break">libraries installed</span></li>
				<li>An <span class="No-Break">AWS account</span></li>

				<li>A GitHub account, and basic knowledge of Git <span class="No-Break">and repositories</span></li>
				<li>Access to this book’s <span class="No-Break">repository: </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Python-for-DevOps"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Python-for-DevOps</span></a></li>
				<li>A basic understanding of virtualization <span class="No-Break">and Kubernetes</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Python SDKs (and why everyone uses them)</h1>
			<p>Let’s take it<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> from the top. <strong class="bold">SDKs</strong>, or <strong class="bold">software development kits</strong>, are official programming<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> libraries and <strong class="bold">CLIs</strong> released by a platform<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> that allows developers to develop tools and applications that leverage that platform. These SDKs are usually written in very popular lang<a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>uages so as to cover the largest number of <span class="No-Break">developers possible.</span></p>
			<p>The three major clouds (where the majority of DevOps work is done) have the following programming languages in common among them for SDKs: <strong class="bold">Java</strong>, <strong class="bold">.NET</strong>, <strong class="bold">C++</strong>, <strong class="bold">Go</strong>, <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong>/<strong class="bold">TypeScript</strong>/<strong class="bold">Node.js</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Python</strong>. If you work on one of these – and the chances that you do are greater than the chances that you don’t – you need to choose a <span class="No-Break">programming language.</span></p>
			<p>So, the question then becomes, why Python? Also, why are we asking this question four chapters into this book? Well, I’ll tell you. Python is the exact balance between loose and structured that is necessary to pull off a lot of <span class="No-Break">DevOps principles.</span></p>
			<p>Strictly typed languages such as Java, .NET, and C++ can be good for development, but they will produce awful results for the flexibility that is required of the modern DevOps work<a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>load. That being said, most clouds are built on these languages. But operating on them is a different game entirely. Think of these languages as the bones that provide sturdiness and Python as the joints that provide flexibility – they should be everywhere that <span class="No-Break">requires flexibility.</span></p>
			<p>Then, on the other end of the spectrum, you have that JavaScript trio. The reason they are sometimes unsuited for this – even though there is a massive amount of support for them from the major clouds – is the limitations and syntactic quirks that are natural to these languages. They aren’t meant to natively work this way and in addition to that, they are single-threaded and difficult to <span class="No-Break">operate concurrently.</span></p>
			<p>The primary competitor and, at times, cooperator to Python in this department is Go. And let me tell you, Go is good. A majority<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> of cloud-based tools such as <strong class="bold">Docker</strong> and <strong class="bold">Kubernetes</strong> are built in Go, and ones that<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> aren’t are usually built in Python. But Go is really the only other language that can go toe to toe with Python for how useful it is in DevOps. And I’m telling you this because much of what I’m going to work through in this chapter will involve<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> frameworks written in Go, such as <strong class="bold">Terraform</strong> <span class="No-Break">and Docker.</span></p>
			<p>With all of this information out of the way, let’s finally put the focus back on Python. Python is easygoing. It has variable assignment without strict data types, which is incredibly useful for loosely coupled services, a very common architectural choice. It has a big community and is almost always the first SDK offered by modern infrastructure providers. As mentioned previously in this section, Python can essentially enter into a symbiotic relationship with any framework written in any language. If there is a popular framework or tool, its Pythonic version will likely be well-maintained and <span class="No-Break">properly updated.</span></p>
			<p>That was a quick look at the importance<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> of and popularity of Python SDKs, now, we are now going to see an example of how Python SDKs can be used to <span class="No-Break">provision resources.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Creating an AWS EC2 instance with Python’s boto3 library</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Boto3</strong> – it’s a name you’ve probably heard<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> very often if you’ve worked<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> with AWS and<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/> Python. It is the SDK that contains nearly every major AWS service that is currently available <span class="No-Break">with Python.</span></p>
			<p>For this example, we are going to use Boto3 in a script that will provision an EC2 instance in your AWS account. It sounds simple, but there are still a lot of steps that you need to follow to make it happen, so let’s get started. We will now begin by first logging into our AWS account and searching for the Sagemaker service. Let’s dive <span class="No-Break">into it:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>For this exercise, we need a clean environment where we can write Python code but also configure permissions in a terminal. To do this, in my AWS account, I’m going to create something<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> else that we will use down the line: a <strong class="bold">Sagemaker</strong> notebook. A Sagemaker notebook is a Jupyter notebook service run on <span class="No-Break">AWS servers:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1 – Console to create a notebook instance in Amazon Sagemaker</p>
			<p class="list-inset">If you look at the breadcrumb<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> at the top, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> see that the path is <strong class="bold">Amazon Sagemaker</strong> -&gt; <strong class="bold">Notebook instances</strong> -&gt; <strong class="bold">Create </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">notebook instance</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Any smaller notebook is good. We’re using <strong class="bold">ml.t3.medium</strong> for <span class="No-Break">this exercise:</span></li>

					<img src="image/B21320_04_2.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – Created notebook"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.2 – Created notebook</p>
			<p class="list-inset">Once your notebook<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> is up and running, click on <strong class="bold">Open Jupyter</strong> to get to your <strong class="bold">Jupyter IDE</strong>. Now, the instance itself will have some AWS permissions because it is an AWS creation, but not enough to provision an EC2 programmatically. It will, however, come<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> pre-installed with boto3 and the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">AWS CLI</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="allout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="allout">If you don’t have them installed, install <strong class="sour e-inline">boto3</strong> with <strong class="sour e-inline">pip</strong> and the AWS CLI<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> through AWS’s official website <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html">(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html</a>), which contains installers for all <span class="No-Break">operating systems.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Now, let’s try and provision the EC2 with the pre-existing Sagemaker role that comes pre-assigned <span class="No-Break">to Sagemaker:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer049" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_04_3.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – Code to invoke boto3 API"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.3 – Code to invoke boto3 API</p>
			<p>It worked. But, as you see here, the Sagemaker instance already came pre-configured with a role that had EC2 access.. If that had not been the case, you would have had to give the role some permissions or use the AWS CLI to attach a role profile to the instance. But it worked, and that is great. You can view your EC2 instance in your <span class="No-Break">AWS console.</span></p>
			<p>However, there are a few things to <span class="No-Break">note here:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You always need to define an <strong class="sour e-inline">ImageID</strong> (AWS has a public catalog). The one I’m using is AWS’s proprietary <span class="No-Break">Linux version.</span></li>
				<li>You need to define the instance size and the maximum and minimum number of instances <span class="No-Break">to create.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, that was simple and easy to understand, wasn’t it? Well, that’s good. Now we can move on to the concepts that make the provisioning<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> of resources so necessary. Scaling and autoscaling are essential concepts<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> in DevOps and they are both just a matter of <span class="No-Break">provisioning resources.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Scaling and autoscaling</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scaling</strong> is the act of increasing or decreasing<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> the size of a workload or resource depending on the demand for it. <strong class="bold">Autoscaling</strong> is doing this automatically based <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>on some sort <span class="No-Break">of trigger.</span></p>
			<p>As is often the case with workloads and applications, you can become a victim of your own success. The more your application succeeds, the greater the strain on it due to demand from users or services. To manage this strain often requires limitations placed on access to your application. You should do this if you don’t want to get overwhelmed with requests, trust me, because someone will try to do exactly that. But you should also have provisions in your infrastructure that can help it grow naturally with your growing <span class="No-Break">user base.</span></p>
			<p>That is where scaling comes in. Scaling can be done either vertically (adding greater computing power to a device) or horizontally (adding more computers). When performing one powerful act, vertical scaling is ideal and when processing a greater number of requests, you’ll need horizontal scaling. Most DevOps workloads require the latter over <span class="No-Break">the former.</span></p>
			<p>We will now explore the different types of scaling based on how hands-on you have to be with the workload that you are scaling. We will start with manual scaling and slowly escalate toward a more <span class="No-Break">automated approach.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Manual scaling with Python</h2>
			<p>Before we dive into<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> autoscaling, let’s just look<a id="_idIndexMarker152"/> at some regular scaling (done with Python, of course). We will vertically scale an instance manually using Python’s SDK for AWS. I will be using just my regular local IDE. But you can do this with any combination of Python, AWS CLI, and an AWS account. So, let’s head into the steps you would need to take to manually scale an EC2 instance using <span class="No-Break">Python scripts:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Here is the code to create an EC2 instance (this will be up in the book’s repository <span class="No-Break">as well):</span></li>

			<ol>
				<li value="3">Now, let’s write the code to modify the instance into a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="sour e-inline">t2.micro</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> instance:</span></li>

			<ol>
				<li value="4">So, once you restart the instance, it will have that extra <span class="No-Break">power available.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may have noticed that this is a slog. And vertical<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> scaling is – more often than not – a slog<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> of downtime. While there are use cases for things like these (especially when you need to work with bigger individual machines), it’s not the norm. Usually, horizontal autoscaling is better for your use case because of the lesser amount of downtime associated with the process. We’ll dive into <span class="No-Break">that now.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Autoscaling with Python based on a trigger</h2>
			<p>Autoscaling requires automating<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> the process of incre<a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>asing<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> the available compute resources according to some sort of metric or statistic. In order to autoscale, we need to design a mechanism that will trigger our SDK call once a certain metric or threshold has <span class="No-Break">been reached.</span></p>
			<p>Understand <a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>that looking at this particular example from a singular cloud perspective may make it seem a little impractical because most cloud platforms have in-built autoscaling. The key here lies in fine-tuning that <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>autoscaling. I’m going to create an <strong class="bold">autoscaling group</strong> and define the thresholds for scaling using a Python script. Then, I’m going to modify those thresholds and I will tell you the significance of why after I have <span class="No-Break">done it.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s write a basic script to make<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> an autoscaling group and put a threshold<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> on it using a policy for CPU utilization. We’ll go step-by-step from the launch configuration to the autoscaling group to the rule by which the instances <span class="No-Break">will autoscale:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we write the code to create a launch configuration that all machines in the autoscaling group <span class="No-Break">will follow:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_04_11.jpg" alt="Figure 4.11 – Code to create a launch configuration"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.11 – Code to create a launch configuration</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Next, we create the autoscaling group, which uses the launch configuration that we <span class="No-Break">created previously:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_04_12.jpg" alt="Figure 4.12 – Code to create an autoscaling group"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.12 – Code to create an autoscaling group</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Finally, we will create a policy that will scale the group upward if CPU utilization is greater <span class="No-Break">than 70%:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_04_13.jpg" alt="Figure 4.13 – Code to create a scaling policy"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.13 – Code to create a scaling policy</p>
			<p>Running all of these will give you a basic autoscaling group of virtual machines with these specifications. Now, you may be asking yourself where Python helps with this autoscaling. Well, for that, you first have to look at the metrics produced by these <span class="No-Break">virtual machines.</span></p>
			<p>If you look through the metrics<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> that are produced by the VMs, you’ll be able to find their CPU<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> utilization metrics, which can be exported. Using these metrics, you can calculate the average utilization of CPUs over a period of time (that programming language Python helps, I’m told), then use that data to find a better autoscaling target. To modify the target, you can simply use the same code as before with a different <span class="No-Break">metric value:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21320_04_14.jpg" alt="Figure 4.14 – Code for modified scaling policy"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.14 – Code for modified scaling policy</p>
			<p>Your findings on the data may even reveal that there is a better metric to use for your workload than CPU utilization. You can modify that here <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>This type of scaling is very useful<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> and there are a lot of situations where you definitely<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> will use these. However, this isn’t the only way to implement scaling and virtualization. In the next section, we will explore containers and their roles and purpose in the field of scaling <span class="No-Break">and virtualization.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Containers and where Python fits in with containers</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Containers</strong> are small packages of software<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> that serve as a unique runtime containing all of the necessary resources to run a small facet of an application, or sometimes the entire <span class="No-Break">application itself.</span></p>
			<p>The containers themselves are written in Go, as is the container orchestration service, Kubernetes. Those parts do not require Python unless the application code itself is written in Python. Where Python comes in handy is as the glue between the various containerized services. Orchestrating the orchestration, if <span class="No-Break">you will.</span></p>
			<p>Now, we are going to learn about the role that Python plays in the overall container picture. Python, as always, has a lot of libraries that support the use of containers and Kubernetes, and we will explore some of these libraries and how using Python can simplify your DevOps work where these important infrastructural elements <span class="No-Break">are concerned.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Simplifying Docker administration with Python</h2>
			<p>Keeping Docker images together<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> and organized is tricky. It’s why they invented<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> Kubernetes. But Kubernetes itself is tricky. This leaves <span class="No-Break">two gaps:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>First, when there are multiple Docker images but complete orchestration with Kubernetes is <span class="No-Break">not required</span></li>
				<li>Second, when Kubernetes APIs need to be frequently called or the cluster needs to be <span class="No-Break">frequently updated</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>For both of these purposes, Python can be a useful tool. Remember this is about support, not refact<a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>oring. We’re the auxiliary <span class="No-Break">player here.</span></p>
			<p>So, in this section, we will look at an example of how to use Python to administer <span class="No-Break">multiple containers.</span></p>
			<p>We will write a script to get a specific Docker image and create a container for it. This script can be <a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>rerun to do the same thing over and over again. You may also use the <strong class="sour e-inline">restart</strong> command if a container malfunctions. Now let’s look at the code to pull Docker images and start <span class="No-Break">a container:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.15 – Code to pull Docker images and start a container</p>
			<p>It’s simple, but that’s the key to it. Its simplicity provides building blocks to <span class="No-Break">improve upon.</span></p>
			<p>But even if we keep it simple, sometimes<a id="_idIndexMarker169"/> the use of containers gets<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> complex, which is where Kubernetes comes in. With Kubernetes comes its own challenges. These challenges can also be simplified and managed <span class="No-Break">using Python.</span></p>

			<p>There will come a time<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/> in your container <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>usage when Kubernetes will be the way that you need to go. At this time, Python can help as well. Python can help simplify a lot of Kubernetes administration tasks and since most Kubernetes workloads are run on the cloud, th<a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>ose SDKs are going to come in pretty handy <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>I’m only going to include one example, which will consist of the manipulation of Kubernetes namespaces. Just to be safe, we don’t want to crash and burn with computing resources yet, especially if you are new <span class="No-Break">to Kubernetes.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Namespaces</strong> are abstractions within a Kubernetes cluster<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/> that are used to divide computer resources based on certain criteria. A criterion can be environment (dev, production, etc.), network restrictions, or based on resource quotas available to <span class="No-Break">a namespace.</span></p>
			<p>You can use Python to create<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> and modify namespaces and manipulate <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>the resources within them. Let’s look at the steps to initialize a Kubernetes cluster and manage it <span class="No-Break">using Python:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, you will need to install Kubernetes with <strong class="sour e-inline">pip</strong> using the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="sour e- ode"><strong class="bold">pip install kubernetes</strong></pre></li>
				<li>Next, let’s write a script to create a few namespaces in our cluster. We can add resources to these <span class="No-Break">namespaces later:</span></li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.16 – Code to create Kubernetes namespaces from a list</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Now, let’s write a policy for these namespaces and implement them <span class="No-Break">into Kubernetes:</span></li>
			</ol>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.17 – Creating a policy for namespaces for implementation</p>
			<p class="list-inset">This will create policies for both namespaces, which will block external traffic from outside the namespace. As you can see here, we’ve implemented the same formatted policy to both namespaces using an iterator. This is but one of the ways you can automate in Kubernetes <span class="No-Break">using Python.</span></p>
			<p>Eventually, you can automate<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> these steps to the point where it will be possible<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> for you to simply list out and visualize your Kubernetes cluster and press a couple of buttons to adjust it to your needs. Everything else, the cluster will take <span class="No-Break">care of.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter sent us on quite a trip in terms of how we use Python. We figured out how SDKs work, what advantages they have, and why Python is so useful to have in the world of SDK use. You can literally build applications on top of applications, I’ve <span class="No-Break">seen it.</span></p>
			<p>We also learned about scaling and how much of a hassle that is because of the balance you have to strike between availability and cost. Here, we also found use for Python and its great SDKs and data processing abilities, helping us strike <span class="No-Break">that balance.</span></p>
			<p>Containers are also greatly supported by Python libraries, which can help act as a glue filler in the gaps between Docker and Kubernetes. We learned about the assisting role that Python plays in the management of <span class="No-Break">these services.</span></p>
			<p>So, in conclusion, in this chapter you have learned quite a bit about Python’s SDKs, using them for autoscaling, rightsizing, and containers. In the next chapter, we will take a closer look at how Python can be used to manipulate and interact with already <span class="No-Break">provisioned resources.</span></p>
