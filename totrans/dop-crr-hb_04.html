			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Chapter 3</em>: Specialized Skills for Advanced DevOps Practitioners</h1>
			<p>As DevOps engineers progress in their career-specific areas, they may stand out either as a result of their natural ability or skills or on account of their strong liking for the subject. This leads DevOps engineers down a specialized career path. The focus of this chapter will be on the skills required for entry into different DevOps specialties.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Mid–Senior Level Content</p>
			<p class="callout">This chapter is full of useful information for anyone interested in the field of DevOps; however, it is geared for DevOps engineers who have been practicing for a minimum of 1-3 years. This chapter assumes that individuals already have the knowledge listed in the previous chapter.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, the following specialized DevOps competencies will be covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>CI/CD pipeline DevOps engineer</li>
				<li>Infrastructure as code</li>
				<li>Cloud and application modernization</li>
				<li>Containers and container management</li>
				<li>Security</li>
				<li>Advanced DevOps certifications</li>
				<li>Competency matrix</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>CI/CD pipeline DevOps engineer</h1>
			<p>A CI/CD pipeline<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> DevOps engineer is responsible for the end-to-end automation of the developer's code through to production. The strategy developed by the CI/CD engineer is a central focus for a company's DevOps roadmap. Revisiting the infinite DevOps loop from the previous chapter, you are reminded that all stages of DevOps are included in the CI/CD cycle, as seen in the following diagram:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Infinite DevOps cycle</p>
			<p>One of the most in-demand skills for a CI/CD DevOps engineer is the ability to create, maintain, and promote the adoption of a shared pipeline library.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Maintaining a shared pipeline library</h2>
			<p>The CI/CD pipeline <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>engineer will maintain the shared pipeline library and all the standards and practices that are associated with the CI tools for every stage of the DevOps life cycle.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">CI Tool Management</p>
			<p class="callout">Depending on the size of the company, responsibility for CI tool management may fall on the pipeline engineer; for this book, we will cover tool management in the <em class="italic">Cloud and application modernization</em> section.</p>
			<p>To maintain the shared pipeline, DevOps engineers must have an expert-level understanding of the pipeline tools and pipeline architecture. Maintaining the shared pipeline library also involves managing and maintaining an inner-sourced project. As innovative ideas are proposed to be added to the pipeline, it is the role of the <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>DevOps engineer to ensure it is implemented correctly.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Definition: Inner Source</p>
			<p class="callout">Inner source is the use of open source software development best practices and the establishment of an open source-like culture within organizations for the development of its non-open source and/or proprietary software.</p>
			<p>The following diagram is a graphical representation of how a shared pipeline library could work:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer049" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.2_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Shared pipeline library&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – Shared pipeline library</p>
			<p>A lot is going on in the preceding diagram; first, we have a shared pipeline library that has different component modules in it that can be used by various products. We have a developer who developed some new functionality that they thought would be useful for the rest of the company, so they <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/><a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>opened a pull request, which needs to be reviewed by the CI/CD DevOps engineer before it officially becomes part of the library. Lastly, you can see two distinct products using components of the shared library in their own pipelines. </p>
			<h3>Ownership of integrations with the pipeline</h3>
			<p>A DevOps pipeline engineer <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/><a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>needs to have a vast knowledge of tooling at all stages of the pipeline. The following diagram shows many of the tools available at various stages of the pipeline:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer050" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.3_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – CI/CD tools&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – CI/CD tools</p>
			<p>The preceding diagram is meant to demonstrate the vast number of tools available at each stage of the CI pipeline. A valuable resource that allows you to view and examine each tool is digital.ai's periodic table of DevOps tools (<a href="https://digital.ai/periodic-table-of-devops-tools">https://digital.ai/periodic-table-of-devops-tools</a>).</p>
			<p>The CI/CD DevOps engineer is responsible for ensuring that the various tools can be integrated into the company's pipeline. Modules for connecting to the tool's API must be developed and then the solution must <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/><a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>be presented to a security review to ensure that it meets companies' standards. Once it is part of the pipeline, the CI/CD engineer is responsible for ongoing support of the various integrations as the tool's version and API changes.</p>
			<p>In this section, you learned that a CI/CD DevOps engineer must be knowledgeable in all phases of the CI/CD life cycle and have an understanding of the various tools used in each of the stages.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will cover the skills required to be successful as a DevOps infrastructure engineer.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Infrastructure as code </h1>
			<p>A DevOps infrastructure engineer is <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/><a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>responsible for provisioning, managing, and maintaining the infrastructure used within a company's various applications. Oftentimes, referred to as the <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong> engineer, the IaC engineer works closely with the architects and must have good relationships with many diverse groups. In this section, we will cover the skills required to be successful as a DevOps IaC engineer as well as the tools you will need to have a deep understanding of the role.</p>
			<h3>Network infrastructure design</h3>
			<p>DevOps IaC engineers partner closely<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/><a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> with architects and, in some cases, play the role of the architect for many projects.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Network Infrastructure Design: Definition</p>
			<p class="callout">Network infrastructure design is a process comprising network synthesis, topological design, and network realization, aimed at ensuring that a network or service meets the needs of the operator and subscriber.</p>
			<h3>Storage management</h3>
			<p>DevOps IaC engineers need to be<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/><a id="_idIndexMarker152"/> knowledgeable on the broad topic of storage management and optimization. Storage management covers volume migration, process automation, disaster and recovery, replication, auto-provisioning, snapshot and mirroring, storage virtualization, and compression.</p>
			<h3>Containerization (Docker and Kubernetes)</h3>
			<p>DevOps engineers need to be<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/><a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> familiar with containers; however, DevOps engineers specializing in infrastructure management will need to be comfortable with the orchestration and management of large Docker and Kubernetes clusters. Tools such as Terraform and Ansible can be used to help with this.</p>
			<p>The topic of containerization will be covered in much more detail in the <em class="italic">Containers and container management</em> section of this chapter.</p>
			<h3>Site Reliability Engineering</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Site Reliability Engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>) focuses on system<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/><a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> availability and reliability and was coined by Ben Treynor of Google in 2003. The goal of SRE is the same as DevOps – to bridge the gap between development and operations. If you <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/><a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>work for a large organization, SRE and DevOps will be separate entities on account of their goal and focus; however, the skills required for both SRE and a DevOps engineer focused on infrastructure will be remarkably similar. SRE has a focus on keeping systems running and available while DevOps aims to reduce the time to market and allow for rapid changes. In the following diagram, the items that should account for the most time are the foundation of the SRE hierarchy:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer051" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.4_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – SRE hierarchy&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – SRE hierarchy</p>
			<p>The preceding diagram illustrates how the foundation of SRE is a proactive, monitoring-based approach, followed by quick and thorough incident response and detailed <em class="italic">no-blame</em> postmortems. The idea behind <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/><a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>SRE is to find and remediate problems quickly, followed by changes to avoid the same issue in the future.</p>
			<p>In this section, we scratched the surface of a deep and interesting subject. If you are interested in learning more about SRE, you should take a look at the book on SRE published by Google: <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/">https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/</a>. In the last section of this chapter, we will list several certifications that will apply to a role in SRE.</p>
			<p>In this section, you learned what is required to be a DevOps engineer specializing in infrastructure. You need skills in network design, storage management, SRE, and containerization.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will cover the skills required by a DevOps engineer who specializes in cloud and application modernization.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Cloud and application modernization</h1>
			<p>In this section, you will learn about <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/><a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>cloud and application modernization, and the special role that exists for DevOps engineers in this <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/><a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>space. First, we will cover the advanced cloud knowledge required, followed by cloud modernization techniques.</p>
			<p>DevOps leaders need to adjust to a new demand for updated services while maintaining, operating, and improving their existing application portfolios. This new demand comes from modern technology, which is being introduced with increasing frequency. There are many application modernization approaches (including rehost, replatform, and replace) with different purposes, effects, values, costs, risks, and impacts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Advanced cloud skills</h2>
			<p>To be a DevOps cloud engineer, you <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/><a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>must have strong scripting skills in addition to an in-depth understanding of cloud platforms. You need to understand how different cloud products function and work together. The following diagram contains something that comes in handy if you are working in an area that has a multi-cloud environment:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer052" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.5_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – Cloud provider comparison&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Cloud provider comparison</p>
			<p>I am very comfortable with Amazon terminology; when I needed to work in GCP, it was handy to have a cheat sheet nearby. The methodology is the same; the terminology is vastly different across cloud providers.</p>
			<p>Another thing that DevOps cloud engineers need to be capable of is provisioning and deploying to cloud resources; this is another thing that varies greatly between different cloud providers. Understanding the cloud provider CLI is also very important as a DevOps engineer. You will rarely interact with<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/><a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> resources via the <strong class="bold">graphical user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUI</strong>); instead, you will use the CLI tool or API to make calls to various cloud offerings. The following links relate to the documentation pertaining to the various cloud CLI tools:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>GCP: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk&#13;">https://cloud.google.com/sdk</a></li>
				<li>AWS: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/&#13;">https://aws.amazon.com/cli/</a></li>
				<li>Azure: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli&#13;">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next section, we will go through another aspect of cloud specialty – application modernization. The topic is dense and there is no effective way to get good at it without practicing it; however, Gardner provides some useful resources for individuals looking to learn more.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Application modernization</h2>
			<p>As a DevOps engineer who specializes in <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/><a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>cloud and application modernization, evaluating the driving force behind the need for modernization is crucial. The driving force can be broken down into the demand and supply sides:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Supply side</strong>:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Fit</strong>: Lacking the ability to implement new requirements</li><li><strong class="bold">Value</strong>: Lacking in terms of the value, quality of support, and information it provides</li><li><strong class="bold">Agility</strong>: Lacking the ability to make changes quickly with an acceptable level of risk</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Demand side</strong>:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Cost</strong>: The cost of ownership is high in relation to the value it provides.</li><li><strong class="bold">Complexity</strong>: Complexity causes maintainability and increases risk when making changes.</li><li><strong class="bold">Risk</strong>: Security, compliance, supportability, or scalability risk.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>After a DevOps engineer has gone through and evaluated the system and determined the issue, the causes must be identified.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Choosing a modernization approach</h2>
			<p>The cause for<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/><a id="_idIndexMarker172"/> modernization can be broken down into three main categories: functionality, technology, and architecture. Once the cause is determined, the DevOps engineer must decide on the best approach for modernization. The following is a diagram showing the different modernization approaches with respect to their effort and complexity:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.6_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – Gartner's modernization approaches' ability to remediate the cause&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – Gartner's modernization approaches' ability to remediate the cause</p>
			<p>As a DevOps engineer who specializes in cloud and application modernization, you will be required to have an in-depth understanding of different modernization approaches. Gartner published an article, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-25RJ3RG2&amp;ct=210408&amp;st=sb">https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-25RJ3RG2&amp;ct=210408&amp;st=sb</a>, which covers in detail each of the aforementioned approaches.</p>
			<p>In this section, we covered the skills required for a DevOps engineer specializing in application modernization as well as the cloud. A DevOps engineer specializing in the cloud must be extremely comfortable provisioning and deploying to cloud applications. DevOps engineers will need to have a strong understanding of the cloud API and CLI functionality as well as understanding how cloud offerings compare to other cloud providers. Additionally, DevOps engineers specializing in the cloud may be required to aid in application modernization projects.</p>
			<p>In the next section, I will discuss the skills required to be successful as a DevOps engineer specializing in containers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Containers and container management</h1>
			<p>Container management, orchestration, and maintenance<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/><a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> are skills all DevOps engineers must be competent in; however, with cloud-native Kubernetes and other cloud orchestration tools, it has quickly become a specialty field. In this chapter, we will cover the skills required to succeed as a DevOps engineer specializing in container management. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">What It Takes to Be a Container Specialist</p>
			<p class="callout">The ability to pioneer, adopt, and <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/><a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>own new container methodologies is the one skill that separates a generalist from a container management specialist.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Container management software</h2>
			<p>DevOps engineers who specialize in <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/><a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>containerization must be highly skilled in container management software. The most widely used software for container management include Docker and Kubernetes. The purpose of <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/><a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>container management software is fivefold; automation, monitoring, security, scaling, and deployment for containers. We will cover the automation aspect first:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Container automation</strong>: The automation of container orchestration encompasses and covers monitoring, security, scaling, and deployment at an elevated level. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring</strong>: Containers require <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/><a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>monitoring, such as liveliness probes, which are tied to monitoring dashboards and alarms that can be used to spot and remediate problems sooner. There are several tools that can be used for monitoring, including Prometheus, Dynatrace, and Datadog.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: Container security is <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/><a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>the most critical concern for a DevOps engineer as the entire application is exposed if the container is compromised. To ensure that your container ecosystem is secure, first ensure that the base images being used are secure. Make sure the container images are signed from trusted sources, that the runtime operating system layer is up to date, and ensure that you have a patching strategy in place to update the image. Next, you need to ensure that your images are stored in a secure location with policy-based authentication to reduce the chance of human errors being introduced into the containers. Integrating security testing and scans and automating the deployment process is another way to mitigate risk. Tools such as Twistlock can help with this. Scanning the container allows for containers to be rebuilt and redeployed instead of trying to patch running containers. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scaling</strong>: Containers, by design, are immutable, which means that code cannot be changed following deployment. A benefit of <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/><a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>containers is that with proper configuration and monitoring, scaling the number of instances of a certain component up or down is an easy task. The hard part is determining the limits for when such scaling should occur.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This section described what is required to be a DevOps engineer who specializes in containers. In the conclusion to this section, I leave you with a few hands-on tutorials I used while learning Kubernetes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Kubernetes the hard way: <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way&#13;">https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way</a></li>
				<li>Kubernetes training course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/">https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next section, we will cover what is required to succeed in the field of DevSecOps, or, in other words, a DevOps engineer specializing in security.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Security</h1>
			<p>A DevOps engineer who <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/><a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>specializes in security is often referred to as a DevSecOps engineer. DevSecOps engineers have a deep understanding of the CI/CD process as well.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Security Is Everyone's Responsibility </p>
			<p class="callout">Security is everyone's job. Anyone who has any stake in delivering the software has a role in ensuring the application's security.</p>
			<p>The job of a DevOps security engineer is to ensure that security is built in and included from the onset of a project.</p>
			<p>DevOps engineers specializing in security have responsibilities that are broken down into two areas: CI/CD processes and environment and data. We will first look at CI/CD process security and the skills required to implement it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>CI/CD process security</h2>
			<p>Let's revisit the pipeline discussed earlier; numbers <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/><a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>have been added to the following diagram to correlate to the following security items:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Container scanning</strong> (<em class="italic">1</em>): Container scanning<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/><a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> should be added to the process of bringing new containers into your registry. Tools such as Twistlock are commonly used. The most popular container scanning tool is Twistlock; however, there are many others as well and these can be seen here: <a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/17-open-source-container-security-tools">https://techbeacon.com/security/17-open-source-container-security-tools</a>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security testing</strong> (<em class="italic">2</em>): This includes<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/><a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> running <strong class="bold">security static analysis testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAST</strong>) tools as part of builds, as well as scanning any<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/><a id="_idIndexMarker196"/> pre-built container images for known security vulnerabilities as they are pulled into the build pipeline. In the following example, the libraries are part of the compliance module. Many tools exist, both open source and paid, when it comes to SAST tools.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security acceptance testing</strong> (<em class="italic">3</em>): This type <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/><a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>of testing is known as <strong class="bold">dynamic application security testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAST</strong>). The purpose<a id="_idIndexMarker199"/><a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> is to test for security vulnerabilities dynamically while the application is running. A comprehensive tools list in this category can be found here: <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools">https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools</a>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Patching and security updates</strong> (<em class="italic">4</em>): Patching and security updates should have a pipeline so that they can run automatically and at<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/><a id="_idIndexMarker202"/> a scheduled cadence. The tools that can be used vary greatly. In my experience, the best patching tool is sometimes a simple script executed in a pipeline. Do your own research and form your own opinions.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Configuration management</strong> (<em class="italic">5</em>): The purpose of this is to ensure that all infrastructure follows company <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/><a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>security and compliance policies. Oftentimes, this is run when infrastructure is provisioned or after config changes have been applied.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer054" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – CI/CD security</p>
			<p>Integrating security into CI/CD pipelines is tricky as it requires domain knowledge as well as tool-specific knowledge and an understanding of industry security best practices. One article that helped me better understand compliance pipelines can be found at the following link: <a href="https://itrevolution.com/book/devops-automated-governance-reference-architecture/">https://itrevolution.com/book/devops-automated-governance-reference-architecture/</a>. In the next section, we will cover the areas DevSecOps engineers need to focus on to ensure environment and data security.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Environment and data security</h1>
			<p>The various environments and associated data are a company's most precious and vulnerable assets if not protected correctly. It is the DevOps engineer's job to ensure the best practices are implemented in an automated and scalable fashion. The following are a few concepts that will help drive further research on the topic:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Principle of least trust and zero trust</strong>: Processes and applications are granted the minimum access they require to operate properly. It sounds simple but it is quite a large undertaking as each <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>account needs to be audited to ensure it has correct access. The principle of least privilege is a core part of the zero-trust model; however, the zero-trust model is more comprehensive and is more stringent. Also, zero trust is more complicated to implement and maintain as many more access policies are needed. The following diagram shows the three principles of zero trust; verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer055" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.8_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8 – Zero-trust principles&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8 – Zero-trust principles</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Principle of isolation</strong>: The principle of isolation applies to containers running in a microservices architecture. The<a id="_idIndexMarker206"/><a id="_idIndexMarker207"/> principle of isolation has several components, including isolation of state, isolation of space, isolation of time, and isolation of failure.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data encryption</strong>: A container<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/><a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> orchestration platform with integrated security features helps minimize the chance of unauthorized access.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Secure API gateways</strong>: Secure APIs increase<a id="_idIndexMarker210"/><a id="_idIndexMarker211"/> authorization and routing visibility. By reducing exposed APIs, organizations can reduce attack surfaces.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Advanced DevOps certifications</h1>
			<p>As you progress as a DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/><a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>engineer, the number of certifications available to you increases as well. Certifications are rarely required to get a job in a specialized DevOps role, but they do offer a quick picture of the skills and expertise you possess as well as showing your dedication to your industry.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>AWS certifications</h2>
			<p>AWS offers several advanced certifications<a id="_idIndexMarker214"/><a id="_idIndexMarker215"/> based on what career track you are on. Most advanced AWS certifications require a minimum requirement of possessing the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. The<a id="_idIndexMarker216"/><a id="_idIndexMarker217"/> following is a list of the certifications offered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">AWS Certified Solutions </strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker218"/><a id="_idIndexMarker219"/></strong><strong class="bold">Architect – Professional</strong> (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/</a>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">AWS Certified</strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker220"/><a id="_idIndexMarker221"/></strong><strong class="bold"> DevOps Engineer – Professional</strong> (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/</a>)</li>

			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Google Cloud certifications</h2>
			<p>Google offers several<a id="_idIndexMarker224"/><a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> advanced certifications <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/><a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>related to DevOps depending on what specialty you are interested in. The following is a list of the certifications offered:</p>

			<p>In the next section, we will look at a skills matrix for DevOps engineers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Competency matrix</h1>
			<p>A competency matrix is a visual <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/><a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>diagram or chart that shows the skills and education required for separate roles within a company. Before we dive into competency matrix definitions, a few things need to be understood.</p>
			<p>First, not all organizations use a competency matrix to hire and promote employees, and second, each organization that does use it will have different requirements.</p>
			<p>The reason it was decided to have a section on competency is that every company has differing competencies tied to distinct levels. What this means is that a senior DevOps engineer at company X may map to a DevOps engineer at Google. This caused me anxiety and frustration early in my career. I hope this section can give you enough clarity on the correlation between level, competency, and pay.</p>
			<p>The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to the concept of a competency matrix as well as adding another tool to track your progress as your skills increase. We will start by breaking down the competency matrix.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Matrix breakdown</h2>
			<p>A competency matrix is broken <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/><a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>down into three main sections: <strong class="bold">skills</strong>, <strong class="bold">levels</strong>, and <strong class="bold">competency</strong>.</p>
			<div>

			<p>First, we will cover the skills section.</p>
			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>The skills section is usually<a id="_idIndexMarker250"/><a id="_idIndexMarker251"/> on the vertical (<em class="italic">y</em>) axis of the chart. The skills can be as granular or as broad as a company sees fit. The skills represented on the diagram will be specific for the department you are part of, so it is best practice to stay updated and current on your department's competency matrix if it exists. Next, we will discuss the horizontal axis of the matrix.</p>
			<h3>Levels</h3>
			<p>The level is located on the horizontal (<em class="italic">x</em>) axis of the chart. Levels differ from one company to the next. I currently work for an<a id="_idIndexMarker252"/><a id="_idIndexMarker253"/> organization where all individual contributors are mapped to different associate levels. If you were to work at Google, your role is mapped to L1 through L11 where an engineer is an L3, and a senior Google fellow is an L11. Levels without being mapped to competency are nothing more than a meaningless term. Unfortunately, levels are not universal, and you will need to investigate how your current skills map over if you decide to pursue a career outside your current organization. If you are interested in learning <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/><a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>more about levels at different companies, a valuable resource is levels.fyi: <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">https://www.levels.fyi/</a>. Next, we will discuss competency.</p>
			<h3>Competency</h3>
			<p>Competency is defined as the <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/><a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>ability to do something successfully. Competency is found at the crossroads of levels and skills on the graph. Each level has different criteria for success for each skill, meaning success is relative to the level you are at. It is becoming increasingly common for companies to adopt competency bands within each level. The purpose of this is to provide entry competency, desired competency, and sometimes premium competency:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Entry</strong> competency is the <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/><a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>minimum competency for a given skill to be considered for a role at the given level. If you are in the minimum category across the board, your chances of landing a job are not great. However, if there are only a few areas where you are in the minimum range, they can be a talking point when you are being interviewed of things you are working to improve on.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Desired</strong> competency is the<a id="_idIndexMarker260"/><a id="_idIndexMarker261"/> competency of about 50% of individuals in the level or, more simply, the competency the hiring team is hoping to find. The ideal situation for a hiring manager is that they find a candidate with desired qualifications across the board.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Premium</strong> competency is the point where<a id="_idIndexMarker262"/><a id="_idIndexMarker263"/> there begins to be a lot of creep between the current level and the next level up. If you are in the premium band for several skill areas, you are ready to be promoted to the next level.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following diagram shows that competency overlap exists between levels. This feature is built to allow fluid movement between levels:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.11_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11 – Competency matrix levels&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11 – Competency matrix levels</p>
			<p>Your pay range is bound by your level, but within a level, skill competency determines where you land within the range. This is discussed in detail in the following section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Compensation in relation to level and competency</h2>
			<p>Compensation is <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/><a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>bound by pay bands that are tied to the various levels within the company. The pay bands for distinct levels overlap; this means that a senior associate could potentially earn a higher base salary than a lead associate. The following diagram does an excellent job graphically of depicting this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.12_B18117.jpg" alt="Figure 3.12 – Compensation – Level graph&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.12 – Compensation – Level graph</p>
			<p>In an effort to normalize pay within <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/><a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>each level, managers are often told to target a specific percentile within each pay band. This is useful information when looking at job postings that have pay ranges. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned the skills required for DevOps specialist roles, including as a CI/CD pipeline specialist, infrastructure specialist, cloud and application modernization specialist, container specialist, and security specialist. The main takeaway from this chapter is that DevOps specialties take practice and dedication to hone your skills. We also discussed the competency matrix and how it translates to different pay grades.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will cover how to rebrand yourself online.</p>
