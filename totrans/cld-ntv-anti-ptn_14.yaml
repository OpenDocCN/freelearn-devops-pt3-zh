- en: Underestimating the cultural impact and learning curve of a cloud native and
    DevSecOps transformation is also a trap that can impact all areas, from strategy
    to security, compliance, data quality, operational complexity, and so on. A common

- en: A lack of standardization of building blocks and operational procedures is a
    red flag that we can easily see. Inconsistency will increase technical debt operational
    complexity, decreasing resilience and a self-service experience that helps us
    achieve fast release cycles. Giveaways for this anti-pattern include a lack of
    a service catalog or opinionated CI/CD pipelines, little changes that take a considerable

    data consistency, and non-functional requirements. The same is the case when we

- en: If developers accidentally delete instances, containers, or databases or manually
    create certificates or secrets, that is a sign that we have an immature CI/CD
    pipeline and do not have sufficient guardrails in place. It also means we are
    not enforcing the principle of least privilege and must set up the required permission
    scans to scale back permissions accordingly. We discussed these in *Chapters 5*

  zh: 如果开发人员不小心删除实例、容器或数据库，或者手动创建证书或密钥，这表明我们拥有一个不成熟的CI/CD管道，且没有足够的防护措施。这也意味着我们没有强制执行最小权限原则，必须设置所需的权限扫描，以相应地缩减权限。我们在*第5章*和*第6章*中讨论了这些内容。
- en: If we heavily rely on penetration tests before a go-live and severe findings
    are identified in an audit, then we lack a continuous assurance process, which

- en: If we don’t have good test coverage, we will either have outages or our testers
    will become a bottleneck when we try to achieve fast release cycles. To leverage
    all the cloud benefits, we need functional and non-functional tests embedded in
    our pipelines. This includes contract tests, performance tests, and security tests
    such as secrets scanning and vulnerability scanning. We explored those test types

- en: If our cloud strategy has not been updated over a year or our actions are not
    aligned with the strategy’s articulated goals, then we have a problem. It means
    we are either heading in the wrong direction or don’t even know which direction
    our organization should take. If priorities change frequently during a sprint,
    that is also a giveaway for reactive behavior, and we explored this anti-pattern
    remediation in [*Chapter 2*](B22364_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055).

- en: If we rely on a very decentralized governance model that does not allow for
    team autonomy, we cannot scale our business sufficiently, and we probably struggle
    to meet our customer needs. On the other hand, if we do not have any governance
    in place, we will struggle with compliance, reliability, self-service experience,
    and other challenges. A red flag is if our implementations do not reflect security
    policies and compliance requirements. We will need the right balance of guardrails,
    cultural transformation, and training, which we explored in [*Chapter 3*](B22364_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085).

- en: If we lack cost accountability and do not have a mature charge-back model in
    place, then there is no incentive for the product teams to optimize their cloud
    value. The result will be resource underutilization, a lack of cost-related architecture

- en: Stateful applications often indicate that we have been carrying technical debt
    for a while and have not refreshed our architecture. That could be due to a technical
    limitation of a **custom off-the-shelf** (**COTS**) product or because we have
    not allocated enough time to improving our architecture continuously. Stateful
    applications will hold us back when adopting cloud native features such as FaaS,
    blue-green deployments, and auto-scaling. We explored this in [*Chapter 7*](B22364_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor198).

  zh: 有状态的应用通常表明我们已经背负了一段时间的技术债务，并且没有刷新架构。这可能是由于**定制现成**(**COTS**)产品的技术限制，或者因为我们没有持续为改进架构分配足够的时间。有状态的应用在采用云原生功能（如
    FaaS、蓝绿部署和自动扩展）时会拖慢进度。我们在[*第7章*](B22364_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor198)中探讨了这一点。
- en: When we use tight coupling in our application, we cause long waiting times and
    also burn through compute and data expenses due to increased CPU, memory, or function
    call times. Mechanisms such as asynchronous calls and using queues mean we can
    decouple our architecture and scale more efficiently. We discussed this in [*Chapter

- en: 'The triangle represents the key factors that impact a project’s success: **scope**,
    **time**, and **cost**. It shows that changes in one constraint will affect the
    others. For example, increasing a project’s scope will likely require more time
    and money. We have to balance these constraints to meet project goals while maintaining
    quality. The triangle emphasizes that optimizing all three aspects simultaneously
    is challenging, which creates the need for trade-offs. These are the steps that
    will help us articulate the helicopter view:'

    Therefore, we need to pick some focus areas to start with. This will later help
    us limit the scope to address cost and time constraints. Internal and external
    factors can drive the priorities of our focus areas. Internal examples are an
    unreliable environment or immature DevSecOps practices. External factors may be
    a new regulatory framework we must address or a recent data breach. Depending
    on the severity of the driver, we need to choose our focus areas. We probably
    also want to balance strategic uplifts with quick wins to gain momentum.

    will create more logs, such as audit logs. We will need to ingest those logs,
    and there might be a license impact, or we might need to upgrade our storage.
    The cost of logging is often underestimated, and it is worthwhile to look into
    current log volumes. A multi-region deployment will also incur cross-region data
    transfer fees, which we must consider. We will also need more TLS certificates.
    We will incur increased expenses if we acquire them from a third party. We need
    to capture those downstream impacts for the total cost because we need those numbers
    to create the business case document. If our new solution is successful, it will
    likely lead to increased traffic, and our infrastructure will need to scale out
    more. This will lead to increased data transfer fees and additional costs for
    our infrastructure resources, which we discussed in [*Chapter 4*](B22364_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112).

    security or compliance segregation enough? These gaps will hold us back, and they
    will either slow down delivery timelines or increase the overall risk. Therefore,
    we should remediate them, as we discussed in [*Chapter 4*](B22364_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112),

    where we provide all the context. This will be a short refresher on the initiative,
    previous estimates, and new findings since the initial effort estimate. We will
    need to spend some time on the findings because any new internal or external findings
    can impact the effort estimates. The team can then go back to the initial estimates
    and add them. Now is the time to add a column to the initial time estimate to
    capture the job function(s) that should perform a particular task. This will help
    us validate whether we have all the necessary skills and resources. The outcome

    whether there is a perfect time is that it depends, but the best thing is to be
    prepared and be well-connected to stakeholders.

    case before and are not fully aware of the process, we need to engage with our
    manager or a peer contact who has done it before. They can provide some coaching
    and point us to the individuals running the governance forums who will endorse
    the business case. We must ask them what we need to look out for and the critical
    areas for a sign-off. It might be security, compliance, or procurement, and that
    will depend on the industry and organization. We will also need a presentation
    that summarizes our business case, and we will talk about that next.

- en: 'We need a presentation that uses the right artifacts for our stakeholders in
    the governance forum to endorse our solutions. Depending on the organization’s
    size, we might need approval in several forums. For example, one forum challenges
    all architecture and engineering aspects. Once we get an endorsement, we can present
    at a forum that challenges risk and offers organizational benefits. In that case,
    we need two presentations: a technical one and one focused on business and risk.
    The time we spend working out these presentations is as valuable as the time we
    spend on the actual business document. The presentations are the sales brochure
    of a product we believe will be a success story.'

    the key takeaways from this chapter.

    look out for. That included general indicators and specific focus areas such as
    culture, automation, strategy, operations, observability, and technology. Then,
    we moved on to defining the current and target state and exploring gaps we need
    to bridge and how important it is to keep our stakeholders engaged. We also explored
    how to add the organizational context and consider internal and external factors
    that might shape our solution. We explored how to build a roadmap, a business
    case document, and presentations that support our business case while keeping
    our stakeholders engaged. By now, we should have an endorsed business case and
    be ready to start our transformation, which we will discuss in the following and
    very last chapter.
