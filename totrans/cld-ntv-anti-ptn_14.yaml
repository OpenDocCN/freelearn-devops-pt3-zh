    to meet deadlines. We will produce average or below-average quality and build
    up tech debt. If there is no time later on to remediate the tech debt, we will
    drown in operational complexity.

    DevSecOps transformation is also a trap that can impact all areas, from strategy
    to security, compliance, data quality, operational complexity, and so on. A common
    giveaway is a lack of training budget and allocated training time. A lack of pairing
    with external consultants indicates that the knowledge is not embedded in our
    organization.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lack of standardization of building blocks and operational procedures is a
    red flag that we can easily see. Inconsistency will increase technical debt operational
    complexity, decreasing resilience and a self-service experience that helps us
    achieve fast release cycles. Giveaways for this anti-pattern include a lack of
    a service catalog or opinionated CI/CD pipelines, little changes that take a considerable
    amount of time, and an operating model that has never been agreed on, is outdated,
    or does not have clear demarcations.

    we don’t work out requirements and start with the design, we miss out on requirements
    in our solutions. Typically, those are operational, security, resilience, testing,
    data consistency, and non-functional requirements. The same is the case when we
    start with implementing without a design. This does not stop us from using Agile
    practices. We just need to consider the holistic SDLC picture.

    to meet our customer needs. On the other hand, if we do not have any governance
    in place, we will struggle with compliance, reliability, self-service experience,

    policies and compliance requirements. We will need the right balance of guardrails,

    this book and have a good understanding of possible problem areas, such as cultural
    aspects, a lack of strategy, or operational excellence. By now, we also know that
    some of the remediations will require significant undertaking. Often, there are
    dependencies, which means we need to solve other issues before we can tackle the
    problem we are trying to solve. For instance, if we want to improve our CI/CD
    pipeline to establish a better security posture and quicker time to market, we
    might first need to establish a mature DevSecOps culture. During this chapter,

    any downstream systems. If we expand to a multi-region deployment, our application
    will create more logs, such as audit logs. We will need to ingest those logs,
    and there might be a license impact, or we might need to upgrade our storage.
    The cost of logging is often underestimated, and it is worthwhile to look into
    current log volumes. A multi-region deployment will also incur cross-region data
    transfer fees, which we must consider. We will also need more TLS certificates.
    We will incur increased expenses if we acquire them from a third party. We need
    to capture those downstream impacts for the total cost because we need those numbers
    to create the business case document. If our new solution is successful, it will
    likely lead to increased traffic, and our infrastructure will need to scale out
    more. This will lead to increased data transfer fees and additional costs for
    our infrastructure resources, which we discussed in [*Chapter 4*](B22364_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112).

    automated testing? Do we have all the guardrails for our CI/CD toolchain and the
    cloud platform? Do we need to improve our *Landing Zone* because it does not consider
    security or compliance segregation enough? These gaps will hold us back, and they
    will either slow down delivery timelines or increase the overall risk. Therefore,
    we should remediate them, as we discussed in [*Chapter 4*](B22364_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112),
    and we need to re-architect on-premises applications for a cloud migration, which

    We must put the required controls in place and validate them. We must also consider
    the audit effort involved due to regulatory requirements. Compliance frameworks
    like PCI require a thorough collection of evidence for least privilege enforcement,
    data protection, encryption, firewall rules, logging of critical events, access
    logging, vulnerability scanning, and much more. The effort will take several months,
    and we must dedicate resources to these audits. We discussed regulatory requirements

    More and more service offerings get commoditized and FaaS and serverless storage

    revalidate the effort estimate. We can kick this revalidation off with a meeting
    where we provide all the context. This will be a short refresher on the initiative,
    previous estimates, and new findings since the initial effort estimate. We will
    need to spend some time on the findings because any new internal or external findings
    can impact the effort estimates. The team can then go back to the initial estimates
    and add them. Now is the time to add a column to the initial time estimate to
    capture the job function(s) that should perform a particular task. This will help

    stakeholders. If we make apparent mistakes, for example, financial calculation
    errors, we lose credibility, and we want to avoid that by all means.

    communicating timelines for the next steps, which we will discuss next.

    cycles, and budget requests must be submitted several months before a new financial
    year starts. For this request, we do not need a finalized and endorsed business
    case, but we need at least the high-level benefits. Most of the time, a cloud
    architect can provide this information by reaching out to key stakeholders or
    providers to get some cost input. If we just had an incident, such as a data breach,
    getting funding for a security uplift will be a no-brainer and can happen out
    of the financial cycle, unless the breach puts us out of business.

- en: Is there a perfect time for a business case? If we have previously requested
    a budget, we must ensure that the business case sign-off aligns with our planned
    implementation kick-off. We need to factor in unplanned delays, such as stakeholders
    not being available or emergency initiatives taking priority and we do not get
    an immediate presentation slot at the next governance meeting. Some companies
    have a quarterly or half-yearly priority assessment process. If that is the case,
    then having the business case ready will be helpful if we make good points to
    leave the organization in a better state. The short answer to the question of
    whether there is a perfect time is that it depends, but the best thing is to be
    prepared and be well-connected to stakeholders.

    case before and are not fully aware of the process, we need to engage with our
    manager or a peer contact who has done it before. They can provide some coaching
    and point us to the individuals running the governance forums who will endorse
    the business case. We must ask them what we need to look out for and the critical
    areas for a sign-off. It might be security, compliance, or procurement, and that
    will depend on the industry and organization. We will also need a presentation
    that summarizes our business case, and we will talk about that next.

    the governance forum to endorse our solutions. Depending on the organization’s
    size, we might need approval in several forums. For example, one forum challenges
    all architecture and engineering aspects. Once we get an endorsement, we can present
    at a forum that challenges risk and offers organizational benefits. In that case,
    we need two presentations: a technical one and one focused on business and risk.
    The time we spend working out these presentations is as valuable as the time we
    spend on the actual business document. The presentations are the sales brochure
    of a product we believe will be a success story.'

    look out for. That included general indicators and specific focus areas such as
    culture, automation, strategy, operations, observability, and technology. Then,
    we moved on to defining the current and target state and exploring gaps we need
    to bridge and how important it is to keep our stakeholders engaged. We also explored
    how to add the organizational context and consider internal and external factors
    that might shape our solution. We explored how to build a roadmap, a business
    case document, and presentations that support our business case while keeping
    our stakeholders engaged. By now, we should have an endorsed business case and
    be ready to start our transformation, which we will discuss in the following and
    very last chapter.
