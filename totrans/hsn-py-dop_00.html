			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Welcome to this book! Let’s talk about the content of this book and what you will learn from it. This book is about two things: DevOps and Python. It is about how these two entities, philosophies, frameworks, or whatever you would like to call them interact with <span class="No-Break">each other.</span></p>
			<p>This book will help you understand Python on a technical level, but also on a conceptual level, including what distinguishes Python from a lot of other languages and what makes it so popular among programmers and others who provide <span class="No-Break">IT solutions.</span></p>
			<p>At the same time, it will give you perspective on how important and useful DevOps is in modern IT infrastructure and how you can implement the concepts of DevOps <span class="No-Break">using Python.</span></p>
			<p>You will learn how to make the hard stuff easy and how to solve problems in a consistent and sustainable way. You will also learn how to insert bits of Python code into your workload to smoothen your <span class="No-Break">problem-solving process.</span></p>
			<p>This book will go beyond just some technical descriptions and processes and will help you make your workflow and work process even better regardless of the tools you <span class="No-Break">are using.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>If you are even remotely concerned with DevOps or developing, you will find this book useful. But there are a few specific personas who may particularly find this <span class="No-Break">book useful:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Developers looking to explore DevOps</strong>: Since this is a book that uses a lot of code for DevOps, it is perfect for developers who may want to explore DevOps</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">DevOps engineers learning Python</strong>: This book will help DevOps engineers who are learning Python and may want to try implementing some Python solutions in DevOps</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">People who like finding solutions</strong>: If you’re someone who wants to find solutions to IT problems and don’t have a specific job title, but have a job to do, this book is for you</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Often in this book, we cover tools and examples of how to use them to increase the productivity of your DevOps workload. You will need at least the version of Python mentioned here to use all the features described in the book. Most of the tasks done on one cloud platform can be done on equivalent services on <span class="No-Break">other platforms.</span></p>

			<p>A block of code is set <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="sour e- ode">def packet_handler(packet):print(packet)packet_sizes.append(len(packet))timestamps.append(packet.time)</pre>
			<p>Any command-line input or output is written <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="onsole">pip install sphinx</pre>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: “With reference to the preceding figure, when you click the <strong class="bold">Run</strong> button shown at the top, you’ll launch a Flask server (a URL that will return some sort of answer when it <span class="No-Break">is called).”</span></p>
