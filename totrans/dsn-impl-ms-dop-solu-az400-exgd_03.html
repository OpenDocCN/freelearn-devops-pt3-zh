<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Getting the Best Out of DevOps Tools </h1>
<p>DevOps can be viewed as an approach aimed to improve the overall <strong class="bold">Software Development Life Cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>) process, leading to greater collaboration between the teams <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>involved. Hence, using the right set of tools for your DevOps processes and activities is critical to driving consistency and predictability across the various engineering teams. The goal is to establish a culture of innovation by automating the various processes, thereby synchronizing the efforts of the teams (or roles) while developing, testing, and deploying software faster with the highest quality possible.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Microsoft</strong> offers great <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>products such as <strong class="bold">Azure DevOps</strong>, <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong>, <strong class="bold">Azure Monitor</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Visual Studio Code</strong> that help simplify the adoption of important <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>practices spanning <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>across the various life cycle phases of <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>your DevOps implementation. These tools are feature-rich and offer a best-in-class experience <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>to the developer <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>community. The out-of-the-box experience can be further extended using marketplace extensions offered by other <strong class="bold">Independent Software Vendors</strong> (<strong class="bold">ISVs</strong>) and even the open source community. </p>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be familiar with some of these tool offerings, as well as the context in which they can be used within your respective software development programs.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>SDLC and DevOps tools</li>
<li>Azure DevOps and GitHub</li>
<li>Azure DevTest Labs</li>
<li>Azure Monitor</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>SDLC and DevOps tools</h1>
<p>Be it a service or a product, the term SDLC refers to the set of processes and practices that are applied <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>when building a software solution to ensure quality and meet other objectives, as outlined for the engineering team.</p>
<p>These processes are typically grouped as per the various phases in the development life cycle. The maturity of these processes has evolved over the years due to the evolution of technology. As engineering systems have become relatively complex with the use of distributed computing and cloud technologies, the development teams are expected to maintain strong rigor and discipline, as well as making use of automation to sustain their digital transformation journeys.</p>
<p>Depending on which software development methodology you may follow, be it <strong class="bold">Waterfall</strong>, <strong class="bold">Agile</strong>, <strong class="bold">Scrum</strong>, <strong class="bold">Kanban</strong>, or even a tailored version of your own, it is highly likely that you will make use of the DevOps-related practices in some form or the other. However, it is worth mentioning that Waterfall is not a recommended methodology to choose anymore if you wish to realize the true potential of your DevOps investments. </p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the key activities that are executed in a DevOps life cycle.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Key activities in a DevOps life cycle</h2>
<p>At a high level, the <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>DevOps-related activities can be grouped into four different focus areas, as depicted in the following diagram:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer016">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – Focus areas and key activities in a DevOps life cycle</p>
<p>The list of activities depicted here is meant to serve as a basic foundational list. Depending on your <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>DevOps maturity level, you may implement many more practices to maximize your business outcomes. You must make use of the DevOps metrics discussed in <a href="B18655_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to DevOps</em>, that are relevant to your context, and then identify the important practices that will help you achieve it. </p>
<p>In the next few sections, we will review these focus areas in detail to help you understand each of them better.</p>
<h3>Plan and track</h3>
<p>The development team identifies and organizes the product backlog and publishes work for the team. The work <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>will be scheduled based on business priority and the available capacity. Backlog grooming and refinement is an ongoing activity throughout the life cycle of the product and shall span across multiple releases.</p>
<h3>Develop and test</h3>
<p>The development team starts producing the work outputs in the form of source code or scripts. All changes to <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>the code base are checked for quality issues using static analyzers, unit tests, and even manual inspection. Once satisfied, the artifacts are compiled and built to produce a deployable package, also known as a solution. </p>
<h3>Deploy and release</h3>
<p>The solutions are <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>initially deployed in a test environment, validated for correctness using automated tests, and then released to production environments. After this, the solution is then live and accessible to end users of the product or service.</p>
<h3>Monitor and learn</h3>
<p>Once the solution has gone live, this phase kicks in, and diagnostic and health monitoring <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>information is captured from the live usage of the product or service. The data that’s captured in the monitoring tools is periodically analyzed for faults and errors; any problems that have been identified are either mitigated using automation procedures or logged as bugs to be fixed by the team. Additionally, customer feedback can be channelized to suggest enhancements to the product or service. Now that you’re aware of what goes on in the DevOps life cycle, let’s review some of the commonly used tools for your DevOps practices. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Tools for your DevOps needs</h2>
<p>Microsoft has a wide variety of tools to support your DevOps life cycle needs. Furthermore, it supports <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>integration with other third-party tools to offer a cohesive experience to the developers of your team. So, whether you are building a new software system or maintaining one, you can easily adopt the Azure DevOps services and GitHub to innovate at scale. </p>
<p>Here we have listed <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>the tools that you can plan to make use of for the various types of SDLC activities:</p>

<p>In the next few sections, we will look at the features and capabilities of a few of these tools. Detailed usage of these tools has also been explained in the subsequent chapters while providing illustrative examples of how the respective DevOps practices are being implemented<a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Azure DevOps and GitHub</h1>
<p><strong class="bold">Azure DevOps</strong> and <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> are two powerful <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) offerings from <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>Microsoft that serve as a complete DevOps toolset. From managing <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>your backlog and team processes to a Git-based code repository to <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>having the ability to execute CI/CD processes with automated testing, you will discover that GitHub and Azure DevOps is the perfect solution for you. </p>
<p>In the following subsections, we will explore the unique features of these two tools. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Azure DevOps</h2>
<p>Originally, being part of the <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>Visual Studio suite of products, the present-day Azure DevOps is perhaps the most used product by engineering teams to manage <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>their source code and application life cycle processes. It was <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>formerly known as <strong class="bold">Visual Studio Team Services</strong> and <strong class="bold">Visual Studio Online</strong> before that. </p>
<p>Azure DevOps is an Azure <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>cloud-hosted version of the Azure DevOps server, previously known as <strong class="bold">Team Foundation Server</strong> (<strong class="bold">TFS</strong>) within the developer community. The main services that are available within this product are <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>shown in the following diagram: </p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer017">

<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer018">
<img alt="Figure 3.3 – Capabilities in Azure Boards " height="573" src="image/B18655_03_03.jpg" width="1260"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – Capabilities in Azure Boards</p>
<p>You can read <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>more about Azure Boards here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/devops/boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards?view=azure-devop">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/devops/boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards?view=azure-devop</a><strong class="source-inline">s</strong>.</p>
<p>Using Azure Boards, you <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage and organize your backlog.</li>
<li>Visualize stages and use them during daily standups and team meetings to track progress. </li>
<li>Create customized <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>dashboard reports for various stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, we will look at Azure Repos, where you will store all your work products. </p>
<h3>Azure Repos</h3>
<p><strong class="bold">Source Code Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCM</strong>) and <strong class="bold">version control</strong> are fundamental to engineering teams <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>that are managing changes to the code base. Azure Repos offers <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>a version control tool for managing a variety of software <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>development projects.</p>
<p>Azure Repos offers <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>two types of version control systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Team Foundation Version Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">TFVC</strong>): This is a centralized version control <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>system. Though not widely used in recent times, many project teams are continuing to use this approach for legacy purposes only.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Git</strong>: This is the more <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>popular distributed version control system. If you are just starting your DevOps journey, it is recommended to start with a Git-based version <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>control system only:</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer019">

</ul>
<p>Now, let’s review Azure Pipelines, which you will use for your CI/CD processes. </p>
<h3>Azure Pipelines</h3>
<p>All code-based artifacts <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>follow some sort of CI, CD, and <strong class="bold">Continuous Testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">CT</strong>) to certify <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>their quality before they can be moved to a production environment. Azure Pipelines offers automation to execute the build, test, and release workflows. The sequence of tasks to be executed is configured using <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>a YAML file. There <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>are multiple source <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>repositories (such as <strong class="bold">Azure Repos</strong>, <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong>, <strong class="bold">Bitbucket</strong>, and so on) you can choose from while building your pipelines. Also, separate pipelines are typically created for different workloads, along with gated approval checks as appropriate:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer020">
<img alt="Figure 3.5 – Capabilities in Azure Pipelines " height="796" src="image/B18655_03_05.jpg" width="1136"/>

<p>Using Azure Pipelines, you <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create CI/CD pipelines (YAML-based) to execute various tasks, such as building the solution, running automated tests, and, subsequently, deploying the solution.</li>
<li>Manage deployments to <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>different environments. You can also implement gated checks and approvals. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s review how you can organize your test cases using Azure Test Plans. </p>
<h3>Azure Test Plans</h3>
<p>Testing is a very important <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>step within an SDLC. There are different types of testing activities, such as functional testing (manual or automated), performance testing, user acceptance testing, and exploratory testing. Azure Test Plans allows you to create execution plans for any specific iteration or release, by including the applicable tests and tracking the results of the execution. Reports from executing a test plan can easily be created and inferred by the stakeholders to assess the quality of the software product <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>or service under evaluation:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer021">
