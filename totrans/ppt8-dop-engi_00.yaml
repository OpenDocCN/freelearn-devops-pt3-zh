- en: As DevOps and platform engineering have pushed demand for powerful internal
    development platforms, the need for infrastructure automation solutions has never
    been greater. Puppet is one of the most powerful infrastructure automation solutions
    used by the largest enterprises in the world and has a strong open source community.
    This book comprehensively explains both the Puppet language and the platform.
    Starting with the basic concepts and approach of how Puppet works as a stateful
    language, it builds up to explaining how to structure Puppet code to scale and
    allow flexibility and collaboration among teams. It then looks at how the Puppet
    platform allows management and reporting of infrastructure configuration, showing
    how the platform can be integrated with other tools such as ServiceNow and Splunk.
    Finally, approaches will be discussed to understand how to implement Puppet to
    fit into heavily regulated and audited environments as well as modern hybrid cloud
    environments.

    of both the Puppet language and platform and be able to structure and scale Puppet
    to create a platform to provide enterprise-grade infrastructure automation.

- en: This book is ideal for DevOps engineers looking to automate infrastructure configuration
    with Puppet. It specifically focuses on Puppet’s configuration management capabilities
    but goes on to touch on other infrastructure management practices in general.
    It will allow both beginners and current Puppet users to learn about the full
    power of the Puppet language and platform.

    Puppet 5\. It will also highlight items that have dropped out of Puppet. It will
    cover useful tools to assist development, such as VS Code and the **Puppet Development
    Kit** (**PDK**), showing how the lab and development environment will work for

    how to use them so you can understand the initial stages of writing Puppet code,
    showing how resource types and providers work together to create stateful code
    independent of the underlying OS implementation and how classes allow us to group
    these resources.'

    with Puppet, how it fits into a DevOps approach, and how we will approach it in
    this book. We will then take a high-level overview of the core components of Puppet.
    The development lab environment used throughout the book will be reviewed, along
    with useful references and further learning resources. Then, we will begin with
    the basics of the language by looking at classes, resources, variables, and functions.
