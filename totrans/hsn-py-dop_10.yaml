    this problem by looking at the time taken every inning and what were the longest
    aspects of those innings. They realized that pickoffs and the time taken by pitchers
    to wind up their pitch were slowing down the game. This led to the creation of
    the pitch clock, a timer for how long a pitcher can wait between pitches thrown.
    They had determined that this time between pitches was the main reason that the
    game had slowed down and they believed that the clock would rectify the situation.
