    emerged from the collaborative efforts of lead author Cecil ‘Gary’ Rupp and esteemed
    colleagues Richard Knaster, Steve Pereira, and Al Shalloway. Together, they aimed
    to provide a comprehensive guide on modern Lean-Agile and value stream management
    practices tailored for IT specialists, business professionals, and domain experts

    on modern Lean-Agile practices. Gary was drawn to this topic because of his long-term
    interest in it, which was fueled by his past practitioner and consulting experiences.
    Additionally, recent training engagements, including the delivery of an extensive
    online course to 600 IT specialists for a multinational client, reinforced his
    enthusiasm for exploring this area. Gary then approached his three colleagues
    to join him.

    throughout this book, enriching the discourse and broadening its scope and relevance.

- en: The primary objective of this book is to introduce the integration of Lean and
    Agile principles and practices, recognizing the evolution of Lean from manufacturing
    industries and Agile from the software industry. Lean principles focus on eliminating
    waste and streamlining processes to deliver value more efficiently with higher
    quality. At the same time, Agile methodologies prioritize iterative development
    and constant feedback to enhance responsiveness to customer needs.

- en: The integration of Lean and Agile concepts, often referred to as ‘*Lean-Agile*,’
    leverages the strengths of both approaches. It ensures high-quality, efficient
    deliveries and the ability to adapt to evolving market dynamics, thereby driving
    sustained competitive advantage.

- en: At its core lies the fundamental premise that organizations must embrace Lean-Agile
    principles and practices holistically across the enterprise. This involves optimizing
    productivity, throughput, and efficiency while remaining sufficiently flexible
    to adapt to changing business requirements, market dynamics, and customer needs.

- en: Central to this approach is the concept of value stream management (VSM), advocated
    by the authors for driving continuous improvements across organizational value
    streams. Value streams organize the end-to-end business processes within organizations,
    serving as a more effective framework for delivering value to customers. The VSM
    concept helps organizations break down the cross-functional and departmental barriers
    that often impede efficient deliveries. By focusing on product-oriented activities
    and processes, value streams emphasize the importance of delivering value through
    the development and delivery of customer-centric products and services.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aligned with their belief that methods must precede tools, the authors present
    a nine-step VSM methodology designed to assist organizations in identifying and
    prioritizing value stream improvements efficiently. At the core of this methodology
    lies value stream mapping, a critical technique for visualizing and analyzing
    business processes to pinpoint opportunities for enhancing efficiency and reducing
    waste.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, the authors introduce advanced concepts focused on evaluating
    value stream improvements across a spectrum, ranging from early-stage development
    to maturity, characterized by standardized activities, high throughput, quality,
    and efficient flows. Additionally, they present the Basic Lean-Agile Solutions
    Teams (BLAST) framework, designed to integrate the work of multiple teams collaboratively
    using both Lean flow and Agile iterative and incremental development practices.
    This book also introduces the Business Agility System for the Enterprise (BASE)
    concepts, which integrates work across an enterprise to produce customer-centric
    increments of new product-oriented value continuously and on cadence.

    organizational competitiveness. The authors introduce the Business-Role-Information-Action
    (BRIA) process as a means to find the information needed to make informed and
    timely decisions. Beyond theory, BRIA offers practical strategies for harnessing
    digital advancements to improve business processes, systems, products, and services.

    concepts to advanced strategies for organizational transformation. Each section
    offers actionable insights and guidance to facilitate seamless adoption and sustained
    practice. However, those who are time-limited and need to cut to the chase should
    read *Part 4* (*Chapters 10, 11, and 12*) first, as these summary-level chapters
    discuss data and information management, Lean-Agile and VSM implementation, and
    cross-cutting themes.
