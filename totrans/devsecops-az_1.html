			<p><st c="1740">If you ask 10 people </st><a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><st c="1762">what DevOps is, you will probably get 10 different answers, depending on these people’s backgrounds and probably the books they have read. </st><st c="1901">Therefore, it is important for us to establish a working definition that we will use for DevOps for the rest of this book. </st><st c="2024">Microsoft’s official definition of DevOps was coined by Donavan Brown at a conference in 2018. </st><st c="2119">You can still find the video on YouTube: </st><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbFzojQOjyA"><st c="2160">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbFzojQOjyA</st></a><st c="2203">. Here is </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2213">the definition:</st></span></p>
			<p class="author-quote"><st c="2228">DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.</st></p>
			<p><st c="2338">From this definition, we want to highlight a few essential points. </st><st c="2406">To start with, it is essential to understand that DevOps is </st><em class="italic"><st c="2466">not</st></em><st c="2469"> a tool, a product, or a job title. </st><st c="2505">Instead, it is a collaborative approach to software development. </st><st c="2570">It is a way of working/thinking, and most of all, it is a change of culture (more on this later). </st><st c="2668">Another key point to note is that the primary goal of DevOps is to ensure the speedy and frequent delivery of functional software to end users. </st><st c="2812">If what has been implemented does not have this impact, it is likely not DevOps, or it has not been appropriately implemented (we will discuss this in more detail in the </st><em class="italic"><st c="2982">Staying clear of DevOps anti-types</st></em><st c="3016"> section in this chapter). </st><st c="3043">The last point that we would like to stress is that there are three aspects to DevOps. </st><st c="3130">There is a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="3141">people</st></strong><st c="3147"> aspect, a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="3158">process</st></strong><st c="3165"> aspect, and a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="3180">product</st></strong><st c="3187"> aspect. </st><st c="3196">In the next section, we will begin by examining the process aspect, but before we do that, let’s discuss why organizations are rapidly moving towards a DevOps approach for software development </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3389">and delivery.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><st c="3402">The why of DevOps – Innovation, velocity, and speed</st></h2>
			<p><st c="3454">While we have </st><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><st c="3469">dedicated</st><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><st c="3478"> significant time to discussing the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><st c="3513"> process, people, and product aspects of DevOps, it is equally important to understand the driving factors that lead companies to embrace DevOps and the reasons for its growing significance in recent years. </st><st c="3720">DevOps provides unique advantages to companies that other software delivery approaches cannot match. </st><st c="3821">The following points are some of the benefits associated with </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3883">DevOps adoption:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3899">Accelerating time to market</st></strong><st c="3927">: This refers </st><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><st c="3942">to the ability to bring new products to market faster. </st><st c="3997">According to research conducted by Puppet, companies that embrace the culture and practices of DevOps deploy code 46 times more frequently compared to those that </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4159">do not.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4166">Adapting to the market and competition</st></strong><st c="4205">: This means being able to adapt to changes in the market and competition. </st><st c="4281">For example, Etsy, an online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, uses DevOps practices to deploy code changes 50 times per day. </st><st c="4417">This allows the company to quickly test and launch new features, respond to user feedback, and stay ahead </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4523">of competitors.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4538">Maintaining system stability and reliability</st></strong><st c="4583">: DevOps practices can help organizations maintain system stability and reliability by improving communication and collaboration between development and operations teams. </st><st c="4755">For example, Netflix uses a DevOps approach to ensure that its streaming service remains available and responsive at all times. </st><st c="4883">The company achieves this by automating its infrastructure deployment and using a “chaos monkey” tool to intentionally introduce failures in its systems, which helps identify and address weaknesses before they </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5093">cause problems.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5108">Improving mean time to recovery</st></strong><st c="5140">: By adopting DevOps practices, organizations can improve their ability to recover from incidents and outages more efficiently. </st><st c="5269">For instance, Target, a leading retail company in the US, reduced its</st><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><st c="5338"> overall </st><strong class="bold"><st c="5347">mean time to recovery (MTTR)</st></strong><st c="5375"> by 90% after implementing DevOps practices. </st><st c="5420">This allowed the company to minimize the impact of outages and maintain high levels of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5507">customer satisfaction.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="5529">With the basics</st><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><st c="5545"> covered, let’s delve into the process used in DevOps to</st><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> <span class="No-Break"><st c="5601">create</st></span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="5608"> workflows.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><st c="5619">Understanding the process aspect of DevOps</st></h1>
			<p><st c="5662">Whenever DevOps is </st><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><st c="5682">discussed, it is tempting to make technology or tooling the main focus. </st><st c="5754">However, without well-defined processes in place, any benefits or results achieved from adopting DevOps will be limited at best, and it may even create additional challenges </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5928">and complexities!</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="5945">In the DevOps methodology, the process aspect refers to the creation of an efficient and streamlined workflow for software development, testing, and deployment. </st><st c="6107">The goal is to optimize the development process to ensure that software is delivered quickly and reliably to end users while maintaining a high level </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6257">of quality.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6268">This involves the use of agile development methodologies and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6330">continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)</st></strong><st c="6384"> practices. </st><st c="6396">These practices involve automating </st><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><st c="6431">various aspects of the software development lifecycle, such as code testing, building, and deployment. </st><st c="6534">Generally, when an organization adopts a DevOps approach, it must implement five essential practices: </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6636">Agile Planning</st></strong><st c="6650">, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6652">Version Control</st></strong><st c="6667">, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6669">Continuous Integration</st></strong><st c="6691"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="6693">CI</st></strong><st c="6695">), </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6699">Continuous Delivery</st></strong><st c="6718"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="6720">CD</st></strong><st c="6722">), and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="6730">Continuous Monitoring</st></strong><st c="6751"> (see </st><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="6757">Figure 1</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="6765">.1</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="6767">):</st></span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/><st c="7458">Understanding the five core practices of DevOps</st></h2>
			<p><st c="7506">In this section, we will examine the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><st c="7543"> five fundamental practices of DevOps, beginning with </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7597">agile planning.</st></span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold"><st c="7612">Agile planning</st></strong><st c="7627"> is a broad </st><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><st c="7639">reference to techniques used to plan and track our software projects in DevOps. </st><st c="7719">It is a project management approach that involves breaking down a project into small, manageable pieces and working on them iteratively. </st><st c="7856">The agile methodology was formally launched in 2001 through the Agile Manifesto, covering the main principles of Agile project management. </st><st c="7995">To get more information on the Agile Manifesto, you can go </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8054">to </st></span><a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"><span class="No-Break"><st c="8057">https://agilemanifesto.org/</st></span></a><span class="No-Break"><st c="8084">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8085">The goal is to deliver a functional product incrementally and continuously while taking feedback from </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8188">the stakeholders.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8205">A simple example of agile planning can be seen in the development of a mobile app. </st><st c="8289">Let’s say a company wants to develop a mobile application that can be used to order food from local restaurants. </st><st c="8402">The development team would first identify the key features that the app should have, such as a menu, ordering system, payment system, and user profiles. </st><st c="8555">With these requirements in hand, they would then design the architecture of the app. </st><st c="8640">Following this, the team would break down these features into smaller, more manageable tasks, such as designing the user interface, creating a database to store orders, and integrating the payment system. </st><st c="8845">The team would then prioritize these tasks based on the business value they add and the level of effort required to complete them. </st><st c="8976">Once the tasks are prioritized, the team would estimate the time required to complete each task and create a sprint plan. </st><st c="9098">A sprint is a short, time-boxed period (usually 1–2 weeks) during which the team works on a set </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9194">of tasks.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9203">During each sprint, the team would work on the tasks in priority order, complete them, and get feedback from stakeholders. </st><st c="9327">The feedback would then be used to make adjustments to the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><st c="9385"> product and the plan for the next sprint. </st><st c="9428">This process of breaking down tasks, prioritizing them, estimating time, and working iteratively with feedback is the core of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9554">agile planning.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="9569">Important note</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="9584">To understand the guiding values of agile development, we recommend reviewing the twelve principles of agile development that are highlighted </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9727">here: </st></span><a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/"><span class="No-Break"><st c="9733">https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/</st></span></a><span class="No-Break"><st c="9813">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9814">The second practice, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="9836">version control</st></strong><st c="9851">, allows developers to manage changes to code efficiently, collaborate effectively, and keep track of all changes made to the code. </st><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="9983">Figure 1</st></em></span><em class="italic"><st c="9991">.2</st></em><st c="9993"> shows a simple example of how version control works in DevOps. </st><st c="10057">Suppose a team of developers is working on a software application. </st><st c="10124">They create a repository (a central location to store code) using</st><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/><st c="10189"> a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="10192">version control system</st></strong><st c="10214"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="10216">VCS</st></strong><st c="10219">) such as Git. </st><st c="10235">Each developer can clone the repository to their local computer, or they might work directly in a controlled development environment, eliminating the need to copy code to a local PC. </st><st c="10418">It is worth noting that some companies have strict policies regarding this workflow and do not allow code to be </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10530">cloned locally.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="10698">Let’s say Developer A is assigned to work on feature A; they create a new branch in the repository called </st><strong class="bold"><st c="10805">feature A</st></strong><st c="10814"> and start making changes to the code. </st><st c="10853">Meanwhile, Developer B is working on a different feature in the application. </st><st c="10930">They create a new branch called </st><strong class="bold"><st c="10962">feature B</st></strong><st c="10971"> and start making changes to the code. </st><st c="11010">Both developers can work on their features independently without affecting each other’s work. </st><st c="11104">Once they have completed their changes, they can merge their branches back into the main branch (also called the </st><strong class="bold"><st c="11217">trunk</st></strong><st c="11222"> branch) in</st><a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> <span class="No-Break"><st c="11233">the repository.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="11249">If there are any conflicts </st><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/><st c="11277">between the changes made by the two developers, the VCS will highlight them, and the developers can resolve them before merging the branches. </st><st c="11419">The VCS also keeps a record of all changes made to the code, including who made them, when they were made, and why they were made. </st><st c="11550">If there is a problem with the new code, the team can use the VCS to roll back to a previous version of the code quickly. </st><st c="11672">This rollback feature is useful if a bug is introduced into the code or if the new changes cause </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11769">unexpected problems.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="12860">The fourth practice, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="12882">continuous delivery</st></strong><st c="12901"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="12903">CD</st></strong><st c="12905">), refers to the ongoing testing and deployment of </st><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><st c="12957">validated software using an automated process. </st><st c="13004">It allows teams to release new features and bug fixes quickly using a continuous process. </st><st c="13094">The goal of CD is to enable development teams to deliver software changes to production quickly and with confidence while maintaining a high level of quality </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13252">and reliability.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="13268">Suppose a team of developers is working on a web application; when the team writes code for a new feature, it is committed to a version control system and is automatically tested by a series of automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests. </st><st c="13543">Once the code passes all the tests, it’s automatically deployed to a staging environment where it undergoes additional testing and review by the product owner. </st><st c="13703">If everything looks good, the code is then automatically deployed to production, where it’s made available to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13813">all users.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="13823">The fifth practice </st><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><st c="13843">of </st><strong class="bold"><st c="13846">continuous monitoring</st></strong><st c="13867"> involves gathering</st><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><st c="13886"> feedback from users and collecting telemetry data from running applications in real time. </st><st c="13977">The goal is to ensure that software systems are meeting the needs of users and delivering value to the organization. </st><st c="14094">It requires gathering continuous insights into the performance and behavior of software systems and using that information to make data-driven decisions that improve the overall quality and user experience. </st><st c="14301">To understand this practice better, let’s break it down into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14362">two components:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="14377">Gathering feedback from users</st></strong><st c="14407">: User feedback is an essential component of continuous monitoring because it helps to identify issues and areas for improvement in the software system from the user’s perspective. </st><st c="14589">Feedback can be collected through various channels, such as surveys, user reviews, and support tickets. </st><st c="14693">By analyzing this feedback, development teams can identify patterns and trends that highlight areas for improvement and prioritize these improvements based on their impact on the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14872">user experience.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="14888">Collecting telemetry data from running applications</st></strong><st c="14940">: Telemetry data refers to a broad range of information collected from various sources as the software system operates in real time. </st><st c="15074">These sources can include application logs, server metrics, network traffic, user interactions, error reports, and more. </st><st c="15195">Metrics such as response times, error rates, and server load, as well as insights into user behavior, can be derived from these data. </st><st c="15329">By collecting and analyzing telemetry data, development teams can gain a comprehensive understanding of the software’s performance and user interactions. </st><st c="15483">This data is invaluable for detecting anomalies and potential issues before they escalate into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="15578">critical problems.</st></span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><st c="17151">The second stage is </st><strong class="bold"><st c="17172">Code</st></strong><st c="17176">, which involves the actual coding and development of software using the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><st c="17248"> selected programming languages, frameworks, and tools. </st><st c="17304">It is at this stage that version control practices are implemented. </st><st c="17372">The team collaborates to develop the code and commit changes to a version </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="17446">control system.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="17461">The third stage is </st><strong class="bold"><st c="17481">Build</st></strong><st c="17486"> and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="17491">Test</st></strong><st c="17495">, where continuous integration practices are implemented. </st><st c="17553">In this stage, the code is converted into executable software and tested to guarantee that it works as intended and fulfills project requirements. </st><st c="17700">A combination of automated and manual tests is employed to detect and resolve any errors, bugs, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="17796">or defects.</st></span></p>
