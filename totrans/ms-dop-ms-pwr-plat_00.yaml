    platform – a modern application runtime on which an infinite number of business
    solutions can be realized.</st> <st c="182">The more complex and business-critical
    these scenarios become, the more need there is for professional DevOps processes.</st>
    <st c="303">This book focuses on the well-known practices of custom software development
    projects and the mapping of these common activities to the Microsoft Power Platform
    toolset.</st> <st c="473">We explore every phase of the software development life
    cycle and the tools and capabilities that are provided by this Software-as-a-Service
    (SaaS) product to delve into the usual DevOps activities, such as packaging, building,
    deploying, testing, and releasing solutions, in detail.</st> <st c="757">In addition,
    we take a deep dive into DevSecOps processes and introduce the security-infused
    development practices in Microsoft Power Platform.</st> <st c="901">You’ll learn
    about modern DevOps tools such as Azure DevOps Services and GitHub and the different
    ways to implement DevOps processes for Microsoft Power Platform.</st> <st c="1064">With
    the right DevOps implementation in place, our solutions can run in highly regulated
    industries in a controlled and</st> <st c="1184">governed manner.</st>

    <st c="1422">The platform was created for professional developers and engineering

    work will change significantly and the focus will shift to prompt engineering
    and larger building blocks.</st> <st c="2210">Since AI agents can act in different
    roles (as developers, testers, or project managers) and can synthesize applications
    on their own with only provided prompts, instead of writing code lines, we craft
    components.</st> <st c="2424">These components can correspond to the building
    blocks offered by Power Platform.</st> <st c="2506">Considering the Copilots for
    Power Platform, a kind of new application crafting era has just begun, which can
    only be successful if DevOps processes are implemented in the same way as in the
    case of custom</st> <st c="2712">development projects.</st>
