- en: Organizations in recent years have recognized the benefits of more collaborative
    and iterative approaches to software development. The traditional model, where
    development and operations teams worked in silos, made it difficult for companies
    to quickly and reliably deliver new features. The adoption of DevOps has addressed
    these challenges by promoting integration and communication between development
    and operations. The additional proliferation of tooling and automated workflows
    have helped improve software quality and stability.

- en: A key element of DevOps is continuous integration and continuous delivery (or
    deployment) (**CI/CD**). CI/CD is the practice of regularly integrating developer
    contributions into a shared repository, and then automatically building, testing,
    and releasing the application. The goal is to minimize the cycle time required
    to deploy software updates, as well as reduce human error during the process.

    the stages of the software development life cycle. The content will focus primarily
    on concepts and examples, without locking you into feature capabilities and UI
    workflows that will likely change over time. After completing this book, you will
    be equipped to use GitLab to manage almost any software project, while also learning
    about the best practices that can be applied across other DevOps workflows and
    CI/CD tools.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for anyone involved in the software development life cycle
    with software projects of any size. If that sounds broad, that’s because it is!
    GitLab has something to offer people in a huge variety of roles. Traditional GitLab
    users include developers, QA, security testers, performance testers, product owners,
    project managers, UX designers, technical writers, release engineers, and the
    broad range of roles that fall under the amorphous terms of “DevOps” and “DevSecOps.”
    So if you find yourself involved with planning, writing, testing, securing, building,
    packaging, or deploying software, or managing any of those tasks, and you’re wondering
    how to automate any of the slow, error-prone tasks that you currently perform
    manually, this book will almost certainly give you ideas about how to improve
    your life using GitLab and its automated CI/CD pipelines.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes no prior knowledge other than some familiarity with one or
    more of the major stages of the software development life cycle. We expect every
    reader will be involved with different parts of the life cycle, so will focus
    on the parts of the book that are most relevant to them. That’s a perfectly good
    way to approach this book, although we recommend everyone read the four chapters
    that make up the first section since they explain background concepts and terminology
    that are required knowledge for all GitLab users.

    version 15.x. Future versions are likely to introduce some drift in the GUI, but
    the fundamental concepts and operations should remain the same.

    was slow and error-prone before GitLab came along, which will help you understand
    the problems GitLab solves. You will also learn about the basics of the Git version
    control system and be introduced to the fundamental concepts and components of
    GitLab. Finally, you will get your first look at GitLab CI/CD pipelines, which
    will form the focus of most of the rest of the book.
