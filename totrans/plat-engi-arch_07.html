			<p><st c="2958">In the preceding</st><a id="_idIndexMarker719"/><st c="2975"> diagram, you can already see some common security best practices implemented at the point where users are trying to interact with the application and its supporting infrastructure. </st><st c="3157">However, security at the dev team and open source dependencies’ levels, within source control, with CI/CD, and on the application, itself is not addressed. </st><st c="3313">Even storage for keys and secrets, while representing a best practice, also needs security applied to the accessing of those passwords. </st><st c="3449">Security to the left helps you develop your security story from the beginning of the product life cycle through to the delivery of the completed application to the end users. </st><st c="3624">In platform engineering, this can create a feeling of dissonance between the most secure platform and the platform that achieves perfect self-service. </st><st c="3775">Since the platform needs to support developer self-service, then the platform owning the full security story starts to run counter to the flexibility that accompanies self-service. </st><st c="3956">It can, therefore, impose enough restrictions for it to feel like a high barrier to entry and thus jeopardize the adoption of the platform and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4099">developer happiness.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="4119">In days past, </st><em class="italic"><st c="4134">Trust but Verify</st></em><st c="4150"> would have been the security model to solve this. </st><st c="4201">The meaning is self-explanatory. </st><st c="4234">You trust the developers have done everything necessary to maintain the desired security posture for the application, but at the platform team, you don’t own the security posture end to end. </st><st c="4425">That platform would verify to the best of its ability that all the right things have been done without intruding </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4538">on self-service.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="4554">These days, security best practices have shifted, and </st><em class="italic"><st c="4609">Zero Trust</st></em><st c="4619"> is the name of the game. </st><st c="4645">Zero Trust </st><a id="_idIndexMarker720"/><st c="4656">essentially assumes everyone is a bad actor (whether or not that’s intentional is irrelevant). </st><st c="4751">To maintain this security posture, the platform needs to conform to best practices, but it cannot take on the responsibility of the application. </st><st c="4896">In other words, the platform needs to provide all the scaffolding to the dev team and the stakeholders to support a secure and compliant product. </st><st c="5042">For example, if the Python language is needed, then a secured Python binary, either internally secured or from a trusted vendor, could be supplied within an image registry accessible to all users and applications of the platform. </st><st c="5272">Using Python-Slim from the Docker registry is also a more secure choice and more readily available. </st><st c="5372">The Slim image is probably fine for most use cases. </st><st c="5424">From there, a reasonable and self-service attentive restriction would be to deny workloads that don’t use images from a known safe source. </st><st c="5563">A check in the CI pipeline can handle this. </st><st c="5607">Pushing the check as far left as possible saves everyone time and also avoids spending compute processing a change that isn’t conformant to the security posture. </st><st c="5769">However, adding a check in that part can be a little painful as it involves writing a job to scan, analyze, and then reach a decision based on the contents of all Dockerfiles in the repository. </st><st c="5963">Those could be nested within sub-directories, and while it’s not the most impossible challenge, it can be painful. </st><st c="6078">Additionally, writing this type of functionality into CI pipelines should be considered out of the scope of the average </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6198">platform team.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6212">From the platform perspective, an alternative approach would be to use policy engines and admission webhooks to reject any Pod definition that doesn’t leverage a trusted image source. </st><st c="6397">This isn’t as far left as the ideal, and hopefully, the development team and the processes they follow prevent cases where this would be necessary, but in Zero Trust environments, this policy would act as a last fail-safe to ensure only the correct software is being promoted to production environments. </st><st c="6701">It could be deemed reasonable that images from more public sources are acceptable for prototyping within the IDP, and therefore, the fail-safe is only necessary for production environments. </st><st c="6891">This allows the platform to continue to act in service to the team and not unnecessarily </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6980">impede them.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6992">Another example would be to only accept commits into a GitHub repository if the commit is signed. </st><st c="7091">The signature identifies that the author and the code hasn’t been tampered with since the signature was applied. </st><st c="7204">This can be enforced via webhooks on a GitHub repository, although how much influence the platform team has over GitHub organizations for any company may be limited; the security team (if present) will likely require this. </st><st c="7427">And while it’s a good example of </st><a id="_idIndexMarker721"/><st c="7460">Zero Trust and security to the left working together, it’s again most likely out of the scope of the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7561">platform team.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7575">However much these phrases may sound like empty aphorisms, teams fail if they ignore the fundamental principles they represent. </st><st c="7704">Security done right is one of the best investments a company can make. </st><st c="7775">Shifting security left means testing it early and testing </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7833">it often.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7842">Every major security breach and vulnerability could have been caught with testing. </st><st c="7926">There are various types of testing, including some specifically executed by security professionals, but regardless of whether it’s penetration testing or just basic negative testing in your quality engineering process, security and compliance should be tested regularly to guarantee there are no unexpected surface areas. </st><st c="8248">This could look like using software in unexpected ways, or simply validating that the permissions settings for roles within the organization </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8389">are correct.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8401">Now that we’ve introduced the concepts of security to the left and Trust but Verify, let’s look at how to build a system that is both secure </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8543">and flexib</st><a id="_idTextAnchor386"/><st c="8553">le.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor387"/><st c="8557">Understanding platform security – how to build a secure yet flexible and open system</st></h1>
			<p><st c="8642">The platform isn’t the</st><a id="_idIndexMarker722"/><st c="8665"> totality of an organization’s security posture; rather, it’s part of an equation. </st><st c="8748">When assessing how to integrate cybersecurity or DevSecOps into the platform, a balance must be stuck. </st><st c="8851">Pushing security to the left helps to reduce the efforts the platform team needs to exert, but a clear and defined scope helps everyone to understand their part of the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9019">security st</st><a id="_idTextAnchor388"/><st c="9030">ory.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor389"/><st c="9035">Breaking down the problem into consumable chunks</st></h2>
			<p><st c="9084">Security and flexibility can also feel like two words that stand diametrically opposed. </st><st c="9173">Good security is inherently inflexible; however, it’s possible and necessary for an IDP’s success to balance both. </st><st c="9288">How do we achieve this? </st><st c="9312">Step one </st><a id="_idIndexMarker723"/><st c="9321">is </st><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><st c="9324">scope security</st></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="9338">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9339">The first part of scoping is to understand what the minimum level of security is that’s required. </st><st c="9438">Obviously, we should always do more than the bare minimum, so if you want to understand what a maximum level would look like, it’s not the worst idea, but it may artificially increase the scope and cause you to be unable to see the forest for the trees. </st><st c="9692">Therefore, it’s our recommendation to start with a narrow focus. </st><st c="9757">Once you know what the minimum level of security is that the platform must enforce, then you start looking at what the minimum level of security is that the platform </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9923">must support.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9936">When you go down the path of security, it’s very easy to quickly realize how dangerous the world of the internet is and overcorrect. </st><st c="10070">These overcorrections can increase cognitive load and create a barrier to entry for using a platform. </st><st c="10172">If a good developer is lazy, then the platform will need to help them to be lazy, not introduce additional layers of complexity. </st><st c="10301">It’s for this reason that while the platform cannot own the entire cybersecurity posture of an organization, it plays a pivotal role in said posture. </st><st c="10451">Security is good; security theater </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10486">is not.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="10493">Knowing how much is too much and how much is just right is a skill that gets honed over time, and there’s nothing to cleanly say when a security measure is too much or just right. </st><st c="10674">The answer will always be: </st><em class="italic"><st c="10701">It depends</st></em><st c="10711">. For example, securing an environment so that it is not accessible to the public internet may impede the ability of people working on a project to work from home, but if that project involves space shuttles or nuclear reactors, then the air-gapped environment is correct, and not </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10992">an overcorrection.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="11010">Many security experts have spent years researching security and defining solid definitions of what it means to be secure and compliant. </st><st c="11147">The </st><strong class="bold"><st c="11151">National Institute of Standards and Technology</st></strong><st c="11197"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="11199">NIST</st></strong><st c="11203">) division</st><a id="_idIndexMarker724"/><st c="11214"> of the US Department of Commerce is built up of such experts who regularly publish new standards and update pre-existing standards as the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11353">industry evolves.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="11370">It’s worth understanding the work of these organizations to help guide you in developing your </st><a id="_idIndexMarker725"/><st c="11465">understanding of how security and a flexible </st><strong class="bold"><st c="11510">Internal Developer</st></strong> <strong class="bold"><st c="11528">Platform</st></strong><st c="11537"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="11539">IDP</st></strong><st c="11542">) intersect. </st><st c="11556">Since these agencies typically publish standards for companies that work with the government, it’s worth noting that their publications are intended for a specific type of audience and do not replace talking to a cybersecurity expert with experience in your </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11814">specific indu</st><a id="_idTextAnchor390"/><st c="11827">stry.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="27500">Each white box, even</st><a id="_idIndexMarker773"/><st c="27521"> the security-related boxes, must have its own security gates. </st><st c="27584">The ability to manage RBAC for the organization cannot be open for just anyone to change, as an example. </st><st c="27689">It’s easy to see how this can quickly spiral into a problem that has spawned an entire field of experts. </st><st c="27794">We won’t seek to replace their knowledge and expertise in this book; however, we will share some of the most important aspects of security for an IDP as we see them to get you started on the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="27985">right path.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="27996">An easy win for any organization is to have the staging, development, and production environments all completely isolated from one another. </st><st c="28137">This includes having separate databases with different access rules entirely versus one database with different tables and different </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="28270">access rules.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="28283">It is possible to use a single cluster and have network policy-based separations, RBAC that applies to very specific namespaces, and create a similar experience for isolation as you would experience with having multiple clusters, but the cluster’s API server, audit logs, </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="28556">etcd</st></strong><st c="28560">, networking, and other cluster-scoped resources will still represent a single point of potential failure of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="28669">that isolation.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="28684">Therefore, for </st><a id="_idIndexMarker774"/><st c="28700">security and compliance, it’s best to separate environments completely. </st><st c="28772">By having two distinct clusters, the isolation of the production data is guaranteed and leaves less room for human error to impact that security. </st><st c="28918">From there, you may also have different networking configurations, such as firewall rules that have different allowances, or even environments that are completely disconnected </st><a id="_idTextAnchor401"/><st c="29094">from the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="29103">public internet.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="29147">In Kubernetes, a Secret</st><a id="_idIndexMarker775"/><st c="29171"> is a password, authentication token, environment variable, API key, or similar piece of sensitive data that an application may need to access in order to function correctly or accomplish a task. </st><st c="29367">Secret management</st><a id="_idIndexMarker776"/><st c="29384"> becomes one of the most critical challenges to solve when working on a system that relies so heavily on automation as an IDP does. </st><st c="29516">Fortunately, there are patterns and technologies designed to help </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="29582">handle this.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="29594">As a Kubernetes-based platform, the built-in Kubernetes functions for secret security are the key starting point. </st><st c="29709">It’s important to know that default behaviors are not secure. </st><st c="29771">Secrets are stored similarly to ConfigMaps and are not encrypted. </st><st c="29837">They are encoded, but the encoding is only </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="29880">base64</st></strong><st c="29886">. This is fine for development environments but not so good for production environments. </st><st c="29975">You can, however, encrypt secret data at rest without installing any </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="30044">third-party applications.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="30069">For further reading on encryption at rest, and some examples that could be used against a test cluster, please see the </st><em class="italic"><st c="30189">Data encryption</st></em><st c="30204"> section of the Kubernetes </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="30231">documentation: </st></span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/"><span class="No-Break"><st c="30246">https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/</st></span></a><span class="No-Break"><st c="30311">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="30312">Secret management is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker777"/><st c="30333"> often fairly large in scope, and once you have more than one cluster or more than one environment, it becomes difficult to manage all the secrets required for the IDP to support applications. </st><st c="30526">As such, the use of secret storage software such as HashiCorp’s Vault or password managers such as Bitwarden or 1Password has become the industry standard. </st><st c="30682">A standard best practice for landing secrets in a cluster automatically is to store in a code a reference to the secret and then have a logic of some kind that knows how to look up the secret by its reference and fetch it for the application. </st><st c="30925">As such, a common pattern for applications to pull in secret information via references is to leverage a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="31030">sidecar model.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="32592">Of course, the authentication secret to the storage must be supplied initially for the operator to work. </st><st c="32698">This can pose a little bit of a Catch-22 as whoever sets up this operator will need the ability to provide it with credentials to access the off-cluster </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="32851">secret storage.</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="33483">Sanitizing logs</st></h3>
			<p><st c="33499">Any logs the platform generates should </st><a id="_idIndexMarker785"/><st c="33539">be sanitized. </st><st c="33553">This is true for applications as well; however, that exceeds the boundaries of the platform. </st><st c="33646">Logs are part of the data and, therefore, assets that the security of the platform needs to protect. </st><st c="33747">In addition to the storage and transmission topic we covered previously, data sanitization is a key part of ensuring that even if a bad actor gains access to logging data, they cannot use it to further compromise the system. </st><st c="33972">Code quality checking tools such as </st><a id="_idIndexMarker786"/><st c="34008">SonarQube (</st><a href="https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/"><st c="34019">https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/</st></a><st c="34066">) are excellent for detecting any sensitive data going to the wrong location, allowing for remediation of the issue before a security incident </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="34210">can occur.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="34220">Logs that are sanitized are cleared of passwords or tokens in their body. </st><st c="34295">For example, when logging requests to an API, how the request was authenticated (for example, bearer token) could be logged, but the actual token itself needs to be scrubbed. </st><st c="34470">Where sensitive data is captured or stored, it should be salted </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="34534">and hashed.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="34545">These platform logs </st><a id="_idIndexMarker787"/><st c="34566">should also be kept as clear as possible of </st><strong class="bold"><st c="34610">Personally Identifiable Information</st></strong><st c="34645"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="34647">PII</st></strong><st c="34650">). </st><st c="34654">This type of data is typically not required, so storing it creates an unnecessary risk </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="34741">surface area.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="50200">GitOps was covered in</st><a id="_idIndexMarker814"/><st c="50222"> depth in </st><a href="B31164_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor255"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="50232">Chapter 5</st></em></span></a><st c="50241">, so we’ll simply review it very briefly due to its importance for platform security. </st><st c="50327">GitOps is loosely defined as an automated process that validates the SOT (Git or other version control), which defines the desired state and the actual state match. </st><st c="50492">It does this through one-time deployments or changes but also through an automated reconcile loop that actively checks for changes in the desired state and acts upon the actual state to make it match, or detects a change in the actual state and makes changes on the system to put it back to the desired state. </st><st c="50802">The current largest open source GitOps project is Argo CD, a CD tool that is a property of CNCF. </st><st c="50899">Within Argo CD and other GitOps paradigms, there are a few best practices to note for guaranteeing a more </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="51005">secure environment.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="51024">For GitOps, there are two models of propagating changes; one is a push model and the other is a pull model. </st><st c="51133">In a push model, the GitOps system receives changes as pushes to its API endpoint. </st><st c="51216">It goes without saying that those pushes should be properly authenticated, but we’ll say it anyway to ensure there’s no confusion. </st><st c="51347">After receiving the push, the GitOps system processes the changes and then takes action. </st><st c="51436">That action is probably promoting new software packages to production, but it could also be configuration changes. </st><st c="51551">However, the source of the push is not typically validated with this model, and Argo CD doesn’t have a configuration to validate it. </st><st c="51684">This creates an attack vector because if the credentials are compromised, a bad actor can push changes through the CD system, which can open up additional </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="51839">entry points.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="51852">A pull method is just the opposite. </st><st c="51889">The GitOps system reaches out to the SOT using its authentication and then reads the changes in from the endpoint. </st><st c="52004">Since the source is a known safe source, the application of those changes via automation is considered a safe action. </st><st c="52122">This is not to say a pull model isn’t without risks. </st><st c="52175">Both push and pull models can be subjected to MITM attacks, but in a properly secured network with the correct cryptographic implementations, these risks should be </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="52339">significantly limited.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="52361">When your GitOps system is taking action, it should do so in the most secure way. </st><st c="52444">We’ve already discussed the uses and value of a service account, so it should come as no surprise that your GitOps systems should be expected to leverage service accounts. </st><st c="52616">Those service accounts should also have the minimum amount of access possible while still being able to accomplish the goals of the GitOps implementation in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="52773">the platform.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="52786">Security and </st><a id="_idIndexMarker815"/><st c="52800">GitOps may be an important factor in selecting the GitOps working model for your IDP, and we hope these guidelines are useful when building out GitOps for </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="52955">your organization.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="53610">One aspect of good discipline for security is maintaining accurate documentation and architectural diagrams. </st><st c="53720">If a significant change is made to the application architecture, then that can change the risk surface areas and attack vectors. </st><st c="53849">For example, an undocumented or underdocumented dependency on a library or a network port could result in expos</st><a id="_idTextAnchor420"/><st c="53960">ure to a vulnerability that may be more difficult </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="54011">to determine.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="55786">There are a few reasons to use a floating tag or to use a semantic version release tag instead of a precise SHA. </st><st c="55900">It’s easier to test the continued supportability of a dependency if you’re testing regularly against the latest build. </st><st c="56019">The flexibility that comes from always using the latest version of a known good package may be desirable in a development environment and then could be pinned to a precise version tag or SHA when moving to production. </st><st c="56237">Validating against floating tags can allow a team to be more responsive to security vulnerabilities as well, so a risk assessment of each dependency and a policy should be set to determine what the norms of the application </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56460">will be.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="56468">A typical way of setting a policy would be to use tools such as open source policy agents to catch any deviation from the defined norms and prevent those deviations from entering restricted </st><a id="_idIndexMarker821"/><st c="56659">environments. </st><strong class="bold"><st c="56673">Open Policy Agent</st></strong><st c="56690"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="56692">OPA</st></strong><st c="56695">) and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="56702">Kyverno</st></strong><a id="_idIndexMarker822"/><st c="56709"> are both open source options that are free to use. </st><st c="56761">For both tools, you leverage </st><strong class="bold"><st c="56790">Policy as Code</st></strong><st c="56804"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="56806">PaC</st></strong><st c="56809">), which is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker823"/><st c="56821"> easily reviewed and kept in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="56850">source control.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="60238">One item that came to the platform team for implementation was guaranteeing that all new versions of their software bundle were </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="60367">properly secured.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="62496">However, as important as these restrictions are, they can negatively impact innovation by removing flexibility from the IDP capabilities. </st><st c="62635">For this reason, the platform team has decided to limit these restrictions to the production environment. </st><st c="62741">Doing so allows the development teams to experiment in their dev environments without risking anything that shouldn’t accidentally make it into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="62885">production environments.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="63437">Another action item that might come to the platform team would be to be the first point of contact in the event of a suspected security breach. </st><st c="63582">This means having a way to immediately react to reports of an issue. </st><st c="63651">Since the platform is responsible for so much of the company infrastructure, from development to production capabilities, the team will need to be able to quickly engage in order to mitigate damages caused by a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="63862">bad actor.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="65322">Speaking of that highly secured environment, in order to demonstrate to an auditor the PCI compliance of the organization with the new IDP, our platform team will need to be able to produce a drawing of the network architecture and explain the contents of that drawing to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="65595">the auditor.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="66765">To conclude, security and compliance is a vast space with many experts who have published dedicated works on the subject. </st><st c="66888">This chapter should not be taken as being all-encompassing but should have you started down the correct path to define and execute a cybersecurity strategy for your IDP. </st><st c="67058">It’s important to know how to keep track of vulnerabilities, and have ceremonies and tooling set up within your organization to catch and surface vulnerabilities in the IDP and the applications </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="67252">it hosts.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="67261">While security and flexibility are not natural partners, smart implementations that focus on critical security needs without impeding innovation are the key to providing the developers with the tools they need to be successful and the protections they need to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="67522">be secure.</st></span></p>
