    Salesforce AI implementations may make biased or unfair decisions, potentially
    exposing the organization to reputational or legal risks. This is compounded by
    the difficulty in troubleshooting AI issues. When problems occur, Salesforce administrators
    and developers may struggle to diagnose the root cause due to the opacity of AI
    decision-making processes, which aren’t as transparent as traditional Salesforce
    configurations or Apex code.
