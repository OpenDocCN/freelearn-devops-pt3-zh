<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Resource management</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">: Tags help organize resources by categories, based on products or projects, environments, cost centers, business units, and others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">This makes it easier to search for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">particular resources.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Security and compliance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">: Tags can be used to enforce identity and access policies and control access to resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">For example, if a resource tag describes a database holding credit card information, we can implement a policy ensuring that humans cannot read </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">the data.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Automation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">: Tags can be used to drive deployment and auto-scaling behavior or automated shutdown </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">of resources.</span></span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Even if tagging is as simple as describing key-value pairs, many things can still go wrong, and we will discuss </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">two anti-patterns.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Common anti-patterns</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Tagging-related anti-patterns often start with shortcomings in our tagging standards or tagging enforcement, and we will look into these </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">areas next.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Lack of tagging standards</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">The first one is the lack of tagging</span><a id="_idIndexMarker480"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> standards, which I have seen many times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">There are several reasons why this anti-pattern can occur. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">It could be that cloud native adoption did not get enough focus because an organization is trying to increase its cloud footprint organically and is never gaining momentum for cloud migrations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.4">It could be because a company is trapped in a reactive mode and cannot operate strategically or because of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">competing priorities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">This is how things usually unfold. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">An organization is adopting the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">However, the cloud adoption model has gaps, especially in governance, automation, standardization, and service catalog offerings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">As a result, decentralized product teams are provisioning cloud resources and managing them differently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.5">Applying tags is optional. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.6">Even though teams will eventually decide to apply tags, the tags between teams will not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">be consistent.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">That means we will have resources that are not tagged at all or only have some tags, and there is a high chance that the tags themselves are inconsistent, whether it is the key, the value, or both. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">Therefore, we will miss out on many FinOps guardrails, which we will analyze after the second variation of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">this anti-pattern.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Lack of tagging enforcement</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">The second variation is that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker481"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">there are mandated tagging standards but they are not enforced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">As a result, we will probably have better tagging coverage than the previous variation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">However, we still rely on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">human perfection.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Every engineer must ensure they have all tags assigned to each cloud resource. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">That means the key and the value need to be a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">perfect match.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">During a consulting engagement, I analyzed the tags in place across different cloud environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">Over time, the tag for the cost center had changed multiple times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">The customer used the following combinations for the key: “cost-centre” (UK spelling), “cost-center” (US spelling), “costcentre” (all lower case), “CostCentre” (Pascal case syntax), “costcentre,” </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">and “costcenter.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Because tags are case-sensitive in AWS, this resulted in six different tag categories. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Therefore, the billing report also visualized them in six different variations, requiring manual rectification to achieve a cost breakdown. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">Another common mistake is to use names for the product owner tag value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.4">The individual then leaves the organization and their account gets deactivated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.5">We then have an invalid tag and do not even know in which department the previous application owner was. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.6">This makes it hard to track down the new application owner, assuming there is no </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">ownership vacuum.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">As we can imagine, this is not an exciting activity that must be performed every month and adds the risk of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">human error.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Consequences of poor tagging practices</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">There are several impacts if </span><a id="_idIndexMarker482"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">consequences” we do not have sufficient tagging </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">in place:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Cost allocation becomes challenging</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">: We cannot allocate cost to cost centers, profit centers, or departments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">This makes it difficult to track and manage budgets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">A common result of unclear cost allocation is the lack of ownership </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">and accountability.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Cost optimization becomes challenging</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">: Without sufficient tagging, we will have difficulties identifying the owner of underutilized or unused resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Therefore, no one will act to right-size resources or turn off </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">unnecessary ones.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Inaccurate financial reporting</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">: Financial reports rely on accurate tagging. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">This means we need to manually allocate costs or accept inaccuracy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">In the latter case, that means we cannot fairly distribute </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">the cost.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Incomplete tagging also results in imprecise budgeting</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">: This can lead to budget overruns and insufficient forecasting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Without a correct reflection of our current spending, we will struggle to predict </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">future expenses.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Insufficient showback or chargeback processes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">: “Chargeback </span><a id="_idIndexMarker483"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">consequences” models, where costs are billed back to the departments or product teams that incurred them, rely heavily on accurate tagging. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">Without accurate tagging, implementing a fair and transparent chargeback system is challenging and requires a lot of human data wrangling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.3">With showback models, departments are shown their cloud spending without actual billing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.4">Insufficient tagging can reduce transparency, leading to disputes, confusion, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">potentially mistrust.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">Lack of ownership</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">: Without a functioning chargeback process, there cannot be clear ownership, which is critical for good value realization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">Therefore, we will miss out on good FinOps practices, including overspending, because we have underutilized </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">cloud resources.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Lack of policy enforcement</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">: Cloud governance policies often depend on tags to enforce rules and best practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Insufficient tagging can weaken governance, leading to uncontrolled costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">Tags provide visibility into how resources are being used across the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.4">Without them, it is difficult to ensure resources are </span><a id="_idIndexMarker484"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">consequences” used efficiently and according </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">to policies.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Common root causes of inadequate </span><a id="_idIndexMarker485"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">tagging are inconsistent deployment methods, a lack of leveraging a policy-as-code framework, a lack of tagging standards, and a lack of automation that misses out on tagging enforcement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">Validating the tag keys and values will bring us certainty. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">There are different ways how to do that depending on the CSP We will look into it now by starting </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">with AWS.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">The major CSPs offer various FinOps services, including cost analysis tools, cost reports, budget management, rightsizing recommendations, savings plans, cost trend analysis, forecasting, and alerting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">The offerings are mature but not always used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.3">That is especially the case if cost savings do not become a high priority because other challenges like security, resilience, and compliance must be tackled first. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.4">Before we explore the anti-pattern, we want to make it clear that commercial third-party cost management tools can have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">their place.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">Two main drivers can trigger us to consider third-party tools for cost management and FinOps practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">The first one is if we have a multi-cloud or poly-cloud strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.3">In that case, we might want a unified view across multiple clouds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.4">This will depend on our operating model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.5">If we are prepared to use different FinOps services per cloud (for example, GCP and Azure), then we don’t need to go down that track. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.6">This will add cost management complexity if a team is using several cloud platforms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.7">This could be a centralized cloud platform team that is responsible for creating </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">cost dashboards.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">The second driver is whether we want to include more than our CSP platform in our FinOps approach – for example, to include CI/CD tooling or SaaS monitoring solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">In that case, we must define our requirements and assess the benefit of third-party tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.3">Some CI/CD tools have native cost control features, such as GitHub with a Plans and Usage feature. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.4">If we are OK with looking into several dashboards, we probably do not need to invest in another FinOps third-party tool. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.5">We need to consider the cost trade-off. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.6">How much additional time do we spend on our processes compared to license fees for a commercial offering? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.7">Now, it is time to explore how we can find ourselves in the anti-pattern of not leveraging cloud native </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">FinOps services.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">If we had given cost management a higher priority, we could have had alerts and reacted proactively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.2">Instead, we were reacting to emails we got from AWS and involved procurement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.3">They were not prepared to react swiftly since the government organization had strict processes in place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.4">Eventually, the payment method was moved from credit card payments to an ongoing purchase order. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.5">However, cost controls were only implemented a year later using the cloud </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">native capabilities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">After a couple of months, a project manager asked me to change the billing currency from </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">US dollars</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">USD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">) to Australian dollars, which I did. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">Unfortunately, the procurement department was not prepared to pay the next invoice since the currency did not match the currency in the purchase order. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.3">This is another hiccup we can avoid if we are familiar with our internal cost management practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.4">Collaboration between departments helps to cross those organizational boundaries. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.5">An approach we have seen working well is having a cross-functional team that has regular cadence meetings with extended team delegates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.6">Those delegates include procurement, finance, and recruitment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.7">This helps to catch any surprises early and address them swiftly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.8">This story should make one thing very clear: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">tooling is only a part of a successful FinOps adoption</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">It is critical to have clear processes and responsibilities defined as part of our operating model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.3">Now is the time to investigate another variation of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">this anti-pattern.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">Rushing into a third-party product</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">We already explored the reasons why a commercial third-party offering might make sense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.2">We will now examine a scenario where one is not required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.3">Both scenarios have one thing in common: a low cloud adoption maturity level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.4">In this variation, we want to achieve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">quick wins.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">That could be the case because value realization has never become a high priority due to other burning issues, like security, compliance, and reliability (especially after outages). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">Another driver </span><a id="_idIndexMarker514"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">could be that we are changing our financial approach from a cost center to a profit center approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.2">Because we need to rush, we are not considering the long-term cost </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">impact enough.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">In a previous company, I was in a situation where we had already implemented the foundational cost management capabilities in a development organization, including cost breakdown, forecast, budget alerts, anomaly detection, and committed savings plan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">Unfortunately, the cloud platform team was totally swamped with helping other teams and did not have enough time to fine-tune to rigorously test those features to release them into the production organization for all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">business units.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">In the meantime, a new financial year commenced, and the company changed from a cost center to a profit center approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.2">That meant the costs needed to be distributed accurately. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.3">However, there were gaps in the tagging implementation for legacy applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.4">Therefore, a team manager had to spend more than a day per month getting the cloud bill splitting right. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.5">The </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">leadership team</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">LT</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">) became </span><a id="_idIndexMarker515"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">aware of that but they only knew half the story. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.2">They underestimated the business benefit of the existing cost management service catalog items that were already deployed in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">production organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">One of the LT members attended a conference and saw a presentation of a FinOps tool with a nice user interface. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.2">He was curious and asked some questions after the presentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.3">That was enough for the sales team to flag the company as a hot opportunity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.4">The vendor followed up with a lunch invite. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.5">Judging by how much the product appreciation increased, it must have been a very good lunch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.6">As a next step, there was a very strong desire to implement a proof of value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.7">Because the company was operating in a very regulated environment, this resulted in a comprehensive vendor </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">selection process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">This pattern results in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker516"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">locking ourselves into an ongoing expense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.2">Third-party FinOps license fees are typically based on our cloud spending. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.3">The higher the cloud spending, the more we pay for our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">commercial tool.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">Impacts</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">By going through the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker517"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">anti-pattern, we have already seen some of its consequences, and we want to briefly summarize </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">them now:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">Lack of value optimization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">: If we are not using a FinOps tool, we cannot optimize the value of our cloud native stack. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.2">We will not be able to optimize our resources and make the right financial trade-off decisions, for instance, about whether to opt for a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">savings plan.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">Lack of cost visibility</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">: We will not be able to provide an efficient and correct charge-back approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.2">Therefore, we cannot direct ownership toward the business stakeholder, which means there is no motivation to optimize the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">value realization.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">Increased vendor management effort</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">: If we use a third-party product, we will have an additional vendor that needs to be managed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">We have talked about partnerships before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.3">Is this a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">strategic partnership?</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">Increased ongoing cost</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">: If we use third-party tools, we will be charged a license fee, which is typically based on our cloud spending. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.2">The more we spend, the more we pay for the license. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.3">The provider has no incentive to reduce our cloud costs because that would also reduce </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">their revenue.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">Manual overhead and delays in financial reporting</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">: We will have an increased manual effort to manage our financial reporting, which will also take longer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">Hence, it will be difficult to understand real-time expenses or adjust budgets and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker518"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">forecasts accordingly.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">Even if we have the right tooling in place, we still need to establish mature processes and responsibilities that align with our operating model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.2">Otherwise, we will not unlock the potential of our tooling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.3">We will explore the process and cloud native </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">services next.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.1">Ingesting data into our cloud typically does not result in data transfer fees because CSPs want to attract customers to bring more applications into their cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.2">However, this is different for other transfer cost types, and some have the potential to be underestimated or even overlooked. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.3">We will go through common categories that can cause surprises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.4">The prices themselves keep changing, so we will look into areas that need to be considered rather than </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1">particular prices:</span></span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">Transfer fees between regions and cross-region architecture impacts</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">: Data transfer between regions involves transfer fees. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.2">Similar to the preceding example, the price depends on the origin and destination regions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.3">Cross-region replications are common when we have ambitious DR goals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.4">A complete region outage can happen, but it is very unlikely. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.5">A cross-region DR strategy can protect us from that risk. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.6">Data transfer fees within the same continent are usually lower compared to cross-continent </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">data replications.</span></span></li>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1">The cross-region inconsistency price tag</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">An aspect that is often overlooked is that there is not necessarily a feature parity between regions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.2">A service might not exist in the secondary region, or the service does exist but only has a subset </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">of features.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1">I </span><a id="_idIndexMarker550"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.1">encountered that during a previous consultant engagement when the serverless DB offering existed in both regions, but one region was lacking several features, including an out-of-the-box point-in-time recovery. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.2">Therefore, the second region required a different design, different IaC, and different DR testing scenarios. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.3">This additional design, build, and operational effort is not visible on the cloud bill. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.4">However, our teams will need to dedicate more time and pay great attention to detail, and the operations </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.1">risk increases.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">Architectural multi-region DR strategy impacts</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">If we have not considered multi-region data transfer fees, we will realize that the cost of our multi-region DR strategy significantly exceeds the budget. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.2">This will depend on the risk/cost trade-off decision we need to make. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.3">If we decide to rectify the solution and move to a single-region DR solution, then we need to adjust our architecture and implementation and migrate the existing backups to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1">primary region.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1">Architectural multi-cloud strategy impacts</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">If we have a multi-cloud strategy where we need to continuously transfer data between CSPs, the data transfer fees will be shocking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.2">If we haven’t considered this in our CSP selection process, then we have made an architecture decision that is difficult to revert, especially if we have progressed in our cloud adoption for a significant amount </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1">of time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.1">In this case, we need to make a trade-off decision between long-term cost savings, reducing operational complexity, and increased migration and testing efforts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.2">Another critical point to consider is the architectural benefits we </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.1">could gain.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">A common consequence of multi-cloud adoptions is that only the common denominator is used across clouds to make sure we have a consistent approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.2">For example, everything needs to be on a virtual machine or a container. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.3">Therefore, we cannot utilize the full cloud native potential, such as managed API gateways or DBs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.4">This increases the operational complexity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.5">By unwinding a multi-cloud strategy, we can leverage </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.1">those benefits.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.1">Increased cloud runtime cost</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.1">This is the most obvious impact. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.2">The cost will be higher than we budgeted for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.3">If we don’t adjust our architecture, this will have a long-term impact that will only get worse when we move more applications to the cloud or when the applications become more popular and create </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.1">more traffic.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.1">Other impacts</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1">If we have many idle resources, such as disk volumes that are not attached to a virtual machine, it will be difficult to identify the right resources during an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.2">The idle resources will still be relevant for an external audit and will trigger additional administrative effort. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.3">If we have idle virtual machines running, this will also unnecessarily increase the carbon footprint impacting potential </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">sustainability goals.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1">Those are the key impacts, and we definitely want to avoid them if the business benefits do not match or exceed the additional cost. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.2">Some signs should trigger us to investigate further, and we will </span><a id="_idIndexMarker551"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">look into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1">them next.</span></span></p>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.756.1">Penny pinching</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.1">Going for a bargain can sometimes be tempting; everyone has done it before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.2">The comparison is easy when we get the same product and quality for a reduced price. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.3">It becomes more complex when dealing with cloud native solutions and the long-term operational aspects we </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.1">must consider.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.1">A couple of years ago, I worked with an engineer who ran a cloud hosting business on the side. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.2">His target group was small businesses that needed managed applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.3">The engineer was managing parts of the top half of the shared responsibility model, which is security in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.4">The customer offering included a standard three-tier web architecture with public and private subnets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.5">The private subnets needed outbound connectivity to the internet for some reason. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.6">This was also a security anti-pattern, but we now focus on leveraging </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.760.1">business value.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.761.1">To establish the connectivity from the private subnet to the internet, a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.762.1">NAT gateway</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.763.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.764.1">NAT-GW</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.765.1">) solution </span><a id="_idIndexMarker561"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.766.1">was required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.766.2">The engineer compared the prices of the CSPs’ fully managed NAT-GW services and the cost of hand-crafting a NAT-GW solution from scratch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.766.3">A fully managed service comes with additional costs that cover ongoing patching, high availability, security controls, out-of-the-box logging and monitoring integration, and much more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.766.4">Nevertheless, he decided to go ahead with the hand-crafted solution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.766.5">That meant he had to manage the ongoing image updates for the virtual machine, the ongoing patching process, the security controls, the logging and monitoring, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.767.1">so on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.768.1">That solution would also result in a lot of additional compliance effort for a regulated solution since they needed proof of things such as least privilege enforcement, log integrity, logging of elevated user access, and much more, even though this was only a small-scale hosting business with only </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.769.1">100 customers.</span></span></p>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.1">Not investing in continuous improvement</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.776.1">In a previous </span><a id="_idIndexMarker563"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.777.1">engagement, I worked for a customer that had to meet several regulatory requirements because they were a financial services organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.777.2">Collecting the required evidence manually for an external audit took 3.5 months in one year. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.777.3">This was a full-time effort for one cloud team member assigned to the audit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.777.4">This time span covered the cloud stack. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.777.5">Other teams were involved in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.778.1">on-premises workloads.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.1">Screenshots, log file examples, and process descriptions were to be provided for all environments handling credit card information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.2">The cloud team relied mainly on external resources from consultancies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.3">Therefore, the internal staff was reduced to a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.1">bare minimum.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.1">We already knew we had to improve our approach for the next year and shift toward automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.2">We evaluated several SaaS tools that could help improve the security and compliance posture and reduce the audit effort to the bare minimum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.3">If our organization is in good shape, we can provide the external auditor with read-only access to the compliance automation tool. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.4">They can then validate that the required controls are in place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.5">This means the overall effort on both sides is reduced, but we can also get ongoing assurance insights that help us </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.1">continuously improve.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.783.1">Unfortunately, the company decided not to invest in continuous improvement and allocated the budget to other initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.783.2">The following external audit was even more challenging. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.783.3">Instead of the previous version of the compliance framework, we had to adhere to a new version, which was more thorough. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.783.4">It increased the overall effort, and we had to hire a contractor for 3.5 months to meet the audit timeline and ensure the under-staffed cloud team was still functioning and could continue maturing the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.1">cloud platform.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.1">The key takeaway is that the overall spending for an additional temporary resource to add a couple of band-aids could have been invested into a strategic improvement that would have resulted in a sustainable solution and reduced the long-term effort. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.2">Getting things wrong is not unusual, but we need to use what we have learned to improve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.3">Making the same error twice in a row is painful to watch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.4">In hindsight, it felt like watching a car crash in slow motion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.5">Thankfully, no physical harm occurred, but the pain was not forgotten. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.6">Let’s move on and summarize and quantify the impacts of focusing on cost savings rather than </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.1">driving value.</span></span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.791.1">Missed business opportunities</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.1">: If we do not drive the improvement of our value chain, we will miss out on customer experience improvements that can differentiate us from the competition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.2">If we do not continuously improve our cloud native stack, we will increase our tech debt, and the time to market for current features will decrease. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.3">This will be a disadvantage if we want to innovate, react to market changes, or comply with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.793.1">regulatory requirements.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.794.1">Increased operational complexity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.1">: Without continuous improvement, we will miss out on fully leveraging the cloud potential. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.2">Managed services are being innovated and improved at a much quicker pace compared to what we could achieve ourselves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.3">If we do not refresh our architecture, it will be out of date soon. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.4">These operational benefits of managed services include built-in observability and resilience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.5">The avoidable increased operational complexity will burden our teams since the operational effort will be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.1">unnecessarily high.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.797.1">Decreased productivity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.1">: Penny-pinching can negatively impact a team’s morale. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.2">The result will be less engagement, motivation, and collaboration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.3">Therefore, productivity will be lower than it could be when we aim for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.1">value creation.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.800.1">Compromised security and compliance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.801.1">: Solely focusing on cost reduction can lead to underinvestment in security tools, monitoring, and compliance services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.801.2">This increases the risk of security breaches, data loss, and non-compliance with regulations, which can have significant impacts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.801.3">Not enabling services such as network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or vulnerability scanning will expose our applications to vulnerabilities and result in non-compliance with regulatory frameworks </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.802.1">like PCI-DSS.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.803.1">Reduced user experience</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.1">: Cost-cutting measures can negatively impact service reliability and availability, leading to dissatisfied customers and potential churn. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.2">Reducing redundancy or backup frequencies to save costs might result in service outages or data loss, impacting reliability and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.1">customer experience.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.806.1">Loss of revenue and growth potential</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.807.1">: Minimizing cloud spending can impact our architecture and restrict our ability to scale quickly for demand peaks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.807.2">This can limit our ability to leverage ad hoc market opportunities, such as trading spikes due to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker565"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.808.1"> business news or temporary retail peaks like on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.1">Black Friday.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.1">Focusing on cost optimization has significant impacts and can damage our business and reputation in the long term. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.2">But how can we realize we are on the wrong path and must react? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.3">We will look into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.811.1">this next.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.1">Problem indicators</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.813.1">It is not always easy to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker566"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.1">realize whether we are already en route for this anti-pattern, and therefore, we will explore some of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.815.1">early signs:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.816.1">Service downgrades and performance issues</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.817.1">: Growing complaints about slow application performance, higher latency, or frequent service outages can indicate a focus on cost reduction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.817.2">Performance degradation due to under-provisioned resources, such as a lack of auto-scaling or edge computing, indicates that cost is prioritized over </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.1">business outcomes.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.819.1">Reducing security controls</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.820.1">: Reducing investment in cloud security tools, services, or personnel or a noticeable decline in security monitoring and compliance activities are signs of cost reaction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.820.2">These measures can increase the risk of data breaches and compliance failures, demonstrating a dangerous trade-off between cost savings and essential </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.821.1">security controls.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.822.1">Lack of standardization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.823.1">: Immature standardizations include a lack of coding standards, standardized CI/CD pipelines, container-based images, service catalog offerings, and others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.823.2">The consequence is increased operational complexity and a slower time to market, which will decrease </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.1">value creation.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.825.1">Lack of chargeback and accountability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.1">: Without a chargeback model, we do not have clear responsibilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.2">Therefore, the product teams will not drive the ROI. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.3">In that case, we will likely have a centralized cost-focused governance approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.4">An </span><a id="_idIndexMarker567"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.827.1">immature operating model also falls under </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.828.1">this category.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.1">What does good look like, and how do we get there?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.1">We need to tackle the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker568"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.831.1"> following problem spaces to achieve a valuable outcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.831.2">If we tackle these challenges in time and sufficiently, they become </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.1">enabling areas:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.833.1">Ownership and accountability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.1">: Clear demarcation of responsibilities is required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.2">The cloud platform team might be responsible for establishing all network infrastructure and managing the service catalog. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.3">The product team will be responsible for the application, data, and ongoing optimizations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.4">This includes right-sizing compute instances and deciding which backup and data life cycle plans must be used to meet all requirements and avoid underutilization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.5">Establishing a chargeback model will help drive economic behavior. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.6">This brings us to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.835.1">next point.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.836.1">Committed spend and spot virtual machines</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.1">: Ownership and accountability will also trigger cost-saving thinking within product teams because cloud costs saved can be spent on innovation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.2">If the teams understand their responsibility, they will be interested in leveraging cost-commit plans to leverage discounts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.3">It will also trigger spot instances for test environments or batch jobs that can afford interruptions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.4">Spot virtual machines are cheaper to run compared to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.838.1">on-demand instances.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.839.1">Taking a long-term delivery view</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.840.1">: Projects have a short-term view because they only plan for the project’s time span. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.840.2">Afterward, the project will be moved to BAU status, and an operations team will operate it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.840.3">However, the solution might not necessarily improve over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.840.4">This results in insufficient legacy architectures that do not leverage the latest cloud native features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.840.5">Moving to a product team approach brings operational responsibility closer to the product team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.840.6">The product team will be very interested in reducing the operational complexity and continuously improving </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.841.1">the application.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.842.1">Technical debt register</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.1">: It will help us keep track of any tactical decisions we make. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.2">This could be an old Java runtime that we are using or a DB engine that is not our strategic choice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.3">If we later create a new application container image with a newer runtime, we can remediate the technical debt because we will have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.1">clear visibility.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.845.1">Data insights</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.1">: Rather than just focusing on the total cloud cost, we get a better picture when we have data points and can build correlations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.2">That way, we can find out how much the online sales number increases because we can release more frequently, as we invested more into our CI/CD </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.847.1">pipeline maturity.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.848.1">Partner ecosystem</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.849.1">: Having</span><a id="_idIndexMarker569"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.1"> a partner strategy in place is a good starting point, but we also need to make sure we build a good relationship. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.2">Partners such as CSPs, SaaS vendors, or consultancies are experts in the field, and they can provide valuable advice on what we can improve or where we can co-innovate to create new </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.851.1">business opportunities.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.852.1">Investing in long-term gains</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.1">: A short-sighted view of expenses will result in missed strategic opportunities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.2">If we assess the value of mature CI/CD pipelines that provide repeatable, secure, and reliable outcomes, we can reduce our time to market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.3">Examples include automated performance, reliability, or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.854.1">regression tests.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.855.1">Temporary environments and auto-destroy</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.856.1">: Establishing sandpits where developers can experiment with new cloud services or the CI/CD toolchain will contribute to education. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.856.2">Sandpits bring the risk of a cost surprise because, typically, not all resources get destroyed after they are no longer needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.856.3">We can implement an auto-destroy mechanism to make sure resources can be removed at certain time intervals, for example, every weekend. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.856.4">We can do this with cloud native CI/CD tooling, SaaS solutions, or open source solutions such as AWS Nuke. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.856.5">The implementation is an upfront investment, but it will eventually pay off. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.856.6">The same </span><a id="_idIndexMarker570"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.857.1">applies to temporary environments that can be shut down outside </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.858.1">business hours.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.859.1">We explored a lot in this chapter and will now summarize what we learned so that we can digest the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.860.1">information quickly.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.861.1">Summary</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.1">We started with tagging, our daily bread and butter, to achieve an accurate cost breakdown. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.2">We need clear tagging standards and enforcement to establish a functioning chargeback model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.3">We explored cloud native FinOps services such as cost explorers, budgets, alerts, and cost anomaly detections. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.4">Those are valuable features for gaining early insight and cost alerts rather than passively waiting for the next cloud bill shock. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.5">We explored data transfer fees and how they can occur within our cloud platform and for hybrid or multi-cloud traffic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.6">We then closed by exploring business value creation instead of taking a short-term cost minimization stance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.7">Only a long-term perspective can help us maximize the business value we can achieve with our cloud </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.863.1">native stack.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.864.1">Now, we are ready to tackle the next challenge, which is security and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.865.1">compliance goals.</span></span></p>
