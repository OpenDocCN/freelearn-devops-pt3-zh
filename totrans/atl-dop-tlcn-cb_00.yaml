    where they work and interact: people, processes, and tools. Changes for people
    may include changes in organizational makeup or culture. Process change may include
    the addition of practices seen in Lean Thinking to ensure continuous delivery.
    Tool changes allow for quicker turnarounds through automation.'

- en: The tools produced by Atlassian can certainly aid our teams with improving processes
    and fostering automation. Key tools such as Jira and Confluence allow teams to
    establish standard processes that promote agility and Lean Thinking. Bitbucket
    Cloud, with its introduction of Bitbucket Pipelines, not only fosters version
    control but also allows for automation to establish continuous integration and
    continuous deployment.

- en: But the hallmark of the Atlassian tools isn’t the tools themselves; it’s the
    ease to which they can connect to each other and to other tools from different
    manufacturers. Atlassian’s Open DevOps platform provides the ability to create
    easy interconnections, regardless of vendor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The focus of this book is not any singular Atlassian product, such as Jira or
    Confluence. Rather, this book looks to highlight the ease of interconnecting Atlassian
    tools with other Atlassian tools or other development tools such as GitLab, GitHub,
    Snyk, and LaunchDarkly. The hope is that by reading this book, you can combine
    your Atlassian investment with your other investments to create a robust toolchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We begin with the assumption that your organization’s current state of tools
    includes tools from Atlassian and other vendors. Because of this, we do not advise
    reading this book sequentially. We feel the best use of this book is to read the
    chapters that apply to connecting your tools, without worrying about making an
    Atlassian-only stack. These incremental changes follow a Lean approach that is
    key to adopting DevOps.

    toolchain looks like in [*Chapter 13*](B21937_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor258). While
    the sample uses mostly Atlassian tools, it can be made with any combination of
    tools.

    interest are the connections that Atlassian tools can make with each other and
    with tools from other manufacturers.

- en: We set the stage for our exploration of DevOps and toolchains by understanding
    the background and context of why this approach is needed. Once we have discovered
    the “why” of DevOps, we shift attention to Jira and the connections it can make
    through the Open DevOps platform. We discover how to configure Jira to connect
    with other tools using this platform.

- en: Before any implementation begins, developers have to work with product managers,
    stakeholders, and perhaps even the customer to determine the need, viability,
    and feasibility of a new product. Jira Product Discovery aids this effort of determining
    which ideas should be acted on by providing a location for collecting, tracking,
    elaborating, and comparing different ideas for products and features. Those ideas
    that are ready can be linked to a Jira issue to monitor development.

- en: As we start development, we need to plan our efforts and ensure our efforts
    are on track. We also want to ensure that the development efforts link to the
    overall big picture of the product and its promise of value. To that end, we will
    connect Jira to Confluence so that Confluence can provide the necessary project
    documentation.
