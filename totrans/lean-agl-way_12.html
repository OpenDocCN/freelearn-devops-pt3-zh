			<h1 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor512"/>Addressing labor’s declining share of GDP</h1>
			<p>Did you know that<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> the U.S. market share for manufactured goods by domestic producers has been declining steadily for the past 20 years? According to the CPA Domestic Market Share Index, it reached a record low of 66% in 2022. A critical issue cited is a two-thirds fall in labor’s share of U.S. GDP. Economists cite three main factors contributing to <span class="No-Break">this decline:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Weak productivity growth</strong>: Sluggish productivity growth significantly impacts labor’s share, accounting for half of the <span class="No-Break">decline. </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_12.xhtml#endnote-002"><span id="endnote-002-backlink">2</span></a></span></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Income inequality</strong>: The widening gap between average and median wages contributes to the decline, representing 19% of the overall gap in labor’s <span class="No-Break">share. </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_12.xhtml#endnote-003"><span id="endnote-003-backlink">3</span></a></span></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technological progress</strong>: Unequal effects on labor and capital due to biased technological change play a role. Capital deepening (increased capital relative to labor) is a contributing <span class="No-Break">mechanism. </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="B21818_12.xhtml#endnote-004"><span id="endnote-004-backlink">4</span></a></span></span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This alarming trend underscores the pressing need for organizations to return to the basics of Lean production practices. Additionally, they must incorporate Agile practices that originated within the  software industry to adapt and evolve through digital innovations across products, services, and business-enabling systems. Together, these strategies help organizations navigate the complexities of the global economy effectively and <span class="No-Break">remain competitive.</span></p>
			<p>That’s a bold statement and a tall task to undertake. So, let’s explore how responsible Lean-Agile enterprises and society can collaborate to address these <span class="No-Break">vital challenges.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor513"/>Promoting corporate responsibility through Lean-Agile practices</h2>
			<p>Henry Ford famously<a id="_idIndexMarker928"/> understood the importance of fair wages for his employees, recognizing that they needed to be able to afford the products they were creating. Otherwise, he would have no customers for his automobiles. This principle of enlightened management is crucial today, where businesses must bear responsibility for broader societal issues such as income deficiencies and technological disruptions. Lean-Agile practices offer a <a id="_idIndexMarker929"/>framework for addressing these challenges while also driving <span class="No-Break">business success.</span></p>
			<h3>Addressing income inequality</h3>
			<p>Leaders and shareholders in Lean-Agile enterprises should recognize their responsibility to pay fair wages based on the skills and expertise of their employees.  Fair compensation is not only a moral obligation but also a strategic necessity. By ensuring that their employees are fairly compensated, companies help foster a robust economy filled with prospective customers who have the financial resources to purchase their products and services. Additionally, by ensuring that employees are fairly compensated, businesses can foster a more motivated and loyal workforce, ultimately contributing to a more stable and prosperous outcome. This approach recognizes that the very people who contribute to the company’s success are also its customers, sustaining the market for their products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<h3>Navigating technological progress</h3>
			<p>While Lean-Agile enterprises <a id="_idIndexMarker930"/>can leverage technology to enhance efficiency and value delivery, society must address the broader implications of technological progress. Ensuring that technology does not displace workers at the expense of the economy is a collective challenge. Businesses, policymakers, and communities need to work together to create solutions that balance technological advancement with job security and economic stability. This collaborative effort will help mitigate the risks of automation and ensure that technological progress <span class="No-Break">benefits everyone.</span></p>
			<p>The employment of Lean practices, combined with technology enhancements, helps businesses eliminate inefficiencies, reduce unnecessary inventories, minimize defects, and empower employees to participate in problem-solving and decision-making. Additionally, the adaptability of Agile practices ensures that these types of improvements become a continuous process. This holistic approach ensures that organizations contribute positively to society while achieving their strategic goals, ultimately fostering a sustainable and prosperous future for both the company and its customers. The key to continuity is understanding that technology, including AI, cannot be viewed as a replacement for people but as an enabler for them. People drive our economy through their purchases, so we need to view technology as a means to expand our economy by freeing up resources to deliver new products and services that we haven’t yet <span class="No-Break">thought of.</span></p>
			<p>Having addressed the two-thirds decline in labor’s share of U.S. GDP and how Lean-Agile enterprises can respond, let’s conclude this book with a recap of what you have learned, including cross-cutting themes. We will also provide three real-world case studies where Lean-Agile practices have improved <span class="No-Break">business operations.</span></p>

This streamlined approach to value stream management enhances operational efficiency, eliminates waste, and maximizes value delivery, ultimately <a id="_idIndexMarker973"/>improving<a id="_idIndexMarker974"/> customer satisfaction and <span class="No-Break">organizational effectiveness.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor526"/>Leonardo Worldwide VSM case study</h2>
			<p>We now offer a second <a id="_idIndexMarker975"/>case study – that of a software technology firm, <strong class="bold">Leonardo Worldwide</strong>, supporting the travel industry. In this case, the company provides content management and <span class="No-Break">distribution software.</span></p>
			<h3>A travel tech leader’s leap toward Agile efficiency</h3>
			<p>This case study depicts a performance improvement effort within a larger, long-term transformation that was struggling to deliver compelling business results. The company needed a way to improve prioritization and accelerate execution to learn, build, and refactor faster. The executives couldn’t see what was delaying progress, or how individual contributions were impacting the transformation effort. As an experiment, they aimed to dramatically improve an eight-month process to satisfy critical customer requests, which came with a serious churn risk and opportunity cost. Utilizing the capabilities of Leonardo Worldwide’s travel technology platform, the transformation team worked to reduce their Enterprise Feature Request process from 8 months to 3 months with just a few hours of lean value <span class="No-Break">stream mapping</span></p>
			<h3>Challenge encountered</h3>
			<p>Leonardo Worldwide helps hotels and travel channels source, manage, and distribute their content. Transformation within Leonardo was nearing the end of its planned 1.5-year transformation journey, and yet many milestones were still beyond the horizon. The company’s time-to-market metrics were not sufficient to address demand, which was <span class="No-Break">impacting morale.</span></p>
			<p>The current state operating model represented agile cycles inside a waterfall process. As a result, QA, operations, marketing, and support were involved too late in the planning process. There were many meetings, handoffs, and activities involving simple manual work. The company had developed ideal world process documentation, but the reality of their situation was twice as complicated as described in the <span class="No-Break">documented processes.</span></p>
			<p>Recognizing that large-scale change is daunting and prone to failure, the executives and transformation team elected to start small, with a <strong class="bold">Lean Value Stream Mapping</strong> (<strong class="bold">LVSM</strong>) methodology <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>selected as the catalyst to spark awareness, visibility, <span class="No-Break">and change.</span></p>
			<h3>Lean IT with a VSM approach</h3>
			<p>The company embarked on a Lean IT initiative employing Value Stream Mapping to scrutinize and refine its enterprise partner integration process. Simple, lean value stream mapping – completed in a few short hours – was leveraged to identify, and eliminate non-value-adding activities, streamline workflow, and ultimately reduce delivery <span class="No-Break">lead time.</span></p>
			<h3>Implementation</h3>
			<p>The team initiated the process using just a whiteboard and marker, gradually refining their approach over a couple of hours. They then transitioned to utilizing common enterprise productivity software such as Excel and Google Sheets to develop dynamic dashboards, enabling visualization of gaps, tracking progress, and <span class="No-Break">sharing successes.</span></p>
			<p>They opted for a lightweight approach, steering clear of commercial VSM tools. Recognizing that even simple spreadsheets could introduce unintended complexity and impede progress, they <a id="_idIndexMarker977"/>utilized existing, accessible worksheets and document creation and collaboration tools. This allowed them to maintain a delicate balance between structure <span class="No-Break">and simplicity.</span></p>
			<p>To secure executive buy-in and align efforts, the transformation team strategically engaged with business leaders whose key performance indicators were directly impacted by the process. Moreover, they involved other stakeholders who had expressed concerns about the process, fostering buy-in among the <span class="No-Break">remaining skeptics.</span></p>
			<p>Despite their active involvement in transformation discussions, many participants had limited day-to-day interaction with colleagues outside their specific areas of work. This led to surprising discoveries about the significant contributions of other departments to the flow of work and information within the targeted <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<h3>Outcomes achieved</h3>
			<p>The application of VSM and Lean IT principles enabled Leonardo to achieve remarkable improvements in its SDLC process. Let’s explore those improvements in the context of the organization’s critical <span class="No-Break">performance metrics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reduced lead time</strong>: The streamlined process saw a reduction from 8 months on average and 12 months in the worst case, to a consistent three-month flow with sufficient buffering. The reduction marks a 62.5% decrease in typical delivery time and a 75% decrease from the worst-case <span class="No-Break">lead time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhanced efficiency</strong>: The team condensed the process from 23 sequential steps with numerous handoffs to just 6 phases involving parallel activities. They streamlined the number of process reviewers from 12 to 2 individuals – a primary and a backup approver, clarifying roles and ownership. Furthermore, optimizing workflow enabled a reduction in team size from 12 contributors to just 4, facilitating the execution of three parallel <span class="No-Break">efforts concurrently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost savings and additional revenue</strong>: The team demonstrated fully loaded cost savings of 150k /year over 3 years. Additionally, the ability to execute three additional Change Request cycles per year over 3 years presented an additional $720,000 revenue<a id="_idIndexMarker978"/> <span class="No-Break">improvement opportunity.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Applying the cross-cutting themes to Leonardo Worldwide</h3>
			<p>Now let’s look at the transformation team’s outcomes in the context of the cross-cutting themes identified previously in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Emphasizing Agility and adaptability</strong>: Within the context of the VSM case, Leonardo recognized the necessity of agility and adaptability in its IT operations, enabling swift responses to changing demands and improvement opportunities. This focus led to the adoption of flexible processes that could be rapidly adjusted or scaled according to requirements and <span class="No-Break">business needs.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrating Lean and Agile practices</strong>: The integration of Lean and Agile practices allowed Leonardo to enhance its software development lifecycle by combining Lean’s efficiency in measuring value streams with Agile’s iterative approach to management. This holistic strategy ensured a seamless flow of work and improved collaboration <span class="No-Break">across teams.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pursuing continuous improvement</strong>: Leonardo Worldwide’s journey with Value Stream Mapping was underpinned by a commitment to continuous improvement, systematically identifying and eliminating waste in their SDLC process. This ongoing pursuit of operational excellence resulted in significant reductions in delivery time, increased contributor satisfaction, and increased <span class="No-Break">revenue opportunities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prioritizing customer-centricity</strong>: By adopting a Lean-Agile IT approach, Leonardo placed a strong emphasis on customer-centricity, ensuring that every phase of the software development process was aligned with delivering maximum value to customers by maximizing value-added time. This focus led to more efficient service deliveries and products that more closely met customer needs and expectations, in addition to <span class="No-Break">higher efficiency.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Breaking down silos for streamlining value streams</strong>: Leonardo tackled the challenge of organizational silos by breaking down value stream steps and clearly identifying costly handoffs, which often hindered efficient workflow and information exchange. Through value stream mapping, the company identified and removed painful bottlenecks and smoothed handoffs, fostering a culture of collaboration, and <a id="_idIndexMarker979"/>enabling more streamlined and efficient value delivery <span class="No-Break">across departments.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Conclusion and insights</h3>
			<p>After the initial value stream transformation session, team members departed feeling energized and clear about the goals and next steps, with ample energy remaining to fuel the subsequent improvement efforts. Participants expressed surprise at the complexity of the process and the burden it placed on others, emphasizing the widespread presence of waste, delays, and inadequate visibility <span class="No-Break">and measurement.</span></p>
			<p>This case exemplifies a successful application of value stream mapping within a complex enterprise IT environment, highlighting the versatility and effectiveness of Lean-Agile methodologies in enhancing software development processes. Moreover, it underscores the strategic value of embracing a continuous improvement mindset in today’s dynamic business landscape, showcasing not only the tangible benefits, such as reduced cycle times and improved<a id="_idIndexMarker980"/> operational efficiency, but also the broader <span class="No-Break">organizational advantages.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor527"/>BLAST case study</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Basic Lean-Agile Solutions Team</strong> (<strong class="bold">BLAST</strong>) framework revolutionizes how multiple Lean and <a id="_idIndexMarker981"/>Agile teams collaborate on developing solutions. Born out of the necessity to address challenges faced by one of Al Shalloway’s clients, BLAST emerged when they initially attempted to employ a Scaled Scrum approach for orchestrating the work of numerous teams on a sizable software <span class="No-Break">development program.</span></p>
			<p>However, devoid of Lean-oriented concepts, they struggled with discipline, synchronization, and integration of their work. From a Lean-Agile perspective, they lacked both cadence and flow. By analogy, imagine a combustion engine that is not firing in a synchronized manner across all its cylinders. The engine will misfire and <span class="No-Break">potentially seize.</span></p>
			<p>BLAST offers a structured yet flexible approach, emphasizing the alignment of team backlogs to foster a cohesive environment that mitigates delays and enhances <span class="No-Break">workflow efficiency.</span></p>
			<h3>Overview: utilizing alignment for multi-team collaboration</h3>
			<p>BLAST is a value stream-based approach that leverages the alignment of business value backlog to facilitate collaboration among multiple teams. This alignment serves as a cost-effective method of coordinating teams compared to external coordination, fostering a cohesive sense of a larger team, and minimizing delays in workflows <span class="No-Break">between teams.</span></p>
			<p>One of the primary challenges in product development is the occurrence of delays in the workflow. These delays hindered the timely feedback, which is essential for minimizing rework and other unplanned tasks. To address this challenge, the Basic Lean Agile Team employs a combination<a id="_idIndexMarker982"/> of <strong class="bold">Minimum Value Increments</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVIs</strong>), coordinated backlogs, and a shared goal. These elements ensure effective collaboration among teams with diverse skills <span class="No-Break">and responsibilities.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, BLAST implements the Lean-oriented concept of value streams and flows. By incorporating workflows, process automation and integration, and standard Lean practices, BLAST significantly accelerates the delivery of customer-centric value through the organization’s products and services. This approach not only enhances quality, productivity, and efficiency but also ensures a relentless focus on meeting customer needs <span class="No-Break">and expectations.</span></p>
			<p>The genesis of BLAST can be traced back to a pivotal two-day consulting engagement led by Al Shalloway. The next section delves into the circumstances surrounding BLAST’s inception during collaboration with a company experienced in Scrum methodologies at scale yet encountering challenges in realizing <span class="No-Break">value efficiently.</span></p>
			<h3>Discovering the genesis of BLAST</h3>
			<p>BLAST originated during a two-day consulting engagement led by Al Shalloway, involving a company proficient in Scrum methodologies, characterized by two-week sprints, and utilizing practices akin to<a id="_idIndexMarker983"/> Al’s original concepts <a id="_idIndexMarker984"/>around <strong class="bold">Minimum Valuable Increments</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVIs</strong>). In other words, the product teams had the goal of releasing full increments of value as complete features or solutions. Despite receiving training from a well-known, leading Scrum consultant, the client’s product and component teams encountered difficulties in delivering value through their <span class="No-Break">products efficiently.</span></p>
			<p>Their development organization, comprising approximately 150 individuals, was organized into approximately 20 teams, with 2-3 product lines, each encompassing 2-3 products. Additionally, their people had just been reorganized into application teams, components teams supporting the application teams, and a component team supporting all applications (see <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 12</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> as an example of the <span class="No-Break">team orientations).</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer129">
					<img alt="Figure 12.1 – Team compositions and structures" src="image/B21818_12_01.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.1 – Team compositions and structures</p>
			<p>The teams found themselves in a perplexing situation where each team could complete their sprints but struggled to release software solutions promptly. Upon closer examination, they discovered that the teams were diligently performing the tasks they had been instructed <a id="_idIndexMarker985"/>to do. Consequently, they were baffled by the significant delays in releasing the new enhancements they were collectively building as <span class="No-Break">integrated solutions.</span></p>
			<p>After a swift value stream mapping session, a practice not commonly emphasized in Scrum-based methodologies, their issue became apparent. Despite each team performing their tasks competently, prolonged product enhancement projects spanning more than two sprints resulted in considerable time and effort dedicated to component integrations. The root of the problem lay in each team pulling work from the product backlog while selecting tasks optimized for their skills, resources, <span class="No-Break">and availability.</span></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, this approach led to fragmented integration of work across teams, as each team focused on implementing distinct capabilities and failed to coordinate their efforts effectively. This resulted in the delivery of partial components of multiple features within a sprint, rather than complete, customer-centric features. It became evident that they required a more effective approach to planning, coordinating, and integrating their work to deliver value to <span class="No-Break">the customer.</span></p>
			<p>As a side note, it’s important to mention that the client likely needed to reassess its reliance on component teams, as opposed to feature<a id="_idIndexMarker986"/> teams. A <strong class="bold">feature team</strong>, known for its cross-functional and cross-component nature, is responsible for building and providing end-to-end customer features or slices of features. Conversely, a <strong class="bold">component team</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker987"/> specialized team focused on specific components, such as UI, backend development, frontend development, APIs, QA, <span class="No-Break">and testing.</span></p>
			<p>Many organizations opt for component teams based on their existing skills or domain-based organizational structures. However, as a general rule, feature teams tend to work best, facilitating the generation of flow across continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) and<a id="_idIndexMarker988"/> DevOps-based software <span class="No-Break">delivery pipelines.</span></p>
			<p>But let’s get back to our story on the genesis of the BLAST framework. The lack of customer feedback was only part of the problem. The absence of a defined increment of product-oriented value meant that any misunderstandings between the teams could not be detected at the end<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> of the sprint because full features were not <span class="No-Break">completely implemented.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 12</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> illustrates the disconnect created by this component team approach to development across <span class="No-Break">multiple teams.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer130">
					<img alt="Figure 12.2 – Disconnected product team efforts" src="image/B21818_12_02.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2 – Disconnected product team efforts</p>
			<p>Each team pulled work off the product backlog based on what was easiest for them to implement with the skills and resources available in their component-based teams. Consequently, different parts of the required features were pulled regardless of priority. As a result, at the end of each sprint, very little real integration could be achieved, as a complete solution was not available for release. When each team completed their work, they attempted to integrate the entire system, only to discover errors and incorrect assumptions, requiring significant <span class="No-Break">unplanned work.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, new projects in the pipeline meant that any delays on one project adversely affected many others. This introduced further delays and extra, <span class="No-Break">unplanned work.</span></p>
			<p>This client situation became a case study of having quality individuals working at the team level but failing to translate their efforts into delivering quality components across a group of teams building integrated and value-added solutions. Despite genuine efforts to coordinate work across teams, the result created a culture of unproductive micro-management and finger-pointing. Instead, what was needed was for teams to learn to work <span class="No-Break">together naturally.</span></p>
			<p>The key to addressing this was for teams to autonomously pull the required tasks to complete features in a <span class="No-Break">coordinated manner.</span></p>
			<p>The product teams found themselves in this situation by following a process originally designed to support the efforts of one or maybe two Scrum teams working against a single backlog. In this model, the Scrum teams remain reasonably autonomous, cross-functional, and self-managing. However, when multiple teams were tasked with pulling from the same product backlog, they pulled in a way that accelerated value delivery across individual<a id="_idIndexMarker990"/> teams but not for the collective of teams tasked with delivering <span class="No-Break">value-added solutions.</span></p>
			<p>The bottom line is individual team delivery isn’t the point; the goal is to deliver value to customers. Using a single-team approach to coordinate multiple teams with different focuses is <span class="No-Break">rarely successful.</span></p>
			<h3>Leveraging the BLAST framework for team synergy and value delivery</h3>
			<p>The BLAST framework enables multiple teams to work together to deliver value-added solutions. In the BLAST model, some teams use Lean-oriented practices to deliver products and services efficiently, rapidly, and with high quality in a repeatable manner. Meanwhile, other teams adopt Agile’s iterative and incremental development models to solve complex problems, plan new increments and releases, develop new product and service enhancements, and improve business processes <span class="No-Break">and systems.</span></p>
			<p>The BLAST framework also facilitates collaboration with domain experts who support the Agile-based teams where their expertise is needed for requirements gathering, testing, <span class="No-Break">and feedback.</span></p>
			<p>A prime example of this collaboration is modern DevOps software development teams. DevOps builds upon the continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline concepts developed to support the software development process. Both CI/CD and DevOps pipelines utilize technology to integrate, automate, and synchronize software development, delivery, and support processes, end to end. While this approach aligns closely with Lean-oriented development models, new work enters the pipeline on a cadence using <a id="_idIndexMarker991"/>Agile’s <strong class="bold">Iterative and Incremental Development</strong> (<strong class="bold">IID</strong>) approach to gathering requirements, planning feature releases, refining the backlog, and releasing new enhancements <span class="No-Break">to customers.</span></p>
			<p>In our modern software delivery model, the DevOps team collaborates with domain experts, stakeholders, and customers to support their solution delivery efforts. These domain experts also likely work in Lean-oriented work environments to maximize their ability to deliver<a id="_idIndexMarker992"/> value in their areas of work. Effectively, they are loaned out to the Agile-based teams on an ad hoc and <span class="No-Break">as-needed basis.</span></p>
			<p>Aligning with the principles of agility and adaptability, the BLAST framework emphasizes the importance of teams collaborating on a shared backlog to determine which features to prioritize and develop collectively. This approach fosters cohesion among teams, enabling them to focus on interconnected aspects of the product, complete feature components required for integration, and prompt gathering of <span class="No-Break">customer feedback.</span></p>
			<p>This suggests that teams should collaborate on a shared backlog, pulling features together to determine their collective priorities. By doing so, teams can focus on interrelated aspects of the product, ensuring the completion of feature components necessary for integration and facilitating prompt customer feedback. Additionally, this approach minimizes the amount of integration work carried over to subsequent sprints. This type of collaboration creates alignment automatically, thereby reducing the need to coordinate teams. The effect is lower costs while achieving <span class="No-Break">greater efficiency.</span></p>
			<p>So, with this understanding, let’s examine our five cross-cutting Lean-Agile themes to find a better approach for this client to deliver high-value products and services efficiently, rapidly, and with <span class="No-Break">high quality.</span></p>
			<h3>Maximizing value delivery through cross-cutting Lean-Agile themes</h3>
			<p>In the domain of Lean-Agile practices, the pursuit of maximizing value delivery with the available resources is the primary imperative. Embedded within this endeavor are the five cross-cutting themes meticulously discussed throughout our Lean-Agile Mastery book. These themes not only guide the principles of the BLAST framework but also serve as pillars for effective <span class="No-Break">Lean-Agile implementation.</span></p>
			<p>As we observe these themes applied to this client’s situation, it becomes evident how they intertwine with the fabric of BLAST, driving its efficiency and success in delivering value to customers. Let’s delve into each theme, uncovering their significance in shaping Lean-Agile practices<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> within the <span class="No-Break">BLAST framework:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration of Lean and Agile practices</strong>: Coordinated pulling of work items minimized workflow delays between teams, resulting in <span class="No-Break">reduced workloads</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement</strong>: Collaborative efforts allowed teams to enhance their alignment and coordination <span class="No-Break">methods continually</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer-centricity</strong>: Teams shifted their focus from individual responsibilities to prioritizing <span class="No-Break">customer value</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Breaking down silos with streamlined value streams</strong>: Teams ceased operating in isolation and instead collaborated to deliver value to the customer <span class="No-Break">more efficiently</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Essentially, BLAST was born! An interesting observation is what prompted the client to recognize the necessary course of action and why it wasn’t apparent to <span class="No-Break">them earlier.</span></p>
			<p>One reason is that Scrum lacks an in-depth theory about the first principles of knowledge work. An example of the first principle of knowledge work is understanding how information is processed and utilized within a team or organization to achieve its objectives. Instead, Scrum relies on predetermined practices such as sprints, cross-functional teams, events, and values. A mantra of Scrum is that teams are self-managing, focusing on what’s best for the <span class="No-Break">team individually.</span></p>
			<p>So, this approach led to local optimization within the client’s product and component teams, resulting in high integration costs. On the positive side, as team leaders realized this was working against them, they saw the value in considering themselves as part of “one <span class="No-Break">big team.”</span></p>
			<p>Presenting them with a value stream map illustrating their workflow and the benefits of alignment through a common backlog provided the insights needed to change <span class="No-Break">their approach.</span></p>
			<p>The following list highlights BLAST's <span class="No-Break">scaling approach:</span></p>
