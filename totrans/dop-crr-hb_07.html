			<h1 id="_idParaDest-100"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Chapter 5</em>: Building Your Network</h1>
			<p>My current job is great. I enjoy the work I am doing, I am learning every day, and I have a great manager; a true triple-threat job. You may be thinking I had to work extremely hard to get this job. In a way I did, but not in the way you are probably thinking. I did not work hard to prepare for the interviews, as most of the interviews happened without me even knowing I was being interviewed. This was because I had built a relationship on LinkedIn with the hiring manager. For several months, we had been discussing different job opportunities within the organization he worked for, and at the same time, he was getting to know more about my skills and career goals. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to build relationships to help your career move in the right direction. The saying <em class="italic">It isn't what you know, it's who you know</em> is partially true. If I were to reword the saying so it was completely true, I would say <em class="italic">Getting noticed for your skills by the right people is the key to success</em>. In this chapter, the following topics will be covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>LinkedIn the right way</li>
				<li>Building lasting connections, online and offline</li>
				<li>Quality over quantity</li>
				<li>Networking – conversation starters</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will start by discussing how to use <strong class="bold">LinkedIn</strong> to get noticed by recruiters and people hiring DevOps engineers, followed by how to build lasting relationships with the people who end up noticing you, both on LinkedIn and at meetups and other networking events. Afterward, I will explain why having a few connections with whom you are able to build relationships is better than having many connections. Finally, I will close this section by giving a few conversation starters for introverts, like myself, who are reading this book.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>LinkedIn the right way</h1>
			<p>LinkedIn started<a id="_idIndexMarker311"/> as a professional network; it has since expanded to be one of the leading job search sites. A few key statistics about LinkedIn to get you excited are shown in the following figure: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer073" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.01.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – LinkedIn infographic (2021)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – LinkedIn infographic (2021)</p>
			<p>Those are some large numbers. This section will guide you through how to correctly leverage them. The first step toward building a respectable reputation on LinkedIn is getting noticed. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Getting noticed</h2>
			<p>Getting noticed on LinkedIn<a id="_idIndexMarker312"/> can seem impossible, with the number of users approaching 1 billion. One of the easiest ways to get noticed is to change your security settings to be an open networker. After you have opened your profile up, it is time to start following and interacting with other DevOps professionals. If you lack DevOps connections, an effortless way to ensure you start seeing posts about #DevOps, #AWS, #DevOpsJobs, #CI, or anything else, is to follow specific hashtags. This will show not only your first-degree connections' posts but also second- and third-degree connections' posts. We will use the following diagram for the remainder of the section:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer074" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.02.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – LinkedIn connections &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – LinkedIn connections </p>
			<p>Pretend you have two friends, A and B; these are your first-degree connections or the ones you are directly<a id="_idIndexMarker313"/> connected with. In our example, each of your first-degree connections has two connections, and each of your second-degree connections has two connections.</p>
			<p>This translates to 14 connections in your extended network. These numbers increase exponentially as connections rise; with 50 first-degree connections, and each of your first-degree connections having 50 connections and each of your second-degree connections having 50 connections, the total connections in the first through third degrees amounts to an astounding 1,277,550.</p>
			<p>One way to get recognized by several connections is by posting about something you are learning about. Connections begin to comment on it and like it, and it ends up being seen by a recruiter who is looking for DevOps engineers with Kubernetes experience, as shown in the following diagram: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer075" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.03.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – A LinkedIn post leading to a third-degree private message&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – A LinkedIn post leading to a third-degree private message</p>
			<p>This may sound unlikely, but it happens to me time after time. After the recruiter has reached out to you via a private message, you can add them as a connection. This is a suitable time<a id="_idIndexMarker314"/> to bring up the previous lesson from <a href="B18117_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor122"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Rebranding Yourself</em>, on ensuring your LinkedIn profile is presentable; you do not want recruiters viewing your incomplete or messy profile. </p>
			<p>Another fantastic way to get recognized on LinkedIn is by commenting on and/or liking someone else's post. In the following example, <em class="italic">B1</em>, a second-degree connection, posts about starting a meetup in the area where you live. One of your connections has already liked the post. It shows up in your feed, so you like it, and comment on it as well. At this point, follow up with a personalized invite to connect, expressing your interest in the meetup: </p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Adding a second-degree connection to your network</p>
			<p>To recap this section, the best way<a id="_idIndexMarker315"/> to get noticed on LinkedIn is by interacting with connections, even if they are not directly connected to you. In the next section, we will discuss how to build lasting connections. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Building lasting connections, online and offline</h1>
			<p>You may get fortunate and be offered a job after one interaction with someone. This is not something that has happened to me; it has always been a long game when it comes to payoffs from relationships. There was an instance where a recruiter reached out to me<a id="_idIndexMarker316"/> about a job. At the time, I was not looking<a id="_idIndexMarker317"/> for a job change. We stayed connected on LinkedIn and met for lunch a few times a year. Three years later, a friend and former colleague lost his job after his department was restructured. I sent his resume over to the recruiter; within 2 weeks he was starting a well-paying contract gig that was able to hold him over while he searched for a more permanent position. </p>
			<p>In this section, we will discuss ways to build lasting connections, both in a virtual setting and in person. We will begin by discussing how to build connections online, or in a virtual setting.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Building connections in virtual settings </h2>
			<p>In DevOps circles, remote work<a id="_idIndexMarker318"/> and virtual relationship building<a id="_idIndexMarker319"/> are things that were happening long before Covid-19 turned our world upside down. Companies such as <strong class="bold">GitLab</strong>, <strong class="bold">Atlassian</strong>, and <strong class="bold">PagerDuty</strong> are remote-friendly, and team <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>members have amazing<a id="_idIndexMarker321"/> rapports with one another. I have been working<a id="_idIndexMarker322"/> remotely for 5 years, and believe the same practices used to ensure a strong bond among team members can be applied to any type of professional relationship. </p>
			<p>The following is the visual setup for the scenario of building relationships by being personal, helpful, and consistent:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer077" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.05.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – Setting up a scenario in LinkedIn&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – Setting up a scenario in LinkedIn</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Building connections in a personal setting</h2>
			<p>There is a line that you must<a id="_idIndexMarker323"/> not cross, obviously, but people<a id="_idIndexMarker324"/> love hearing about your pet and your activities outside of work. Take the preceding example. Let's assume Josh posted about completing a marathon. Rachelle likes it, and it shows up on your news feed. You enjoy running as well, so you decide to PM Josh: "<em class="italic">Congratulations on completing your marathon, what an accomplishment! I am a huge fan of running as well</em>." Messaging Josh has allowed you to connect on a personal, not work, level, which can help build stronger relationships.</p>
			<h3>Help your connections</h3>
			<p>Helping your connections<a id="_idIndexMarker325"/> is the most important tip on my list. After you sent Josh the PM, he looked at your profile and noticed you were both in DevOps, so he added you to his network. He ends up posting about having trouble with a side home automation project<a id="_idIndexMarker326"/> he is working on involving <strong class="bold">Raspberry Pi</strong>. You happen to have a similar setup, so you decide to share your GitHub link with the code you used in your setup. A few weeks later, you end up posting about an issue you are having with AWS, asking your network for help. Josh sees your post and comments on it, as well as PMing several solutions he has used in the past. His ideas end up being great; you ask if he would like to hop on a video call and explain a few more things in detail. </p>
			<h3>Consistently engage with your connections</h3>
			<p>At this point, you and Josh have a decent relationship. To keep it like this, you are going to need to stay<a id="_idIndexMarker327"/> engaged with him. Set some cadence where you check in with each other and see how things are going. </p>
			<p>In closing this section, I will leave you with several virtual meetups that can help you discover new professionals<a id="_idIndexMarker328"/> with the same interests as you; first, <strong class="bold">All Day DevOps</strong> (<strong class="bold">ADO</strong>) <a href="https://www.alldaydevops.com/">https://www.alldaydevops.com/</a>. If you search for online DevOps<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> conferences or virtual DevOps meetups, you will be amazed at how many there are. I encourage you to attend a few and figure out which ones will be of the most benefit to you.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>In real life </h2>
			<p>Covid-19 brought a new term into the workplace, <strong class="bold">in real life</strong> (<strong class="bold">IRL</strong>), and it is a clever way to describe<a id="_idIndexMarker330"/> meetups in person with colleagues <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>and coworkers, or potential colleagues and coworkers. Whether you are an introvert or extrovert, navigating IRL professional relationships is complicated, which is what we will address in this section. The biggest benefit from IRL events is the ability to get one-to-one time with people you want to connect with better. </p>
			<p>Next, we will discuss some attributes that are important in virtual relationships but are much more noticeable when dealing with IRL situations.</p>
			<h3>Authentically show others your true self</h3>
			<p>The best advice I was given by my mentor, which I would like to pass on to my readers, is to <em class="italic">be authentic</em>. My mentor<a id="_idIndexMarker332"/> was referring to the way I engage with people. Some people prefer a more intimate one-to-one conversation, while others feel more comfortable in a large group conversation. Put yourself in a situation where you can present yourself in an authentic manner. </p>
			<p>If you try to force yourself into a situation where you must act in a way that is not natural or comfortable for you, the conversation will not go smoothly. The individual you are trying to build a relationship with will realize you are not being yourself and will be wary of continuing to associate with you. </p>
			<h3>Engage actively with your network</h3>
			<p>If you have been focusing<a id="_idIndexMarker333"/> on learning a specific topic for an extended period, volunteer to be present at an upcoming event. This will have multiple benefits. First, it will ensure everyone who attends the meetup knows who you are, which is great if you are in the market for a career change. It also allows you to add <em class="italic">a presenter</em> to your LinkedIn profile, which is another terrific way to get noticed. Finally, if you are early in your career, it is a wonderful opportunity to get practice presenting, a skill that will be useful for the rest of your career. </p>
			<p>Another way to be engaged is to participate in back-and-forth discussions with the presenter directly after a presentation. Do not be argumentative. That will not build relationships; however, ask questions and sound interested. This will get you noticed. </p>
			<h3>Hold yourself to high professional standards</h3>
			<p>This one is common sense, but it is amazing<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> how many people forget this simple rule. After events, there is always a happy hour. It is easy to forget you are at an event to help build your career, and instead think you are out having fun with your friends. There are two simple rules to remember: keep the conversation professional, and do not overindulge in beverages. It is hard to come back from a poor first impression.</p>
			<p>In summary, to be successful at in-person events, bring your authentic self to the event, be engaged at the event, whether you are in the audience or are the presenter, and finally, be professional. </p>
			<p>It is important to end this section with a list of the six personal attributes that will make you more successful at building relationships, which are visually displayed in the following graphic:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer078" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.06.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – Attributes required for building relationships&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – Attributes required for building relationships</p>
			<p>Reiterating what is shown<a id="_idIndexMarker335"/> in the preceding graphic, you must try to be helpful, consistent, engaged, authentic, professional, and personal. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we will cover the importance of quality of connections over quantity of connections.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Quality over quantity</h1>
			<p>Two people make a post on LinkedIn<a id="_idIndexMarker336"/> at the same time regarding the same topic. Connection A has 10,000 connections, while connection B has 800 connections. After a day, connection A's post has two likes and no comments, while B's post has 14 likes and 22 comments. </p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>

					<img src="image/Figure_5.07.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – Looking toward quality&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – Looking toward quality</p>
			<p>When I first came across<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> a situation like this, I was confused; was connection A doing something wrong, or was connection B? Let me break it down.</p>
			<p>Connection A is focusing on growing their network, paying little attention to who is being added to their network. The number of connections is a vanity metric; it looks good at first glance but if you look deeper, it is meaningless. </p>
			<p>A more useful measure is how many times, and at what frequency, your connections interact with you. By this measure, connection B is definitely doing something right, but what?</p>
			<p>Well, if you have been reading this chapter, connection B has been doing all those things we have talked about. They have made a conscious effort to stay engaged with their connections, help others out, and get personal. Most important, connection B is always their authentic self, online and IRL. The following are questions you can ask to determine whether you should add a connection to your profile. If you answer yes to one or more, go ahead and add them; if not, do not add them. This is something that ensures each of your connections is someone you know, someone who interests you, or someone who can assist you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do I know this person?</li>
				<li>Do I feel drawn to this person's business, career path, or professional outlook?</li>
				<li>Do I have a direct need this person can fill?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The takeaway from this section is a culmination of behaviors that have been described throughout this chapter: it is better to have a few connections with who you have robust relationships rather than many connections who are nothing more than numbers. More simply, put <em class="italic">quality over quantity</em>. In the last section of this chapter, we will discuss<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> conversation starters you can use when at networking events.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Networking and conversation starters </h1>
			<p>There will be a few reading this book who, like me, really got the short straw when it came to being good<a id="_idIndexMarker339"/> at small talk. There will also be those who would prefer to skip the small talk<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> altogether and get to some deeper, more relevant discussions. In this section, you will learn a few useful techniques for facilitating a networking event, as well as conversation starters and redirects that can be used when you find yourself at a loss for words or feel it is time for another topic. Let's start with one that can be used to facilitate agenda-less meetings, <strong class="bold">Lean Coffee</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Lean Coffee </h2>
			<p>Lean Coffee<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> is a way to structure a meeting/event in a way that allows participants to vote on topics they would like to discuss. I have used this in book club discussions I have hosted as well to make a meeting with an over-stacked agenda much more productive. </p>
			<p>The following figure is a visual depiction of the essential items needed to facilitate a Lean Coffee meeting. It is also likely the artwork I am most proud of, as I am not an artist:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer080" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.08.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8 – Lean Coffee essentials&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – Lean Coffee essentials</p>
			<p>The minimum<a id="_idIndexMarker342"/> requirements to run a Lean Coffee event include sticky notes, markers, a smartphone or other timing device, a table, chairs, and most importantly, people. Next, we will talk about facilitating Lean Coffee. We will start with a visual depiction followed by detailed descriptions of each stage:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer081" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.09.jpg" alt="Figure 5.9 – Lean coffee &quot;how to&quot; visual&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9 – Lean coffee "how to" visual</p>
			<p>Now, let's talk about facilitating Lean Coffee.</p>
			<h3>Choose a theme </h3>
			<p>The theme can<a id="_idIndexMarker343"/> be anything, such as DevOps, security, or Agile in DevOps. They are all good themes for Lean Coffee. The purpose of them is to drive participants to add topics around a common theme.</p>
			<h3>Add topics </h3>
			<p>Participants add topics<a id="_idIndexMarker344"/> related to the theme they wish to discuss on sticky notes in as few words as possible. Topics, if the theme was DevOps, could include CICD tools, DevOps culture, and Docker. </p>
			<h3>Dot vote</h3>
			<p>Participants are given a set number<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> of votes to add to topics they would like to discuss. I have found simple Sharpie dots on the sticky notes work well. If you would like to be more formal, you can do it on a whiteboard.</p>
			<p>Drum roll, please. </p>
			<p>Topics are sorted in order of most votes to least votes. The topic with the most votes is discussed first.</p>
			<h3>Discuss</h3>
			<p>Start the timer for a given time – usually, 3–7 minutes is sufficient, and begin discussing<a id="_idIndexMarker346"/> the first topic. </p>
			<h3>Thumbs up/thumbs down </h3>
			<p>Sticking with the democratic<a id="_idIndexMarker347"/> nature of Lean Coffee, after the time runs out for a topic, additional time can be given if most people wish to continue the discussion; otherwise, move on to the next topic. </p>
			<p>You can be creative and apply the same concept to a virtual meeting using breakout rooms and the whiteboard functionality. At the end of the session, it is up to you and your group whether you decide to post notes on the Lean Coffee discussion. In the past, I have used GitHub pages to track outcomes of Lean Coffee, as well as upcoming dates.</p>
			<p>Next, I would like to discuss lightning talks, which work great as both virtual and IRL events. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Lightning talks</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Lightning talks</strong> are short presentations, usually 3–5 minutes in length, given in a forum where multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker348"/> presentations are given back to back. I absolutely love listening to lightning talks, especially in a venue where there are other individuals. Lightning talks introduce the audience to highly technical topics that leave the audience wanting more, which leads to some great post-presentation conversations between the audience and speakers.</p>
			<p>Every lightning talk session I have attended led to conversations about things I did not even know I was interested in, with people I would have otherwise never met. It is possible to start an internal, recurring lightning talk series in your DevOps or engineering group. When I worked at <em class="italic">Optum</em>, we incorporated a lightning talk at the beginning of our DevOps community office hours calls. It got attendees engaged from the start<a id="_idIndexMarker349"/> of the call, and also led to great discussions. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Conversation starters</h2>
			<p>You do not have quality<a id="_idIndexMarker350"/> connections because you aren't having conversations with people at networking events, and you aren't having conversations with people at networking events because you do not know what to talk about. We have all been there, or at least I have been there more times than I care to admit. In the previous sub-sections, we discussed lightning talks and Lean Coffee events that were purposefully designed to inspire conversations. Unfortunately, most networking events consist of refreshments and people gathered in a space. The following are a few things that have helped me as I matured in my ability to network effectively:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10 – Ways to improve your conversations</p>
			<p>We will first discuss the importance of being prepared.</p>
			<h3>Come prepared </h3>
			<p>If you are going to a Docker meetup, I would binge-watch a few videos on Docker, as well as reading some recent articles, to ensure you are able to have effective conversations with individuals who are at the event. </p>
			<h3>Get personal</h3>
			<p>Ask questions that<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> will give you more information to continue the conversation. An example of a poor initial question would be, <em class="italic">Hi, how are you doing?</em> This gives you no information to set up your next question and will lead to a short-lived conversation. A better conversation would be, <em class="italic">Hi, I see from your name tag you work at Amazon. What is it that you do there that has you interested in containers?</em> This is a good question. First, it cannot be answered with a single-word response; second, the response you get will help set up your next question; and finally, this question makes it seem as though you are terribly interested in getting to know them. Let's pretend the individual is the manager<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> of a team focused on AWS <strong class="bold">ECS (Elastic Container Storage)</strong>and is interested in Docker to ensure they stay at the bleeding edge of what is happening in the container space. The individual then turns the question on you, which brings me to the next point.</p>
			<h3>Be upfront with your intentions </h3>
			<p>If you are only at the event to network or connect with individuals who may help you land a job, state that. Being candid and forthcoming are traits many people admire, and few possess. The main point here is to be honest. </p>
			<h3>Know when and how to leave a conversation</h3>
			<p>If a conversation is going well, for instance, if after you stated your intentions, the individual seemed interested in learning more about you, you should spend as much time with the individuals as they need. Do not bow out of the conversation to move on to the next. You have laid the groundwork; now, it is time to build upon the foundation. The opposite of this is when the individual is not interested in networking for the sake of hiring someone now; thank the individual for their time, and leave by telling them to stay in touch via LinkedIn. Afterward, make sure to follow up and add them on LinkedIn with a message thanking them for the conversation; you never know when they<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> may be in the market for a candidate.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed several ways of networking, both virtually and IRL. We first discussed the best strategies for building relationships on LinkedIn. This included ways to increase the probability of you being noticed by others. In this section, you also learned ways to utilize your second- and third-degree connections to build relationships. The six traits that will improve the likelihood of successful conversations, virtually and IRL, were discussed. These consisted of being helpful, authentic, personal, consistent, engaged, and professional. We discovered that having connections that you interact with is more valuable than having many connections that you have no personal relationship with. Events that can help facilitate better conversation, such as lightning talks and Lean Coffee, were discussed next. Finally, we covered four methods that will drastically improve your ability to have meaningful conversations and build relationships at networking events. These consisted of coming prepared, showing you care, being upfront with your intentions, and knowing when to exit a conversation. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will cover mentorship: why it is important, and how to find a mentor.</p>
