     Why Do We Need to Understand Salesforce Anti-Patterns?

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">
     Salesforce anti-patterns tell us about the kinds of systematic mistakes that make their way into many Salesforce projects – mistakes that can even seem like a good idea at the time of implementation but end up having serious drawbacks in the long run.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">
     We’ll learn about the most common types of mistakes and how to think about them throughout this book.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">
     However, to do so, we must understand what anti-patterns are and how understanding them can help us architect and design

     In consequence, this chapter will start by explaining what anti-patterns are by going through several different definitions and ways of looking at them.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">
     Then, you’ll learn how they can help you deepen your understanding of architecture by knowing how these common mistakes are made and how they can seem like a good idea at the time.

     In addition to the traditional lessons learned from the Hero anti-pattern, it’s important to consider how this pattern intersects with modern trends such as AI and DevOps.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">
     For instance, in a DevOps environment, the reliance on a single “hero” to manage deployments can lead to significant bottlenecks and integration issues, highlighting the importance of practices such as continuous integration and

   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">
     Similarly, in AI projects, the Hero anti-pattern can manifest when a single data scientist or AI specialist is relied upon to deliver complex AI solutions without adequate support or knowledge transfer.
