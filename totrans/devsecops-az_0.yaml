    percent of organizations report that their DevOps initiatives face security challenges
    due to the increased speed, automation, and decentralization of the development

    gain a clear understanding of how to implement continuous security into every
    phase of the DevOps workflow for organizations that are adopting the Azure cloud,
    its services, and the</st> <st c="475">DevOps toolchain.</st>
