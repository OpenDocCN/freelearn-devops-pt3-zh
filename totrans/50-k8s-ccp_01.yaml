    sorts. You use it to run and deploy containers. However, that’s not the case.
    Kubernetes in itself is a platform. It’s almost like a subset of a methodology
    to run containers. Kubernetes, among many other platforms, is why the whole *platform
    engineer* title is becoming so popular. The DevOps space is moving away from thinking
    about just tools and focusing on the entire platform and environment.

    set of concepts in the 50 concepts will be explained here with the overall architecture
    of Kubernetes.

    heavily utilized on-premises. An example of this is certain regulatory requirements.
    I was recently chatting with a colleague that works in the defense space. Because
    of the obvious heavy security requirements that they have, along with the need
    to stay as close to certain areas as possible, using Kubernetes at the edge was
    a crucial part of success. Some of the edge Kubernetes nodes were running on k3s,
    which is a popular method of running Kubernetes for ARM devices. Those ARM devices
    are on-premises, so not in the cloud.

    so running Kubernetes in the cloud as a managed service is perfectly valid. It’s
    also an easier approach to hit the ground running with Kubernetes. For example,
    utilizing **Azure Kubernetes Service** (**AKS**) is a lot easier from the start
    than bootstrapping a five-node cluster with Kubeadm.

    Kubernetes, how to run it in the cloud, and the different popular cloud services
    that are available for you to use. Although not every single managed Kubernetes
    service is covered in these four chapters, these chapters will get you through
    the most popular along with giving you a solid idea of how the other services
    will look and be utilized.
