			<p><st c="2639">In the upcoming chapters of this book, we will discover how organizations can adapt their security practices, embrace automation, and nurture a culture of security awareness. </st><st c="2815">However, before we embark on that journey, let us take a moment to examine why traditional security falters and is limited in the fast-paced realm </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2962">of DevOps.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/><st c="2972">Understanding the limitations of traditional security in a fast-paced DevOps world</st></h2>
			<p><st c="3055">In the DevOps world, speed</st><a id="_idIndexMarker116"/><st c="3082"> is of the essence. </st><st c="3102">However, with this speed comes a potential downside: an increase in vulnerabilities that are created and that can slip through the cracks. </st><st c="3241">As organizations try to keep up with the demand for faster releases and quicker iterations, the risk of accidentally introducing vulnerabilities rises </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3392">in tandem.</st></span></p>
			<p class="author-quote"><st c="3402">As the software development and deployment speeds increase, so do the vulnerabilities that are created and that slip through the cracks.</st></p>
			<p><st c="3539">Traditional security struggles to keep up with this pace as it is often manual in its approach. </st><st c="3636">Manual security checks and reviews are time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable in a DevOps environment. </st><st c="3746">For example, consider a company such as WeChat that deploys about 1,000 times to production every day; very few organizations have the human resources to manually assess 1,000 releases on a daily basis! </st><st c="3949">Also, the rigid task of performing compliance checks often falls to the security team, which can sometimes make them less popular </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4079">with others.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="4091">Note</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="4096">Companies who have implemented cloud-native techniques have managed to achieve significant</st><a id="_idIndexMarker117"/><st c="4187"> speed, agility, and scalability, as mentioned </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4234">here: </st></span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition"><span class="No-Break"><st c="4240">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition</st></span></a><span class="No-Break"><st c="4317">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="4318">Also, traditional security approaches face limitations in supporting the modern technologies commonly used by organizations that follow a DevOps software delivery model. </st><st c="4489">In a DevOps world, more development teams are taking on operational responsibilities. </st><st c="4575">They are not only responsible for writing the code but also for deploying and managing the application. </st><st c="4679">To facilitate this shift, they adopt cloud-native technologies such as microservices architecture to develop and deploy independent services, they employ containerization for easy deployment and scalability, and they manage infrastructure using code. </st><st c="4930">However, traditional security approaches are not equipped to handle the unique challenges posed by these modern technologies. </st><st c="5056">Securing these technologies requires</st><a id="_idIndexMarker118"/><st c="5092"> a shift in the approach to security and the adoption of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5149">newer toolsets.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="5798">Another issue with traditional security processes in a DevOps world is that security-related activities are often relegated to the final stages of the development life cycle (</st><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="5974">Figure 2</st></em></span><em class="italic"><st c="5983">.1</st></em><st c="5985">). </st><st c="5989">It acts like a gatekeeper that stands at the end, evaluating the software for security vulnerabilities before it can be released or after it has been released. </st><st c="6149">This approach treats security as a separate and detached phase, rather than an integral part of the development process, such as functionality </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6292">or performance.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="6507">The consequence of this gatekeeping mentality is that when it comes time to deploy the software into production, security suddenly becomes a hurdle. </st><st c="6657">A senior developer once shared with me their experience, saying, “</st><em class="italic"><st c="6723">Everything we do moves quickly and smoothly until we try to deploy into production, and that’s when security gets involved!</st></em><st c="6847">” This statement perfectly</st><a id="_idIndexMarker122"/><st c="6874"> encapsulates the frustration that can arise when traditional security introduces friction in the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6972">DevOps process.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="7041">Adopting DevOps practices</st><a id="_idIndexMarker123"/><st c="7067"> introduces new tools within organizations (we discussed some of these tools in the first chapter of this book). </st><st c="7180">When utilized well, these tools can greatly enhance developer productivity. </st><st c="7256">However, they also present their own set of challenges. </st><st c="7312">They can lead to an expanded attack surface and create opportunities for potential attackers if not properly governed. </st><st c="7431">There are risks associated with inadequate access controls, insecure tool configurations, vulnerabilities</st><a id="_idIndexMarker124"/><st c="7536"> within the tools themselves, credential management, and insufficient monitoring </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7617">and logging.</st></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><st c="7719">It has access to an organization’s source code, one of its most </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7784">prized assets</st></span></li>

				<li><st c="7919">It has access to service credentials during the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7968">build process</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="7981">Such extensive access can pose serious risks if not properly secured. </st><st c="8052">If an attacker is able to exploit a single weakness, they can gain access to the software supply chain, inject malware to impact a greater number of victims, and access </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8221">sensitive data.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8236">These types of attacks (targeting DevOps tooling) are increasing in frequency, and we expect to see an even greater increase in the upcoming years. </st><st c="8385">A 2021 Forrester study found that 57% of organizations have suffered from a security incident related to exposure in the DevOps toolchain. </st><st c="8524">This signifies that these tools have become prime targets of attacks since they are at the core of critical development processes for </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8658">most organizations.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="8677">Forrester Report</st></p>

			<p><st c="10181">As previously discussed, isolating</st><a id="_idIndexMarker128"/><st c="10216"> security as a distinct phase within the software development life cycle is not conducive to the principles of DevOps, which emphasize speed </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10357">and agility.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="10717">Embedding security into every workflow means incorporating security practices and considerations right from the beginning, rather than treating it as a separate task. </st><st c="10885">This approach is referred to as </st><strong class="bold"><st c="10917">DevSecOps</st></strong><st c="10926">.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/><st c="11722">Understanding the cultural aspect of DevSecOps</st></h2>
			<p><st c="11769">Sadly, most discussions on DevSecOps </st><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/><st c="11807">are focused mainly on the integration of tools, and perhaps a few processes. </st><st c="11884">We think this could be a contributing factor as to why some organizations are not seeing better outcomes from their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12000">DevSecOps initiatives.</st></span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold"><st c="12022">DevSecOps at its core represents a cultural shift</st></strong><st c="12072">. In most organizations, there is a clear separation between development, operations, and security teams. </st><st c="12178">The development team is responsible for writing code and building applications, the operations team takes care of application deployment and configuration, and the security team ensures protection for applications </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12392">in production.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="12406">The culture of DevSecOps aims to remove the silos between these traditionally independent roles. </st><st c="12504">The aim is to get people to work better together and make the whole process of creating software more secure. </st><st c="12614">In this model, all teams are equally responsible for helping the business achieve its goal of consistently delivering secure and functional software to end users on a continuous basis. </st><st c="12799">Each team contributes its unique expertise in a collaborative effort to achieve this objective, moving away from a culture characterized by persistent blame </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12956">and avoidance.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="12970">Culture shift</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="12984">This is a significant change in the attitudes, behaviors, values, or norms of an organization over time. </st><st c="13090">It often involves a change of leadership styles, operational practices, or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13165">company values.</st></span></p>
