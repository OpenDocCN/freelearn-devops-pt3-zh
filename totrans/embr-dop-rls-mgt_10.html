<h1 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">What Does Receiving Support from Leadership and Stakeholders Look Like?</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Establishing a robust DevOps culture necessitates the unwavering backing and active involvement of the leadership within the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">If these individuals do not wholeheartedly support and commit to the DevOps initiative, there’s a significant chance that it will fail. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">Undoubtedly, the formation of a culture centered around collaboration and communication is contingent upon effective leadership. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">Leaders play a pivotal role in fostering an environment where barriers are eliminated and cross-team collaboration is actively encouraged. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.5">The leaders of the organization are required to fulfill the role of DevOps evangelists, actively advocating for the principles and advantages of DevOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.6">They must effectively communicate the rationale behind the implementation of DevOps release management and the potential benefits it holds for all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">stakeholders involved.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Simultaneously, leadership needs to exercise caution when attempting to implement DevOps solely based on theoretical knowledge acquired from literature. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">DevOps is a dynamic and iterative process that undergoes continuous growth and evolution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">For leadership to develop the appropriate culture, they must hold cognizance of the extensive nurturing and perseverance that is required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Neither the DevOps methodology nor any one DevOps team is identical to any other; rather, it is an organization-specific, solution-driven methodology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">Leaders should pave the way for autonomous teams to thrive by providing them with the tools they need to succeed and by recognizing when to back off and letting them execute their work as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">respected professionals.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">In this chapter, you will learn about the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">following topics:</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Making investments in people and technology that are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">deftly aligned</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Why empowerment, ethics, trust, and patience are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">highly valued</span></span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Making investments in people and technology that are deftly aligned</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">It </span><a id="_idIndexMarker703"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">is critical for all business units, including the boardroom and the CEO, to have a strong strategic alignment when it comes to investments in technology, personnel, and decision-making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Achieving a successful DevOps transformation requires that you establish </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">key performance indicators</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">KPIs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">) to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker704"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1"> adequately measure success and foster a more open and honest company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Using data to objectively back up your decisions is the best way to promote a company culture where empowerment, ethics, trust, and patience are all highly valued. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">As a leader in your organization, you must offer your team autonomy, ownership, and shared responsibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">In addition, you must understand the significance of putting the client first in all of your solutions-oriented initiatives and actively seek out ways to incorporate customer feedback into each decision. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.5">All aspects of the organization’s culture, leadership, and procedures should adhere to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">these principles.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">When embarking on a DevOps transformation, changes should be pushed from the top, and they should begin at the bottom. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">Without support from the top down, cultural change is impossible to achieve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">However, until change is carried out at the smallest possible denominator, it does not propagate across an entire enterprise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">Through the implementation of DevOps at the team level, teams can demonstrate what is possible, identify impediments, and overcome them while the problems are still modest and can be managed in a prefatory state. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.5">Instead of a single massive implementation, effective transformations are more often characterized by a journey of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">ongoing progress.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">In any DevOps transformation, it is the DevOps team that lays the groundwork for everything else to follow while the organizational leadership acts as their tailwinds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Every group’s potential to develop and release outstanding software is directly proportional to how well they work together as a team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">All team members must arrive prepared to work together and communicate well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.4">To this end, it is paramount that all individuals involved, including developers, testers, operations professionals, and security specialists, embrace a mindset that prioritizes collaboration to achieve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">shared objectives.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">While </span><a id="_idIndexMarker705"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">cutting-edge technology is certainly not the only factor that is necessary for effective teamwork and a flourishing DevOps transformation, it is a necessary one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">For example, DevOps release managers need tools such as Atlassian Jira to enable end-to-end issue tracking or tools such as SigNoz for comprehensive application monitoring. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">To ensure that a CI/CD operation is successful, all team members must have access to resources that maximize their contributions to the delivery process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.4">Concurrently, teammates require resources such as Slack to enable intuitive communication with one another, synergizing their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">work environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">An important factor to consider when putting together tools and technologies is to guarantee that the implemented systems provide a significant level of automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">In the absence of comprehensive automation, team members are required to carry out a multitude of manual and repetitive processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">This can impede the efficiency of operations, introduce mistakes, and result in discrepancies among deployment environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">A notable example is the security tool called Snyk. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.5">It conducts automatic vulnerability tests on various aspects such as your code, open </span><a id="_idIndexMarker706"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">source dependencies, container images, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Infrastructure as Code</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">IaC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">) configurations, and cloud environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Snyk</span><a id="_idIndexMarker707"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1"> also provides valuable context, prioritization, and remediation options. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Automation facilitates the standardization of operations and enables team members to allocate their efforts toward improvement and innovation, resulting in enhanced software quality, expedited delivery, and elevated levels of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">career fulfillment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">A leading indicator of success is the ability of business executives at all levels to fully understand the importance of technology and the people who are leveraging it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">The wisest CEOs know that the choices they make about investing in people and technology have a significant impact on the prosperity of their customers and their business models, both existing now and in the future. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">This isn’t an easy feat, considering how often new technology stacks and tools hit the market and how that change can impact the members of your team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">Simply put, the most successful executives offer a fully holistic </span><a id="_idIndexMarker708"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">business perspective across people, processes, information, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">and technology.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Now that we’ve discussed the importance of aligning your organization effectively, let’s turn our attention to the profoundly important duty of empowering </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">your team.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Why empowerment, ethics, trust, and patience are  highly valued</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">A strong culture is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker709"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">promoted by leadership in every successful firm that prioritizes DevOps release management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">These cultures revolve around values such as accountability, continuous learning, teamwork, and experimentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">The culture exerts a powerful influence and typically determines which personnel are hired and which teams they get placed on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">There is a prevailing cultural trend in the DevOps world that promotes the idea of achieving significant organizational influence through meaningful work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.5">In these cases, failure is not regarded as a loss, but rather as a progression toward discovering the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">correct solution.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Notably, the DevOps culture is characterized by a significant presence of patience, trust, ethics, and empowerment, while simultaneously having limited tolerance for waste, inefficient decision-making, and bureaucracy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">A fundamental virtue that all leaders must invoke is the cultivation of receptiveness and admiration toward novel ideas, regardless of their seemingly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">unconventional nature.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Communication in a DevOps environment</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">The key to successful communication in a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker710"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1"> DevOps environment is mutual respect and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker711"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> trust among team members across all</span><a id="_idIndexMarker712"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> levels. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">This necessitates honoring both complementary and contrasting personality traits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">Everyone deserves to be trusted and respected, regardless of their cultural background, personal experiences, learning style, problem-solving abilities, education, or employment history. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">Your fellow teammates will gradually gain trust in one another as they work together, in a mutually supportive and encouraging atmosphere, though it will take </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">some time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Auspiciously, team members have the opportunity to develop respect and confidence in one another through education and training initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">They can learn to listen to one another with greater consideration and to overcome interpersonal disputes by practicing mindfulness, for instance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">To be sure, employees need to feel respected and valued by leadership in their workplace. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">Staff members are less inclined to treat one another with dignity if they see that their supervisors do not reciprocate. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.5">No team can thrive in an atmosphere that constantly places blame or fails to acknowledge team members’ contributions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.6">There has to be an ethos of mutual respect and trust embedded into the institutional fabric at all levels of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">an organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">As part of the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker713"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">DevOps engineering culture, teams must take control</span><a id="_idIndexMarker714"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> of tasks that were previously handled by </span><a id="_idIndexMarker715"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">other departments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Having the authority to put changes into production requires engineering teams to ensure that testing, risk management, and escalation methods are in place by implementing controls into their processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">From the very beginning, control must be a part of the process and leadership must support it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.4">Automation is a huge boon, but the digitization of mundane, time-consuming activities is just one part of the puzzle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.5">The goal is to rethink the implementation of controls in such a way that they occur naturally within the process, unprompted by outside forces, thus eliminating bottlenecks, bureaucracy, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">ivory towers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Companies have long relied on audit-based control frameworks to build trust, with the goals of enhancing quality, assurance, security, compliance, and risk reduction through the use of checklists and audits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">The DevOps release management methodology is different; automation plays a crucial role in DevOps cultures by facilitating the adoption, acceptance, and integration of automated processes in both business and technical domains. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">Within these firms, automation is not perceived as a risk, but rather as a strategic optimization approach that offers opportunities for advancement and professional growth. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.4">Leadership can trust product teams to be mindful of organization-wide concepts and standards through the use of automated control functions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.5">Earning trust takes time, but it typically happens swiftly when teams work together and show success with modest</span><a id="_idIndexMarker716"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1"> pilots before expanding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">With this level of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker717"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">confidence, product teams will be able to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker718"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> make the right changes for the company without jeopardizing its security or the ability to get along with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">one another.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Understanding why building trust is the key to your success</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Modifying the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker719"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">culture of a business is a difficult task, which may explain why it is more convenient to prioritize automation and monitoring activities initially. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">One of the most insurmountable challenges of implementing DevOps is altering company culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">You must collaborate with individuals who might require adjustments to deeply ingrained habits that have been developed over extended periods, maybe spanning several decades. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.4">Perhaps it is those practices that got them to where they are now and have earned them respect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.5">It will require a considerable amount of time to establish a new organizational culture centered around autonomy and empowerment by altering habits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.6">Truly, it’s highly unlikely that you will be able to predict the exact duration or completion date </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">in advance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Fortunately, most individuals in a professional setting prefer to operate independently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">They appreciate the ability to make independent choices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">They have a strong desire to enhance their skills and find meaning in their work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">So, the question is: How can we achieve that? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.5">What steps can you take to ensure that your company’s culture is in sync with the demands of contemporary businesses? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.6">Trust plays an essential part in facilitating your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">DevOps transformation.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Organizations that operate without trust end up wasting valuable resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Despite hiring intelligent individuals and offering competitive salaries, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Bold Ventures LLC</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1"> struggled to fully utilize its entire workforce. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Deployments were incredibly simple and quick in the previous examples since the team had completely automated their CI/CD pipeline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">Despite the significant gains in efficiency brought about by the high level of automation, the company culture had forbidden them from implementing any modifications to the production systems unless they went through a formal </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">approval process.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">According to the American Heritage Dictionary, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">feedback</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1"> can be described as “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">The return of a portion of the output of a process or system to the input, especially when used to maintain performance or to control a system or process.</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">” (The American Heritage Dictionary entry: feedback.) On the other hand, a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">loop</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1"> is described as “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">Something having a shape, order, or path of motion that is circular or curved over on itself.</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">” (The American Heritage Dictionary entry: loop.) Therefore, a feedback loop is defined as “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">The section of a control system that allows for feedback and self-correction and that adjusts its operation according to differences between the actual and the desired or optimal output.</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">” (The American Heritage Dictionary entry: feedback loop.) It is this definition that is derived from the combination of the two concepts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">Simply put, feedback loops are an introspective evaluation of the functioning of teams, systems, and users, measured by both qualitative and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">quantitative analysis.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">Industry insiders and IT gurus concur that </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">feedback loops</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1"> help maintain focus on priorities and project goals, ensuring that the development process remains on track and doesn’t lose sight of its objectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">Connecting the two DevOps business segments mentioned previously is the sole purpose of this framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.3">Implementing a process where changes in one unit trigger changes in another unit, which in turn triggers changes in the first unit, is essentially what this accomplishes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.4">Because of this, a business may quickly and accurately make the required adjustments in a data-driven manner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.5">When it comes to information technology, the utilization of a feedback loop to gather data and establish a continuous flow of information will yield meaningful growth on a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">massive scale.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">You can divide your </span><a id="_idIndexMarker734"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">customer feedback loop into four </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">distinct components:</span></span></p>
