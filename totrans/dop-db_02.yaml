  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hierarchical databases are a type of **database management system** (**DBMS**)
    that follows a hierarchical structure for organizing data. This structure is similar
    to a tree, with the root node at the top and child nodes branching out from it.
    Each child node can have multiple child nodes of its own, and so on, creating
    a hierarchical structure of data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this model, data is organized into records, which are stored in a hierarchy
    of parent-child relationships. Each record is linked to one or more child records,
    forming a tree-like structure. The parent record is called the **owner** record,
    and the child records are called **member** records. The owner record can have
    one or more member records, but each member record can only have one owner record.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the key features of hierarchical databases is the use of pointers or
    links to connect records. These links define parent-child relationships between
    records and allow for efficient retrieval of data. The use of pointers is also
    what makes hierarchical databases fast and efficient, as they can quickly navigate
    through the database to find the desired records.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    large amounts of data in mainframe computers. IBM’s **Information Management System**
    (**IMS**) is one of the most well-known hierarchical databases, and it is still
    used today in many large enterprises.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main advantages of hierarchical databases is their speed and efficiency.
    Because data is organized in a tree-like structure and linked using pointers,
    hierarchical databases can quickly retrieve data by following these links. This
    makes them ideal for applications that require fast access to large amounts of
    data, such as banking and finance systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another advantage of hierarchical databases is their simplicity. The hierarchical
    structure is easy to understand and implement, making it a popular choice for
    small-to-medium-sized applications. This simplicity also makes it easier to maintain
    and update the database, as changes can be made quickly and efficiently.

- en: Disadvantages of hierarchical databases
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One major disadvantage of hierarchical databases is their inflexibility. Because
    data is organized in a strict hierarchy, it can be difficult to add or modify
    data without disrupting the structure of the database. This can make it challenging
    to adapt to changing business needs or to integrate with other systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another disadvantage of hierarchical databases is their lack of support for
    complex relationships between data. For example, if you wanted to represent a
    many-to-many relationship between two sets of data, it would be difficult to do
    so using a hierarchical structure. This can limit the types of applications that
    can be built using hierarchical databases, especially those that require more
    complex data relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, hierarchical databases can also suffer from data redundancy issues.
    Since each record can only have one owner record, duplicate data may need to be
    stored in multiple locations in the database. This can cause data inconsistencies
    and increase the storage requirements of the database.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hierarchical databases are also limited in terms of their scalability. As the
    size of the database grows, the hierarchical structure can become more complex
    and difficult to manage. This can lead to performance issues and make it challenging
    to scale the database to meet the needs of larger applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite these limitations, hierarchical databases continue to be used in many
    industries today. They are particularly well suited for applications that require
    fast and efficient retrieval of data, such as banking and finance systems. They
    can also be useful for smaller applications where simplicity is a priority and
    the data relationships are relatively straightforward.

    in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships. They are known for their
    speed and efficiency, as well as their simplicity and ease of maintenance. However,
    they can be inflexible and limited in terms of their ability to represent complex
    data relationships. Despite these limitations, hierarchical databases continue
    to be used in many industries today, particularly in applications that require

    is organized into a series of interconnected nodes or records. These records are
    linked together through a series of relationships, which form a network of interconnected
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the network database model, each record or node in the network is called
    an entity, and each relationship between entities is called a set. A set can be
    thought of as a pointer or link that connects one entity to another. Sets can
    also have attributes, which are properties that describe the relationship between
    entities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    complex relationships between entities. For example, an entity in the network
    can have multiple parents or children, and relationships can be defined between
    entities that are not directly connected.

    structures, including linked lists, trees, and graphs. These data structures are
    used to represent the relationships between entities and to facilitate efficient
    queries of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Because it allows for complex relationships between entities, it can be used to
    model a wide variety of data structures and relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the network database model also has some limitations. One of the main
    challenges with this model is that it can be difficult to maintain consistency
    and integrity when there are multiple relationships between entities. For example,
    if a book entity is linked to multiple borrower entities, it can be difficult
    to ensure that the borrower records are updated correctly when the book is checked
    out or returned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another limitation of the network database model is that it can be less intuitive
    than other database models, such as the relational database model. Because the
    network model relies heavily on sets and relationships, it can be more difficult
    to understand and work with than a table-based model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite these limitations, the network database model still has some important
    use cases and advantages. One of the primary advantages of the network database
    model is its ability to handle complex data structures and relationships. This
    makes it particularly well suited for applications that require hierarchical or
    recursive data structures, such as product structures, **bills of materials**
    (**BOMs**), and organization charts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    volumes of data. Because the data is organized hierarchically, it can be efficiently
    accessed and queried even when dealing with large datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, the network database model can be more performant than other database
    models in certain situations. For example, when dealing with complex relationships
    between entities, the network model can be faster than the relational model, which
    requires multiple joins to retrieve the same data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    by the relational database model, which has become the dominant database model
    in use today. This is largely due to the fact that the relational model is more
    intuitive and easier to use than the network model, particularly for non-technical
    users.

- en: The OO database model is a type of DBMS that uses an OOP language to create,
    store, and retrieve data. It is based on the principles of OOP, which means it
    treats data as objects. In this model, data is represented as objects that have
    attributes and methods, just as in OOP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the OO database model, data is stored in an OO database, which is a collection
    of objects that are organized into classes. A class is a blueprint for creating
    objects that have the same attributes and methods. Objects are instances of a
    class, and each object has its own unique set of values for its attributes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main advantages of the OO database model is that it allows for complex
    data structures to be created and stored in the database. This is because objects
    can be nested inside other objects, allowing for more complex relationships between
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another advantage of the OO database model is that it is highly flexible. Because
    data is stored as objects, it is easy to add new attributes and methods to objects
    as needed. This makes it easy to modify the database schema as requirements change,
    without having to make significant changes to the underlying database structure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the challenges of the OO database model is that it can be difficult to
    map it onto a traditional **relational DBMS** (**RDBMS**). This is because the
    OO model uses a different structure and different operations than a traditional
    RDBMS. Some OO databases have attempted to bridge this gap by providing a relational
    view of the OO data, but this can come at the cost of some of the flexibility
    and performance advantages of the OO model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address this challenge, some OO databases have been developed that are specifically
    designed to support the OO model. These databases typically provide a range of
    features that are not available in traditional RDBMSs, such as support for complex
    data structures, support for inheritance and polymorphism, and support for object
    versioning and transactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the key features of the OO database model is support for inheritance
    and polymorphism. Inheritance allows objects to inherit attributes and methods
    from their parent classes, making it easy to create new objects that are similar
    to existing ones. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their
    parent classes, which can simplify code and make it more flexible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important feature of the OO database model is support for transactions.
    Transactions allow multiple operations to be grouped together into a single unit
    of work, which ensures that either all of the operations are completed successfully
    or none of them are completed at all. This helps to ensure the integrity of the
    data in the database and can be particularly important in applications where data
    consistency is critical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OO databases can store a wide variety of data types, including text, images,
    audio, and video. This makes them well suited for applications that deal with
    multimedia data, such as video editing software or digital asset management systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One potential disadvantage of the OO database model is that it can be less efficient
    than a traditional RDBMS when it comes to queries that involve complex joins or
    aggregations. This is because the OO model is optimized for accessing individual
    objects, rather than for performing complex queries across multiple objects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address this challenge, some OO databases have included support for SQL,
    which allows developers to perform complex queries using a familiar syntax. However,
    this can come at the cost of some of the flexibility and performance advantages
    of the OO model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another potential disadvantage of the OO database model is that it can be more
    difficult to learn and use than a traditional RDBMS. This is because it requires
    developers to learn a new programming paradigm and to become familiar with the
    specific features and syntax of the OO database system they are using.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overall, the OO database model is a powerful and flexible approach to database
    management that is well suited for applications that deal with complex data structures
    and multimedia data. While it can be more challenging to learn and use than a
    traditional RDBMS, it offers significant advantages in terms of flexibility, performance,
    and data integrity. As such, it is an important option for developers and organizations
    that need to manage complex data in a flexible and efficient way.
