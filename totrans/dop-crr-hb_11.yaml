    remuneration, and set up an interview. This can be a daunting process, so we are
    going to spend the next several pages breaking it down, talking about all the
    steps involved, the best preparation practices, and other tricks of the trade.
    In the following chapter, we will go into more depth and even talk about non-typical

    Obviously, this can vary from place to place, but I find it to be the most common
    starting point. In our field, you can expect a technical screening round, which
    can be conducted by an individual or by a panel. For lead or management jobs,
    this can be conducted by your peers or maybe even by the people that report to
    you. Depending on the company, this can lead to another individual call with someone
    from your future leadership, which could mean your future boss or even their boss!
    Things they look for here are culture fit, the ability to communicate, and general
    compatibility. We will go into detail later. In some places, they may have more
    rounds. I have seen design-focused interviews, coding challenges, situational
    questions, behavioral, and even out-of-the-box thinking. I will cover this in
    [*Chapter 9*](B18117_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205), *Interviews Step by Step*.

- en: I also want to mention the fact that some technical jobs have programming tests,
    which could be offline or live, with someone watching you code and asking you
    questions. Some companies may also ask you to undertake behavioral or cognitive
    tests. I will cover these things in the non-typical interview walk-through. Coding
    tests might be common for software engineers, but much less so for DevOps professionals.
    I think three rounds is probably the most common setup. If you are being interviewed
    at larger companies, such as Fortune 100 companies, the process may entail four
    or five rounds.

- en: While you may speak with a recruiter and a person from human resources first,
    we consider the first-round interview to be with someone from your team. Typically,
    this is the hiring manager. This interview can last from 30 minutes to an hour,
    and it usually involves the hiring manager telling you about the company, the
    team, what they need, and then asking you for your experience. Make sure you have
    done your homework and you know something about the company.

    looking for and how your experience matches their search. When talking about your
    job experience, you should highlight your skills and anything you think is relevant
    to the position you are applying for.
  prefs: []

- en: One question they will certainly have for you, especially if you are not fresh
    out of college, is why you are looking to work at their company, or why you are
    looking to make a change. Usually, you can say you are looking for better pay,
    but that will not convince your future employer that you will not leave them for
    better remuneration elsewhere in the future. It is better to tie your desire for
    a new role to your career development and to the company you are applying for
    directly. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to show enthusiasm and interest
    in working with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Something I have noticed that hiring managers do at this stage is trying to
    determine how you would fit into the team. For example, if you are a manager,
    they will ask you about your leadership style. They may also ask you situational
    questions, such as *you telling them about a time* when you dealt with a particular
    issue. They may also ask you how you see yourself in terms of strengths, weaknesses,
    and career prospects, such as where you see yourself in 5 years.

    dealt with common scenarios. For example, tell me about a time when you disagreed
    with a stakeholder and how you went about resolving this. People want to know
    you can handle disagreement and friction, and are resilient enough to survive
    the modern workplace, so have a few stories to hand that showcase how you dealt
    with, and overcame, adversity and similar situations. Keep a spreadsheet or document
    handy and practice, and this will become second nature.

    you can contribute to making their efforts better.

    be a coding test, where someone gives you a problem and watches you solve it,
    possibly providing you with prompts followed by a period where you are required
    to work on the solution. During this time, they may ask questions regarding your
    work. It could be a panel interview, where three peers or experts ask you technical
    questions to see how deep your understanding extends across multiple domains.
    This is the most important round because you will be hired primarily for what
    you know, not for what you have done, and this is your opportunity to show it.
    Do not be afraid to ask questions if you need to, or to say *I don't know* when
    you are not sure. This is better than rambling, where you can end up digging a
    hole for yourself. You can always say *this is not my area of expertise* and prompt
    the interviewer to ask you a different question. Nobody knows everything, and
    so it is extremely easy to be stumped by someone who is trying to stump you. What
    you want to show are thoughtful answers and that you think about solutions in
    an intelligent and creative way.

    and it is designed to be that way. Use this to your benefit, stay calm, and allow
    yourself to process what is being asked of you. Ask for another question if you
    are not familiar with the concept or language of the one given to you.

    will be a difficult technical assessment that challenges your knowledge of computer
    science, including data structures, critical thinking, objects, and Big O notation.
    For cloud-related jobs, you may be asked specific questions on cloud services
    akin to those asked in certification exams. It pays to ask the recruiter what
    type of interview you will be facing next and whether there is any preparation
    advice. When there is a coding challenge, typically they employ a platform that
    allows you to use multiple programming languages, so you can generally use the
    one you are most familiar with. I always use Python, on account of how simple
    it is to use, but if you are more comfortable with Java, go for it. The key is
    to be proficient with at least one programming language. For these types of interviews,
    it is best to get plenty of practice, as stated previously. The following URL,
    [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/), and *Cracking the Coding Interview*
    (a book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell) are great resources.

    set aside a day when you can focus on this.

    For example, there could be a dedicated architecture or design interview where
    an expert in that area poses a scenario and wants to see how you approach the
    problem. If you are in leadership, it could be meeting a fellow leader from another
    team, or even your boss' boss. Interviewing with other teams is not uncommon,
    especially when there is clear overlap, such as with QA, testing, and DevOps.
    If you are an individual contributor, you can meet a fellow engineer, a more senior
    engineer, or an engineer from another team that collaborates closely with yours.
    DevOps is very collaborative, so you will meet people outside your own team, and
    it is important to show that you are customer service-oriented and a team player.

    part of their org. This will not be a technical interview, but a combination of
    a culture fit, leadership style, and aspirational qualities check. If you are
    a leader, be prepared to speak about your leadership style in depth, with concrete
    examples. If you are an individual contributor, you may be asked a growth-related
    question, where you are expected to share career plans so they can see how your
    plans align with their needs. It is common to be asked where you see yourself
    in 5 years, so having a rough outline in mind is advantageous.

    a lot of information regarding what their ideal candidate looks like. If you lack
    a skill that is highlighted there, you could try beefing up your knowledge in
    that area. If there is something required in which you are an expert, make sure
    you highlight this.

    many options to take quick courses in a few days leading up to the interview.
    This will help you thrive in the technical aspects as well. Sites such as Udemy,
    Pluralsight, and even YouTube have many tutorials on technical subject matter.
    Another aspect, if it applies to your interview, is coding challenges. Coding
    challenges can be very intimidating, due to being watched by the interviewer while
    trying to write code. A way to practice for this is to use websites such as *LeetCode*.
    These websites also offer optimal solutions to coding challenges as well. A good
    idea is to do these often, even when you are not interviewing, in order to become
    comfortable in these types of case scenarios.

    answers will make sure not only that your answer is strong and convincing, but
    that your delivery is crisp and enticing. You don't want to clear the technical

    may get an automated message thanking you but they are moving forward with other
    candidates. Do not be discouraged. I estimate it takes at least 50 applications
    to get an offer for a job you may really want, taking 5-10 interviews. Very few
    people apply for one role and get an interview and an offer. There is a lot of
    competition for high-paying technical jobs, so be patient and try to stack the
    deck in your favor as much as you can.

- en: Often, those that are getting interviewed panic when they are asked a question
    and they do not know the answer or are completely unfamiliar with the subject
    matter. In the technical world, new technologies are being implemented daily,
    so you will not know everything. This is NORMAL. It is almost always better to
    just state "I am not familiar with this, but it sounds really interesting to learn
    about," rather than try to make something up. Remember, the interviewer is probably
    an expert with that technology, and they will know immediately if you are bluffing.

    as well as any facts you may need at a moment's notice. It's also useful to keep
    track of where you are in the interview process, as well as what level of remuneration
    was discussed in an earlier conversation.

    answers to a question. The most common place this occurs is with remuneration.
    The recruiter will almost certainly ask you at your initial interview what you
    are expecting in terms of remuneration and it is important you remember this number
    and don't inflate it later in the process.

    prioritize continuous learning and self-improvement. Believe me, I am not the
    only person in a position to hire individuals who have the same outlook. In some
    cases, someone with a fresh outlook without prior knowledge is what a team needs.
