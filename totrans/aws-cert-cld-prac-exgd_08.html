			<p>Networking is a fundamental component of any IT infrastructure, whether on-premises on in the cloud. Without networking, it would not have been possible to architect the complex world of communications that we live in today. In the absence of networking, there would be no internet in the modern world.</p>
			<p>Almost every business today needs to have some form of network connectivity if it is to collaborate with partners and end customers. In this chapter, we look at some of the core building blocks of designing a network. We will also look at network services offered on AWS and, specifically, how <strong class="bold">Virtual Private Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPC</strong>) enables customers to build multiple isolated and secure networks within their AWS accounts, allowing them to isolate workloads and applications.</p>
			<p>We examine AWS Route53, which is Amazon's <strong class="bold">Domain Name System</strong> (<strong class="bold">DNS</strong>) that enables the routing of network traffic across the AWS ecosystem and the wider internet. Finally, we look at Amazon CloudFront, which is a <strong class="bold">Content Delivery Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDN</strong>), designed to help customers distribute their content to their customers much more effectively and with low latency.</p>
			<p>The following are the key topics we discuss in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction to on-premises networks</li>
				<li>Fundamentals of IP addressing, port numbers, subnet masks, and CIDRs</li>
				<li>Introduction to Amazon <strong class="bold">VPC</strong></li>
				<li>Basics of DNS and global routing with Amazon Route53</li>
				<li>Implementation of a robust CDN with Amazon CloudFront</li>
				<li>Introduction to API Gateway</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To complete this chapter, you will need access to your AWS account. You will be creating a simple VPC in your AWS account for which you will need to be logged into your AWS account using the IAM user account <strong class="source-inline">Alice</strong> that we created in <a href="B17124_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor068"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Identity and Access Management</em>. Remember, to log in using an IAM user account, you will need to provide your AWS account ID or account alias.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Introduction to on-premises networks</h1>
			<p>Almost every business will have some form of an on-premises network. Even if you are a self-employed "one-man band," you are likely to have a home office that also boasts a private network <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>environment. Your home office may look something like the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer103" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_01.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Home network components&#13;&#10;" width="894" height="291"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Home network components</p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, the devices on the home network communicate with each other over the Wi-Fi connection. If you send a print request from the computer desktop to the printer, then your document will get printed. This communication is made possible via the connectivity established over the Wi-Fi network. For devices to communicate with each other, they each require a unique IP address. If the IP addressing element is correctly defined, each device on the network will be able to see the other. The Wi-Fi service also connects the devices to the internet via a router/modem device that has established a connection with an internet service provider. This connection is usually via some form of physical cabling or cellular network connectivity through your telecom provider.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Basic corporate networks</h2>
			<p>Companies will <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>also have their own corporate networks, and you have probably worked in an office setting that has an IT network infrastructure in place. Corporate networks require more careful planning since many of them will also allow access to applications from outside the network. For example, your business may be publishing a website from within the corporate network to showcase its products and services to potential customers on the internet. The use of firewall routers that allow only specific types of traffic to enter the network from the internet and be directed to the appropriate server is all part of the secure planning for connectivity with the outside world.</p>
			<p>A corporate network would usually be divided into multiple smaller networks—each being used for a specific purpose. At its very basic level, a corporate network would consist of two <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>subnetworks: one for internal backend purposes and another to place services that are accessible from the internet.</p>
			<p>In the following diagram, a corporate network has been divided into two separate networks: one called the internal network, and another called the <strong class="bold">demilitarized zone</strong> (<strong class="bold">DMZ</strong>). The DMZ is an area where services are deployed that can be exposed on <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>the internet, for example, a web server. Traffic to services deployed in this zone is restricted with strict inbound rules to ensure high levels of security. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer104" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_02.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – Basic office network&#13;&#10;" width="1331" height="613"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – Basic office network</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding diagram, the corporate network is divided into three separate subnetworks. This ensures that we can configure rules that define the type of traffic that can enter each subnetwork and from which source. For example, we could configure inbound rules from the internet to grant access to our web servers over HTTP/HTTPS traffic. This will allow members of the public to access our corporate website and <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>review our service offerings. On the other hand, we would not expect to allow direct inbound traffic from the internet into the <strong class="bold">End User Computing </strong>(<strong class="bold">EUC</strong>) <strong class="bold">Virtual LAN</strong> (<strong class="bold">VLAN</strong>), as there is no requirement for such <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>inbound connection, and it ensures our corporate network is secure. Traffic from the workstations to the internet would, however, be permitted to allow members of staff to access online services and tools.</p>
			<p>Similarly, when building solutions on AWS, we need to configure virtual networks in the cloud that would <a id="_idIndexMarker492"/>allow us to host our applications in a manner that offers security, isolation, and inbound access only where it is needed. However, before examining the details of how we build cloud networks, it is important to understand how devices on a network communicate with each other and how we create networks and subnetworks.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we review some fundamentals of IP addressing, which will enable us to understand how we build such networks.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Fundamentals of IP addressing and CIDRs</h1>
			<p>For devices on your network to communicate with each other, an <strong class="bold">Internet Protocol address</strong> (<strong class="bold">IP address</strong>) is required. Each network device, whether it is a computer, laptop, mobile phone, printer, or network router, will need to be assigned an IP address that is routable in each network.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, each <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>device's IP address <a id="_idIndexMarker494"/>must be unique – you cannot have more than one device with the same IP address. This is just how telephones <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>work. Each telephone has a unique number assigned to it. To call someone on the phone, you need to first know their telephone number and then, dial that number, which results in your call getting connected. In <em class="italic">Figure 6.1</em>, you would have noticed that each of the internal devices in the home network had an IP address. </p>
			<p>There are two types of IP address: IPv4 and IPv6. We will discuss the key differences between them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>IP address version 4 – IPv4</h2>
			<p>IPv4 was the first version of the IP addressing system that was widely deployed and that ultimately formed the backbone of the internet.</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>standard IPv4 address format that you are familiar with and as depicted in the previous diagrams follows the structure of four decimal numbers separated by dots. An example of this is <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong>. Each decimal <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>notation in an IP address is called an <strong class="bold">octet</strong> and can be any number between <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">255</strong>, base <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> (decimal). As you are probably aware, computers <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>use binary numbers rather than decimal numbers. Each decimal number, when converted into binary, comprises 8 bits, ones and zeros. In both cases, whether decimal or binary, an IPv4 address is 32 bits in length.</p>
			<p>Let's take an example of an IP address of <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong>. In binary, each octet would be between 8 zeros and 8 ones (<strong class="source-inline">00000000</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">11111111</strong>). The individual decimal numbers in the IP address can be converted to its equivalent binary representation, which would comprise a combination of ones and zeros in each 8-bit octet. In the following diagram, the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong> in decimal is the same as <strong class="source-inline">11000000.10101000.00000001.00000110</strong> in binary:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer105" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_03.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – IP address to binary conversion&#13;&#10;" width="654" height="205"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – IP address to binary conversion</p>
			<p>While understanding how this conversion takes place is not a requirement to pass the Cloud Practitioner exam, I wanted to give you a quick overview here to further help you build your networking knowledge.</p>
			<p>Conversion of decimal notation into binary requires remembering the place value of the individual bits in each 8-bit octet. You can also calculate the place values if you do not want to simply remember them by heart.  </p>
			<p>Let's take the example of the last octet in the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong>, which in this case is the decimal number 6.</p>
			<p>In binary, you have 8 bits of zeros and ones to represent this decimal number. In the following table, we can see each of those bits and their place values:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer106" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_04.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4 – IP address place values&#13;&#10;" width="751" height="166"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – IP address place values</p>
			<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>each octet, starting <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>from right to left, the following applies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first value of the first bit is always equal to <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. It is <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> to the power of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> (<em class="italic">2^0</em>), that is, <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>.</li>
				<li>The second bit is double the first bit and equals <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> (<em class="italic">2 to the power of 1</em> – that is, <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>).</li>
				<li>The third bit is double the second bit and equals <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> (<em class="italic">2 to the power of 2</em> – that is, <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>).</li>
				<li>The fourth bit is double the third bit and equals <strong class="source-inline">8</strong> (<em class="italic">2 to the power of 3</em> – that is, <strong class="source-inline">8</strong>) and so on.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Calculating the decimal value of a binary representation is done as follows:</p>
			<p>Decimal = <em class="italic">(X*128) + (X*64) + (X*32) + (X*16) + (X*8) + (X*4) + (X*2) + (X*1)</em></p>
			<p>Next, to convert the decimal number <em class="italic">6</em> from the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong> into binary requires identifying which of the "Xs" should be converted to zeros and which to ones. You <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>want to convert the minimum number of bits to ones to get your decimal representation, and furthermore, you should continue to convert only those bits to ones whose value is less than your <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>decimal number. So, for example, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.5, we have the following</em>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You would not convert the bit on the far left to a <em class="italic">1</em> because 128 is greater than the last octet, <em class="italic">6</em> in our IP address. Similarly, you would not convert the next bit from the far left to a <em class="italic">1</em> in binary because 64 is also greater than the last octet, and so on.</li>
				<li>You would convert the third bit from the far right to a <em class="italic">1</em> because its placeholder value is equal to <em class="italic">4</em>, which is less than <em class="italic">6</em> in our IP address.</li>
				<li>You would also convert the second bit from the far right to a <em class="italic">1</em> because its placeholder value is equal to <em class="italic">2</em>, which is also less than <em class="italic">6</em> in our IP address.</li>
				<li>Remember that you want to convert the fewest bits to ones to get your decimal representation. So, in this case, <em class="italic">4</em> plus <em class="italic">2</em> equals the last octet, <em class="italic">6</em> in our IP address. As such, we should not convert the last bit to a <em class="italic">1</em> as the total would then add up to <em class="italic">7</em>, which is more than <em class="italic">6</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer107" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – Converting an IP address to its equivalent binary representation</p>
			<p>Hence, the <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>binary representation <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>of <em class="italic">6</em> is <strong class="source-inline">00000110</strong>. Similarly, converting the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong> to binary would give you <strong class="source-inline">11000000.10101000.00000001.00000110</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Limitations of IPv4 addresses</h2>
			<p>One of the primary limitations of an IPv4 address is that it is only 32 bits in length. This means that <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>the maximum number of addresses <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>you can have in an IPv4 addressing scheme is <em class="italic">2^32</em>, which is 4,294,967,294 addresses in total. Four-billion-odd addresses might seem like a large number, but the fact is that we have exhausted this range simply because of the vast number of devices that now need an IP address to participate on any given network.</p>
			<p>Currently, the largest network on the planet is the internet. Every device that needs to communicate on the internet also requires an IP address. Furthermore, every device on a given network must have a unique IP address. You cannot have two devices in the same network using the same IP address as this would result in a conflict. Given that the four-billion-odd addresses are not sufficient to handle the huge volumes of devices, the <strong class="bold">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</strong> (<strong class="bold">IANA</strong>) devised a brilliant plan to allocate a range <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>of IP address for private use only. These <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>address ranges are not routable on the internet, which means that businesses (and homes) can configure their internal private <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>networks using these addresses without any possibility of them conflicting with other businesses' networks, particularly if those businesses do not plan to connect their networks together.</p>
			<p>The following IP address ranges are designed for private use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0/8</strong> IP addresses: <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">172.16.0.0/12</strong> IP addresses: <strong class="source-inline">172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">192.168.0.0/16</strong> IP addresses: <strong class="source-inline">192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255</strong><p class="callout-heading">Additional Note</p><p class="callout">Another <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>range of private IP addresses is <strong class="source-inline">169.254.0.0</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">169.254.255.255</strong>, but those addresses are for <strong class="bold">Automatic Private IP Addressing</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIPA</strong>) use only, designed for internal Microsoft networks.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The remaining addresses are considered public, and thus are routable on the global internet. To illustrate how this helps, let's look at the next diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer108" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_06.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6 – Private IP address ranges used by businesses&#13;&#10;" width="610" height="276"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – Private IP address ranges used by businesses</p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, you will note that the three companies are able to use the same IP addresses for their internal devices. Since these businesses are not connected to each <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>other, there is no possibility of an IP address conflict. Private IP addresses such as <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>the ones designated by the IANA have helped businesses build internal networks without the need to procure any of the public addresses. The private IP address space also enhances internal network security because these addresses are not routable on the internet. We can also allow more devices to be networked, as the address ranges can be repeated among companies that do not need to be connected to each other over the same network. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Businesses need internet access</h2>
			<p>In the preceding illustration, we see that businesses can define internal network IP address <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>ranges that are not routable over the internet. These businesses will still require access to the internet, whether to send and receive emails from their customers or host e-commerce applications that their clients would need access to from the internet. To facilitate internet connectivity, public IP addresses are required. However, having to assign each device on the internet with a public IP address would defeat the purpose of private IP ranges and pose a security risk. Instead, the internal network can be configured to access the internet via a service called <strong class="bold">Network Address Translation</strong> (<strong class="bold">NAT</strong>).</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>following diagram, we can see that businesses are now able to access the internet via a NAT service configured on their external router. The NAT service requires a minimum of one single public IP address and relays <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>requests from the internal devices to the internet, acting as a proxy in between. Replies to those requests are also handled by the NAT service, ensuring that they are correctly redirected to the internal device that made the original request.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer109" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_07.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7 – Private IP address ranges used by businesses with internet via NAT services&#13;&#10;" width="847" height="326"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – Private IP address ranges used by businesses with internet via NAT services</p>
			<p>Given the <a id="_idIndexMarker516"/>limitation of IPv4, IPv6 was developed by the <strong class="bold">Internet Engineering Task Force</strong> (<strong class="bold">IETF</strong>) in the 1990s. We take a look at IPv6 next and discuss how it overcomes the 32-bit address limitation of IPv4.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>What about IPv6?</h2>
			<p>To address <a id="_idIndexMarker517"/>the limitations of IPv4, IPv6 was <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>developed by the IETF. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, which would give us <em class="italic">2^128</em> addresses. IPv6 is also denoted in hexadecimal format rather than the standard <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>decimal format. With IPv6, technically, each device could have its own public IP address. In fact, <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) offers IPv6 as an option to set up cloud networks. Even if you need to protect devices from the public internet, you can still use an IPv6 address for a virtual server in the cloud and allow it to send traffic over the internet using an egress-only internet gateway.  </p>
			<p>However, many <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>companies continue to use <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>IPv4, partly due to the capabilities of NAT services and partly to ensure interoperability with legacy devices that may not be IPv6-aware.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Network sizes and classes</h2>
			<p>Originally, the IETF designed different classes of IPv4 addresses to help define different network sizes and use cases.</p>
			<p>Classes A to C represent generic unicast IP addresses (with a few exceptions) that members <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>of the public can use to build networks of different sizes. Class D comprises multicast addresses, and class E has been reserved for experimental use.</p>
			<p>The way these classes help define network sizes is by splitting the IP address into a network portion and a host portion. Let's look at this individually by class:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Class A</strong> – The first 8 bits of a class A address define the network portion, and the remaining 24 bits are used to denote the host portion. Network bits are denoted by <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> (a one in binary) and host bits are denoted by <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> (zeroes). Also, the far-left bit of a class A address is set to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Class B</strong> – The first 16 bits of a class B address define the network portion, and the remaining 16 bits are used to denote the host portion. In a class B network, the two far-left bits are set to <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Class C</strong> – The first 24 bits of a class C address define the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are used to denote the host portion. Also, in a class C network, the two far-left bits are set to <strong class="source-inline">11</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To better illustrate how these three classes of networks actually look, let's look at the next diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer110" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_08.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8 – IP address classes&#13;&#10;" width="587" height="330"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8 – IP address classes</p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, you can identify which class a particular IP address belongs to and <a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>instantly identify the potential number of host IP addresses that IP block would have. So, for example, if we take the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong>, we can confirm that it is a class C address.</p>
			<p>What this means is that the network portion of the IP address is <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.x</strong>. In this example, x can be any number between 1 and 254. That gives you a total of 254 IP addresses in the host portion of the IP block. Although the total number of IP addresses you can have in any one octet is 256 (2^8, which equals 256), it is important to remember that the first and last IP addresses are unusable. The first IP address is always known as the network ID, which in this case is <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.</strong><strong class="bold">0</strong>. Here, the last octet would be represented by all zeroes (or, in binary, <strong class="source-inline">00000000</strong>). The last IP address is <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.</strong><strong class="bold">255</strong>, which is known as the broadcast address. Here, the last octet would be represented by all ones (or, in binary, <strong class="source-inline">11111111</strong>).</p>
			<p>A simple formula to work out the number of usable IP addresses in an IP block is as follows:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Number of Usable IP Addresses = 2^Number of Host Bits - 2</em></p>
			<p>In the preceding example, we have an IP address of <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong>, which belongs to an IP block that can only contain 254 usable IP addresses.</p>
			<p>So far, you have taken our word for it that the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong> belongs to a class C network <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/>and there are 254 IP addresses in the block of <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.x</strong>. Let's look at how this works next, when we discuss subnet masks.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>What are subnet masks?</h2>
			<p>Subnet masks allow you to split an IP address block into a network portion and a host portion. Host devices on the same network portion can easily talk to one another and will need <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>some form of routing to talk to hosts in other networks.</p>
			<p>In the preceding class C network, the first three octets belong to the network portion and only the last octet (last 8 bits) belongs to the host portion.</p>
			<p>A subnet is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all zeroes and setting network bits to all ones. A logical <strong class="source-inline">AND</strong> operation is then performed with a corresponding IP address block to define the number of host IP addresses that can be available in each block.</p>
			<p>So, for example, we can check that the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong> belongs to a class C address because a class C masks the first three octets (first 24 bits in binary) as the network portion and leaves the last octet (last 8 bits) for the host bits.</p>
			<p>In binary, the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong> and its associated subnet mask are represented as follows:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.9 – IP address and subnet mask conversion for 192.168.1.6</p>
			<p>A logical <strong class="source-inline">AND</strong> operation is calculated using the following process:</p>

				<li>A <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> equals <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>A <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> equals <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>A <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> equals <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>A <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> equals <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Based on the result of the preceding logical <strong class="source-inline">AND</strong> operation, you will note if any of the first three octets of the IP address were to change, for example, if instead of <strong class="source-inline">192</strong> we used <strong class="source-inline">193</strong>, then that would yield a different result for the corresponding logical <strong class="source-inline">AND</strong> operation block. Since the first three octets represent the network portion of an IP address, the resulting change would effectively denote a different network.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, because the host portion in the subnet mask is set to all zeroes and is only represented <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>by the last octet (last 8 bits), any variation in this octet will keep the IP address within the same network.</p>
			<p>For example, let's look at the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.12</strong>. Depicting this in the following diagram while performing a logical <strong class="source-inline">AND</strong> operation with the subnet mask would yield the following:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.10 – IP address and subnet mask conversion for 192.168.1.12</p>
			<p>What you will note from the preceding two diagrams is that the logical <strong class="source-inline">AND</strong> operation yields the same pattern of binary numbers, indicating the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Both IP addresses belong to the same network.</li>
				<li>The network portion in both cases is the same, derived by the subnet mask of <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong> (or <strong class="source-inline">11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000</strong>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>we know how subnet masks are used to <em class="italic">mask</em> portions of an IP address as a network portion and host portion, let's examine the concept of subnetting.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>What is subnetting?</h2>
			<p>In the preceding discussion on subnet masks, we defined three classes of networks. The networks are derived by using subnet masks with fixed lengths to create these classes. So, for example, in a class A network, the first octet of an IP block represents the network <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>portion and the remaining three octets the host portion.</p>
			<p>This is made possible by using what we call subnet masks. Specifically, we use a subnet mask of <strong class="source-inline">255.0.0.0</strong> to carve off the first octet for the network portion. Any change in the first octet of an IP address with a subnet mask of <strong class="source-inline">255.0.0.0</strong> would yield a different network. For example, <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0</strong> is on a different network to <strong class="source-inline">31.0.0.0</strong>.</p>
			<p>Subnetting is the process by which you can create subnetworks within a larger network. In each network, you may need to create smaller, isolated portions of the network, such as one portion for hosting all backend servers and another for hosting frontend web servers. Subnetting allows us to break up a large network into these smaller subnets.</p>
			<p>The process of creating subnets involves <em class="italic">borrowing</em> additional bits from the host portion of an IP address range. These borrowed bits are used to create smaller subnetworks within a larger primary network.</p>
			<p>For example, if we have a business requirement for eight subnetworks, each capable of hosting 30 IP addresses for 30 devices, then using a standard class C address, we could use the following IP blocks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Network 1 – <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.0</strong> (subnet mask: <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong>)</li>
				<li>Network 2 – <strong class="source-inline">192.168.2.0</strong> (subnet mask: <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong>)</li>
				<li>Network 3 – <strong class="source-inline">192.168.3.0</strong> (subnet mask: <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong>)</li>
				<li>Network 4 – <strong class="source-inline">192.168.4.0</strong> (subnet mask: <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong>)</li>
				<li>Network 5 – <strong class="source-inline">192.168.5.0</strong> (subnet mask: <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong>)</li>
				<li>Network 6 – <strong class="source-inline">192.168.6.0</strong> (subnet mask: <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong>)</li>
				<li>Network 7 – <strong class="source-inline">192.168.7.0</strong> (subnet mask: <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong>)</li>
				<li>Network 8 – <strong class="source-inline">192.168.8.0</strong> (subnet mask: <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While this network design works perfectly, we have a lot of wastage in terms of the number of IP addresses available versus the number of IP addresses required. Each of these eight networks contain 254 usable IP addresses, but we only need 30 addresses per network as per the requirement.</p>
			<p>When using <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>private IP ranges, this may not matter so much, but when we consider applying the same approach to the limited public IP address range, it becomes impossible to achieve. Also, note that you generally must pay for public IPs.</p>
			<p>Instead of this approach, we can use subnetting and subnet masks to break up a single network into smaller networks, conserving and efficiently using the available IP address space within a given network.</p>
			<p>So, for example, we can take the class C network of <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.0</strong> with a subnet mask of <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong> and break this up into smaller subnets. To do this, we borrow additional bits from the host portion of the IP address block to represent our subnets in the network.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at the next diagram to illustrate this concept:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer113" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_11.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11 – IP class C network&#13;&#10;" width="732" height="112"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11 – IP class C network</p>
			<p>In a standard class C network, the preceding IP address block of <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.0</strong> with a subnet mask of <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.0</strong> would yield a single network with 254 IP addresses.</p>
			<p>This is because we have used the first three octets (24 bits) to represent the network portion and the last octet (8 bits) to represent the host portion.</p>
			<p>Because we have 8 bits to represent host bits, we can use the formula 2^8, which equals 256. However, remember the first and last IP addresses are not usable, so that is 256-2, which gives us 254 usable IP addresses.</p>
			<p>Now if we <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>borrow the first 3 bits from the host portion of the IP address block to build subnetworks, we will have the following representation:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer114" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_12.jpg" alt="Figure 6.12 – Creating subnets by borrowing bits from the host portion of the IP address&#13;&#10;" width="737" height="113"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.12 – Creating subnets by borrowing bits from the host portion of the IP address</p>
			<p>By borrowing 3 bits from the far left of the fourth octet (the host portion), we can effectively create eight subnet networks. This is derived by the following formula: </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Number of subnets = 2^number of host bits borrowed</em></p>
			<p>In this case, <em class="italic">2^3 = 8</em> and so, this gives us 8 subnetworks. Furthermore, because we now only have 5 bits remaining to represent the host portion, we can work out the number of IP addresses we have per subnetwork. The formula is <em class="italic">Number of Hosts = 2^Number of Host Bits Remaining</em>. In this case, it is <em class="italic">2^5</em> (because there are 5 remaining host bits) = 32 IP addresses. In addition, as previously discussed, the first and the last IP addresses are not usable and as a result, we subtract 2 from the number of IP addresses (32-2), which gives us our 30 IP addresses, as required.</p>
			<p>If we look at the subnet mask representation of the borrowed 3 bits, we will have a new subnet mask as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer115" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_13.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13 – Creating subnets resulting in a new subnet mask&#13;&#10;" width="736" height="139"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.13 – Creating subnets resulting in a new subnet mask</p>
			<p>Using a <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>subnet mask of <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.224</strong>, we can see that we have eight individual subnetworks that can be created.</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.14 – Creation of eight subnetworks</p>
			<p>You will note the pattern difference in the IP blocks shown in binary. Specifically, the different combination of <em class="italic">ones</em> and <em class="italic">zeros</em> in the borrowed bits define the eight different networks. The following IP address blocks are the eight subnetworks that can be created by borrowing 3 bits from the host portion of the IP address block <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.0</strong>. Each subnetwork has 30 usable IP addresses. The eight networks are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.0 (192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.31)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.32 (192.168.1.32 to 192.168.1.63)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.64 (192.168.1.64 to 192.168.1.95)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.96 (192.168.1.96 to 192.168.1.127)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.128 (192.168.1.128 to 192.168.1.159)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.160 (192.168.1.160 to 192.168.1.191)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.192 (192.168.1.192 to 192.168.1.223)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.224 (192.168.1.224 to 192.168.1.255)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Using subnet <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>masking, you are then able to identify which network a particular IP address block belongs to. So, for example, the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.130</strong> would belong to the IP block <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.128</strong> with a subnet mask of <strong class="source-inline">255.255.255.224</strong>. This is made clearer when we look at the binary representation and perform the logical <strong class="source-inline">AND</strong> operation, as shown in the following diagram. You can see that the results of the logical <strong class="source-inline">AND</strong> operation match IP address block 5:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.15 – Illustrating how IP addresses fall in a given subnetwork range</p>
			<p>This binary <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>depiction and logical <strong class="source-inline">AND</strong> operation show how IP address block 5 falls in the same network as IP address block 1, as shown in the yellow cells. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)</h2>
			<p>Instead of using subnet masks and the complexity discussed previously, we can use CIDR. With <a id="_idIndexMarker534"/>CIDR, you can create networks of different sizes like how you use subnet masks. CIDR is essentially another way to represent subnet masks but offers more flexibility. The size of your network will determine how many IP addresses you can have in that network. You can also divide your network into multiple smaller networks (subnets) by configuring specific subsets of the IP block using CIDR blocks.</p>
			<p>When defining a network, CIDR blocks are displayed as part of the IP address block with a slash (/) followed by a decimal number between <strong class="source-inline">/8</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">/32</strong>. For example, the IP address <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.6</strong> could belong to a network <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.0/24</strong>. Let's look at how this works.</p>
			<p>In a network with a CIDR block of <strong class="source-inline">/24</strong>, we can work out the number of IP addresses that the network can host and therefore, the number of devices that can be placed in the network. Given that the total number of bits in an IPv4 range is 32, then for a <strong class="source-inline">/24</strong> CIDR, we simply subtract the 24 from 32, which gives us 8 bits. These 8 bits represent the total number of IP addresses we can have in that network. Specifically, <em class="italic">2^8</em> equals 256. So, the total number of IP addresses in network <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.0/24</strong> is 256 IP addresses. Remember, that on any given network, the first and last IP addresses are not usable. So, the total number of usable IP addresses is 256 - 2, which equals 254.</p>
			<p>An important point to note here is that the IP network with a CIDR block of <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.0/24</strong> is one single network and within this network, you can host up to 254 devices that would each need an IP address. The IP address range would be from <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.254</strong> (remember that the first IP <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.0</strong> and the last IP <strong class="source-inline">192.168.1.255</strong> are not usable).</p>
			<p>Let's look at <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>another example. We will use the IP range of <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">10.0.255.255</strong>, which is a private range for our internal network. Let's say that you choose a network IP with a CIDR block of <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0/16</strong>. In this network, your CIDR block is a <strong class="source-inline">/16</strong>. In this network, you can have a total of 65,536 IP addresses. Remember that to work out the number of IP addresses, you must subtract the value of 32 from the CIDR block notation, in this case, 16. This gives you 16 bits that can be used by devices in your network. Two to the power of <em class="italic">16 (2^16)</em> equals 65,536 IP addresses. Remember to subtract another 2 from the total number of IP addresses, which gives you a total number of 65,534 usable IP addresses. This is a very large network, and you may wish to divide this larger network into smaller subnetworks (subnets) for resource isolation and separation. Using the same network IP block, you can create subnetworks by increasing the CIDR block value. For example, in the primary network of <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0/16</strong>, you can create several subnetworks using the CIDR block of <strong class="source-inline">/20</strong>. This means that you have 12 bits remaining for the hosts portion of your IP address block (32 bits – 20 bits for the network). </p>
			<p>So, within the <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0/16</strong> network, you can have subnetworks with the IP block of <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0/20</strong>. Each subnetwork would have a total of 4,096 IP addresses (<em class="italic">2^12</em> hosts bits remaining) or 4,094 usable IP addresses (subtracting the 2 IPs that cannot be used).</p>
			<p>So far, we have looked at how IP addresses are configured and how they can be represented in both binary and decimal notation.</p>
			<p>We also looked at how you can create a large network and subsequently, multiple smaller networks using CIDR blocks.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we start to look at VPCs, which are virtual networks you can build on AWS similarly to how you would define networks on-premises. Many services require a VPC within <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>which you can launch resources. VPCs also help you protect your resources through firewall technologies, which we will also discuss in this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) </h1>
			<p>A VPC is a virtual network in the cloud. You choose the Region in which to create your VPC and define <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>its network parameters such as the IP address range and any subnetworks within it, for resource isolation.</p>
			<p>Resources deployed in your VPC can then access services on the internet or can grant inbound access from the internet, for example, if you are hosting an e-commerce web server.</p>
			<p>AWS already provides you with a default VPC in each Region. These default VPCs are designed to get you up and running with the ability to deploy EC2 instances so that they can access the internet and, where necessary, be configured to allow direct inbound access from the internet.</p>
			<p>You can also configure custom VPCs to suit your business requirements. When configuring a new VPC, you need to define an IP address block from one of the private IP ranges. Your VPC spans the entire Region in which you deploy it. This means that you can place workloads in different Availability Zones within the VPC to design for high availability.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>All about subnets</h2>
			<p>Depending on your requirements, you can configure your non-default VPCs with multiple subnetworks (subnets). </p>
			<p>A subnet is a <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>subset of the VPC, and this is defined in <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>the IP address block of the subnet. So, for example, if the IP address block of your VPC is <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0/16</strong>, public <strong class="source-inline">Subnet-1</strong> could be configured with a network IP address CIDR block of <strong class="source-inline">10.0.1.0/24</strong>. Each subnet you define in each VPC would also need to be configured with non-overlapping subsets of IP ranges from your primary VPC's IP address block. So, for example, if you build another subnet, say <strong class="source-inline">Subnet-2</strong>, you could use an IP address CIDR block of <strong class="source-inline">10.0.2.0/24</strong>.</p>
			<p>The IP address CIDR block of <strong class="source-inline">Subnet-1</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">10.0.1.0/24</strong>) and the IP address CIDR block of <strong class="source-inline">Subnet-2</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">10.0.2.0/24</strong>) as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.8</em> are not overlapping. Nevertheless, both <strong class="source-inline">Subnet-1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Subnet-2</strong> belong to the same VPC's IP address CIDR block of <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0/16</strong>. This is because the IP address CIDR blocks of both the subnets are direct subsets of the VPC's IP address CIDR block.</p>
			<p>Subnets are also restricted to a single Availability Zone. This means you can recreate multiple subnets across multiple Availability Zones, which would host replica resources to offer high <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>availability. If a single Availability Zone (and therefore, the subnet contained within) were to go offline, you can redirect traffic to a replica resource in the alternative <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>subnet that resides in another Availability Zone. The following diagram shows two subnets, one in each Availability Zone, that belong to the VPC. If <strong class="source-inline">Subnet-1</strong> were to go offline due to an Availability Zone outage, requests can still continue to be served by the database instance in <strong class="source-inline">Subnet-2.</strong></p>

				<div id="_idContainer118" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.16 – VPCs and subnets with non-overlapping IP addresses</p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, we have deployed two database instances across two subnets within two Availability Zones.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Internet access</h2>
			<p>By default, your custom VPCs need to be configured with internet access if you want the EC2 instances in the VPC to send traffic to the internet. Furthermore, if you deploy servers that <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>require direct inbound access from the internet, then you need to deploy them in subnets that have a direct route to the internet.</p>
			<p>As depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 6.9</em>, you can define which subnetworks have direct access to the public internet, called public subnets (for example, the DMZ) and which subnets are private, called private subnets (for backend operations).</p>
			<p>To configure <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>a VPC with internet access, you need to deploy an internet gateway. This is a free component that can be attached to your VPC to grant the VPC internet access. In addition, you would need to configure route tables associated with the public subnet to have direct access to the internet gateway. EC2 instances, which are then deployed in the public subnet, can send traffic to the internet and be configured to receive direct inbound traffic from the internet. An additional requirement, however, is that your EC2 instances in the public subnet must also have a public IP address. This can be dynamically assigned by AWS to the EC2 instances. Note that the public IP address is dynamic, which means that if the EC2 instance is stopped and then restarted, the IP address is likely to change. In most cases, this is acceptable because you generally will place your EC2 instances behind a load balancer (a service we discuss in a later chapter). However, if you need a static public IP address – one that does not change – then you can configure your EC2 instances with an elastic IP address.  </p>
			<p>Elastic IP addresses are static and remain in your account until you release them. They are ideally suited for those EC2 instances that must always have the same public IP address over time. Elastic IP addresses can also be reassigned from one EC2 instance to another. This can be helpful if, for example, an EC2 instance fails, and you need to spin up a new server as a replacement that must have the same IP address. Elastic IP addresses, therefore, can help you design for the high availability of services by automatically being reassigned to a standby EC2 instance in case of a failure on the primary EC2 instance.</p>
			<p>In terms of cost, it is important to remember that elastic IP addresses are free only while they are associated with an EC2 instance that is in the running state. If you have an EC2 instance in the stopped (shutdown) state, you will incur charges for that elastic IP address on an hourly basis. The following diagram illustrates how traffic from the internet can be routed to web servers deployed in public subnets of the VPC. Note that in this case, the web servers would also need public IP addresses.</p>

			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>preceding diagram, if Availability Zone 1A were to have a major outage, our <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>users can be redirected to the web servers in public <strong class="source-inline">Subnet-2</strong> of Availability Zone 1B and continue operations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>VPC security</h2>
			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker546"/>primary reasons for building a VPC on AWS is to implement firewall security to ensure that access to the resources deployed within the VPC is carefully managed. For example, some resources, such as web servers, would require inbound access from members of the public on the internet. By contrast, if an application running on those web servers needed to update a backend database (for example, confirmation of customer orders), then you would want to ensure that <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>only the web servers can make those updates to the backend database. You would not want members of the public to have direct access to the backend databases.</p>
			<p>Amazon offers two types of security service to enable you to build a highly secure environment, ensuring that only the required level of access and traffic is permitted.</p>
			<h3>Security groups</h3>
			<p>A security group is a firewall that is designed to allow you to configure what type of traffic <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>you permit, inbound and outbound, to your EC2 instances. When you launch an EC2 instance, you must assign <a id="_idIndexMarker549"/>at least one security group to it, which must contain the necessary rules for any inbound and outbound traffic you wish to allow. Note that you can associate up to five security groups with an instance. Security groups act at the instance level and not the subnet level. </p>
			<p>Each VPC comes with a default security group that allows all traffic inbound, <em class="italic">but only where the source of that traffic is the security group itself</em>. This means that if you have two EC2 instances associated with the same security group, then one EC2 instance will accept traffic initiated by the other EC2 instance. In addition, all outbound traffic to any destination is permitted. This means that an EC2 instance associated with the default security group can initiate communication outbound. This is based on the idea that you can trust your EC2 instances to make any necessary outbound requests, for example, to download operating system updates.</p>
			<p>However, security groups do not allow any traffic to inbound from other sources (other than itself) until you create necessary rules. This is to prevent any unsolicited traffic reaching your instance. So, if you are configuring a web server that needs to serve web pages on the standard HTTP protocol, then you would need to configure an appropriate inbound rule for HTTP and specify the source of the traffic in terms of an IP address range. In addition to the default security group, you can also create your own security groups.</p>
			<p>An important feature to consider about security groups is that even though you may not have configured any inbound rules, response traffic to any outbound requests will be permitted inbound by the security group. Conversely, if you configured any inbound rules, responses to any inbound traffic that are allowed in because of those rules are permitted <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>outbound regardless of any explicit outbound rules. This feature is what makes security groups <strong class="bold">stateful</strong>.</p>
			<p>Some <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>additional key features include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can configure <em class="italic">allow</em> rules, but you cannot configure explicit <em class="italic">deny</em> rules.</li>
				<li>You can specify separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic.</li>
				<li>You can filter traffic based on protocols and port numbers. You can also specify sources and destinations that can be other security groups, thus offering a layered security approach.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Security groups therefore protect your EC2 instances and enable you to define what inbound traffic you will allow to the instances.</p>
			<h3>Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)</h3>
			<p>NACLs are <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>another type of firewall service that are designed to protect entire subnets. Rather than offer protection at the instance level, they can be configured to allow or deny traffic from reaching subnets, within which you deploy your EC2 instances.</p>
			<p>A default <a id="_idIndexMarker553"/>NACL is configured in every VPC, which is configured to allow all inbound and outbound traffic. This is acceptable because traffic must still be permitted via security groups, which, by default, block all inbound connections.</p>
			<p>Incidentally, you can configure your subnets with custom NACLs, which, by default, block both inbound and outbound traffic, and additional configuration will be required to create any necessary inbound and outbound rules.</p>
			<p>NACLs are also stateless, meaning that you have to configure both the inbound rules and corresponding outbound rules for traffic to flow and be responded to.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>
			<p>At the start of this chapter, we discussed how a typical corporate network is usually divided <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/>into smaller subnetworks. Certain resources will be deployed in the DMZ (called public subnets on AWS) and others will be deployed in backend private subnets. By deploying resources in a private subnet, we ensured that there was no direct connection <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>to them from the public internet. Such resources include database servers or application servers that should be accessible only via frontend web services or load balancers. This ensures that any traffic to those backend services is proxied via those frontend web services and without exposing them on the public internet.</p>
			<p>Application servers may, however, require access to the internet, for example, to download product updates or patches. Since these servers will not have a public IP address and will be placed in private subnets, we need a mechanism for them to access the internet and to allow inbound responses to those servers. To fulfill this requirement, we can set up and configure a NAT service. As depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 6.10</em>, this NAT service needs to be placed in the public subnet of your VPC and have an elastic IP address attached to it. Your route table is then configured with a rule to allow internet-bound traffic from EC2 instances in the private subnets to access the internet via this NAT service. The NAT service relays requests from the EC2 instances in the private subnet to the internet, acting as a proxy.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, if you need to enable EC2 instances with private IPv4 address access to the internet without directly exposing them on the internet (for example, with a public IP address), then on AWS, you can configure a NAT gateway to relay internet requests on behalf of those devices.</p>
			<p>If you are using IPv6, as discussed earlier in this chapter, and you want to ensure that EC2 instances with IPv6 can access the internet without being directly exposed on the internet, you need <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>to route traffic from those instances via an <strong class="bold">egress-only internet gateway</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>VPC peering</h2>
			<p>A VPC peering <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>connection is a private network connection between two VPCs. The service allows you to connect multiple VPCs so that instances in one VPC can access resources in another VPC. This means that traffic between VPCs over a peering connection does not traverse the public internet and offers greater levels of bandwidth, as well as security. Furthermore, the connections between the peers are highly available and there is no single point of failure.</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>create VPC peering connections between VPCs in one AWS account or between AWS accounts. Peering connections can also be configured between VPCs in the same Region or across different Regions. This means that if you have VPCs across different Regions, for example, to facilitate the deployment of resources closer to your global branch offices, those resources can access each other across Regions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>VPC transit gateway</h2>
			<p>Earlier, we discussed how VPC peering can help you connect multiple VPCs together. The problem <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>with VPC peering, however, is that every VPC must establish a one-to-one connection with its peer. Once the connections have been established, you also need to configure your route tables in each of the peered VPCs to direct appropriate traffic across the peering connection. If you have multiple VPCs that need to connect to each other, it can become very difficult to manage the individual connections and numerous route table entries.</p>
			<p>In the following diagram, you will note the complexity of the various peering connections to connect each VPC:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer120" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_18.jpg" alt="Figure 6.18 – Multiple VPC peering connections&#13;&#10;" width="580" height="348"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.18 – Multiple VPC peering connections</p>
			<p>With AWS <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>Transit Gateway, you can connect your individual VPCs together via the gateway in a hub-and-spoke model. This greatly simplifies your network architecture, as each new VPC that is peered to the gateway needs just a single connection to be able to route traffic to the other VPCs, as long as necessary route table configurations permit it to do so.</p>
			<p>This simplified model is depicted in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer121" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_19.jpg" alt="Figure 6.19 – AWS Transit Gateway&#13;&#10;" width="583" height="352"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.19 – AWS Transit Gateway</p>
			<p>Transit gateways <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>help to reduce the architectural design overhead when trying to connect many VPCs together. Transit gateways achieve this design by using a hub-and-spoke architectural model.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</h2>
			<p>Your VPC is hosted on the AWS platform. You can deploy various resources within your VPC, which <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>you can access via the public internet, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>configure an internet gateway and the necessary security groups and NACLs. However, you can also connect your VPC to your corporate network (on-premises or a co-location data center). This type of connection <a id="_idIndexMarker564"/>is known as VPN. A VPN is a secure encrypted site-to-site tunnel established between two endpoints over the public internet. It offers AES 128 or 256-bit <strong class="bold">Internet Protocol security (IPsec)</strong> encryption, which means that you can transfer data between the two endpoints securely.</p>
			<p>To set up a VPN connection between your on-premises network and the VPC, you need to create a <strong class="bold">Virtual Private Gateway</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPG</strong>) and attach it to your VPC. You will also need to <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>configure a customer gateway, which is a physical or virtual device located in the on-premises network that connects to the VPG over the internet. The setup is illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 6.12</em>.</p>
			<p>AWS supports a wide range of customer gateway devices, including Cisco, Juniper, and Check Point <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>devices. Once the VPN connection has been <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>established, you still need to configure your route tables on both the internal network and the VPC to direct appropriate traffic over the tunnel, as required.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer122" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_20.jpg" alt="Figure 6.20 – Amazon VPNs&#13;&#10;" width="853" height="394"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.20 – Amazon VPNs</p>
			<p>While VPN connections enable you to encrypt traffic between the local network and the VPC, as depicted by the diagram, the bandwidth is limited to what your internet service provider offers. Furthermore, on AWS, there is a hard limit of 1.26 Gbps. With a VPN connection you are also dependent on the routing mechanism of the public internet. If you require a more dedicated connection that bypasses the public internet altogether, then Amazon offers a service called Direct Connect, which we will look at next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Direct Connect</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Direct Connect</strong> is a service that enables you to connect your corporate data center to your VPC and the public services offered by AWS via a dedicated private connection that bypasses the internet altogether.</p>
			<p>This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>more expensive solution than standard VPN setups due to the requirement to lay down necessary fiber optic cabling between your corporate office (or data center) and a local Amazon Direct Connect partner. Nevertheless, the service can <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>offer dedicated links that operate at 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and up to 100 Gbps. Direct Connect thus gives you ultra-high-speed connectivity as well as a secure private connection.</p>
			<p>In this section, we examined the core features and components of Amazon VPCs. VPCs enable you to build secure, isolated network areas within the AWS cloud that can be configured to allow only authorized connections into them. VPCs offer two types of firewall solutions – security groups and NACLs. The former can be configured to allow only specific types of traffic and acts as a firewall at the instance level, whereas the latter protects the entire subnet. Security groups are stateful, whereas NACLs are stateless; however, NACLs also provide the ability to deny specific types of traffic from specific sources. For example, if you host a web server and want to allow public access to the server from the internet, but also want to block access from a certain IP range (perhaps because you have discovered a potential attack from that range), NACLs can help you configure necessary deny rules as well.</p>
			<p>You can use both NACLs and security groups to build a layered, secure architecture. NACLs will protect your entire subnets by letting you explicitly define the type of traffic that can enter the subnet. Next, you define security groups for different groups of EC2 instances that may reside in a subnet, ensuring that only the necessary traffic is permitted to connect to the application running on those EC2 instances.</p>
			<p>We then examined features such as VPC peering, AWS Transit Gateway, VPN connections, and the Direct Connect service. In the next section, we will learn about the AWS global DNS, Amazon Route53. AWS Route53 enables you to direct traffic to resources both in your VPC and on the public internet using DNS name resolution, but also helps you shape traffic for high availability and fault tolerance.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Learning about DNS and global routing with Amazon Route53</h1>
			<p>AWS Route53 is Amazon's global DNS, which is a service to help translate human-readable <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>names into an IP address because, ultimately, computers connect to each other over IP addresses. DNS servers across the internet <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>host billions of such name-to-IP address records, among other types of records. When you use your favorite browser to visit a <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>particular website, such as <strong class="source-inline">example.com</strong>, your browser sends a request to your local DNS service provider, which, if necessary, refers the <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>query to that domain's (<strong class="source-inline">example.com</strong>) authoritative DNS server. This authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address of the website you are trying to access, and your browser is then able to establish a connection with the website (in this case, <strong class="source-inline">example.com</strong>). This process of translating domain names to IP addresses is called name resolution.</p>
			<p>Amazon Route53 offers three primary functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Domain registration</li>
				<li>DNS routing</li>
				<li>Health checks</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at each of the functions next. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Domain registration</h2>
			<p>Before you can use a domain name for your website or web application that members of the <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>public can access, you need to register a name of your choice with a domain registrar. Amazon Route53 offers complete <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>domain name registration services. When you choose a <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>name to register, you do so under a <strong class="bold">Top-Level Domain</strong> (<strong class="bold">TLD</strong>) such as <strong class="source-inline">.com</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">.co.uk</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">.org,</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">.net</strong>. If the name of your choice under a particular TLD is not available, you can try a different TLD. For example, if <strong class="source-inline">example.com</strong> is not available because someone else has already registered it, then you can try <strong class="source-inline">example.co.uk</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">example.net</strong>. There are hundreds of TLD names to choose from.</p>
			<p>As part of the registration, you purchase a lease duration for your domain name, which can be from anywhere between 1 year and 10 years. You need to renew this lease before expiry, or you risk someone else registering the name, which will affect your ability to offer your web services using the same domain name.</p>
			<p>Once you have registered your domain name, you then need to host it with a DNS hosting service provider. Often, the registration and hosting service is offered by the same company, in this case, Amazon Route53. The hosting service offers you the ability to create resource records for your domain, for example, configuring the domain name to point <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>to an IP address of a web server. When users on the internet type the domain name in their browser, they are directed <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>to your web server, which hosts your website.</p>
			<p>There are several types of resource records you can create. Some types of resource records are displayed in the following table:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer123" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Table_6.1.jpg" alt="Table 6.1 – Example resource records for iaasacademy.com&#13;&#10;" width="1650" height="377"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Table 6.1 – Example resource records for iaasacademy.com</p>
			<p>When configuring your domain names, you also need to define a zone file, which will host <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>resource records for your domain name. It is in <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>a zone file that you would create resource records, such as the A record, which are standard name-to-IP address resolution records. Next, we look at how zone files are created on AWS Route53.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Hosted zones</h2>
			<p>To create the necessary resource records for your domain name, you need to set up a hosted <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>zone on Route53. A hosted zone is a container that is used to store and manage your resource records and allows you to define how <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>traffic is routed for your domain (<strong class="source-inline">example.com</strong>) and any sub-domains (such as <strong class="source-inline">portal.example.com</strong>).</p>
			<p>There are two types of hosted zones you can set up on Route53:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Public hosted zone</strong> – This is a container that allows you to define how you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>route traffic for your domain <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>name across the public internet. For example, when you host an S3 static website (as discussed in <a href="B17124_05_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor094"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</em>), you configure a website endpoint name such as <strong class="source-inline">http://bucket-name.s3-website-Region.amazonaws.com</strong>. You could provide this S3 website endpoint URL to your users to access your web pages that are hosted on the S3 bucket. However, a much better option would be to create an alias record that points your company domain name (<strong class="source-inline">example.com</strong>) to the S3 website endpoint. Your users would find it much easier to remember your domain name than the original S3 endpoint name.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Private hosted zone</strong> – This is a container that allows you to define how you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>route traffic for your domain <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>name across private networks, such as one or more of your VPCs. Route53 will route traffic for the domain name to resources configured in your VPCs based on the resource records you create. For example, you could use a friendly domain name such as <strong class="source-inline">devserver.example.com</strong> that points to an EC2 instance within your VPCs, which other resources in the VPC may need to connect to. This is a much better option <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>than having to remember IP addresses of your EC2 instances and means you do not need to hardcode those IP addresses in your application code, which can become difficult to manage.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>DNS hostnames</h3>
			<p>AWS provides a DNS server (Amazon Route53 Resolver) for your VPC. This enables AWS to <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>configure DNS hostnames for the instances you deploy <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>in your VPC. DNS hostnames comprise a hostname and a domain name, such as <strong class="source-inline">myserver.mycompany.com</strong>. DNS hostnames enable you to create unique names for your EC2 instances. In addition, AWS provides two types of DNS hostnames:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Private DNS hostnames</strong> – These resolve to the private IPv4 address of the instance. The <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>DNS hostname <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>can take one of the following two forms, depending on the Region:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">ip-private-ipv4-address.ec2.internal for the us-east-1 Region</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">ip-private-ipv4-address.region.compute.internal for other Region</strong></p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">private-ipv4-address</strong> is the reverse lookup IP address.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Public DNS hostnames</strong> – These resolve a public DNS hostname to the public IPv4 <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>address of the instance outside the network of the <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>instance, and to the private IPv4 address of the instance from within the network of the instance. The DNS hostname can take one of the following two forms, depending on the Region:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">ec2-public-ipv4-address.compute-1.amazonaws.com for the us-east-1</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">ec2-public-ipv4-address.region.compute.amazonaws.com for other Regions.</strong></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While Route53 <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>offers a fully functional DNS, it also enables <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>you to design how traffic is routed across resources placed within a Region and across Regions. Next, we look at the different routing policies offered by Amazon Route53.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Routing policies</h2>
			<p>In addition to standard name resolution services, such as pointing your domain name to a specific IP <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>address, Amazon Route53 also offers several complex routing policies and configurations. These routing policies enable you to define various rules that offer the ability to build highly available solutions or <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>redirect customers to resources that are closer to their location and thus reduce latency.</p>
			<p>Let's examine the various routing policies available with Amazon Route53:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Simple routing policy</strong>: The most basic and default routing policy. This resource <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>record enables you to map a domain name to a single resource, such as an IP address of a web server or a DNS endpoint of an elastic load balancer. The policy engine will not check whether the resource is functioning and available.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Failover routing policy</strong>: To offer high availability, you can host two copies of your <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>resources ideally across different Regions. One set of resources will be designated as your primary resource and the other as a secondary resource. Route53 performs health checks (discussed later) to determine whether the primary resource is available and in the event of a failure to connect to the primary resource, Route53 will redirect all traffic to the secondary resource. This failover routing policy enables you to design your solution with an active-passive failover.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Geolocation routing policy</strong>: This routing policy enables you to route traffic based on <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>the geographical location of your users – such as continent, country, or state (in the United States). Your users' location is determined from the source of the DNS queries for your web service. This routing policy is particularly useful when you need to ensure that your content is accessible only in locations where you have distribution rights. For example, if your end users are based in Europe, you may wish to direct them to a copy of your resources deployed in the Frankfurt Region.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Latency routing policy</strong>: This routing policy is particularly useful when you have <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>resources deployed in multiple Regions and you wish to route your users' traffic to the Region that offers the lowest latency.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Weighted routing policy</strong>: This routing policy enables you to route different ratios of <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>your total traffic to different resources associated with a single domain. For example, you can choose to route three-quarters of your traffic to one copy of your resource and the remaining one-quarter to another. This is also particularly useful when you want to perform a gradual migration of your total traffic from one resource to another, such as a new version of your website. You can gradually alter the weights to migrate your total traffic over a short period of time from the old version of your website to the new version.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>creating certain routing policies, such as the failover routing policy, you also need to define health checks so that Route53 can determine whether a failover to the secondary site is required. We look at health checks in detail next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Health checks</h2>
			<p>You can use Route53 to perform health checks against your resources, such as web servers, elastic <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>load balancers, and S3 static websites. Depending on the results of your checks, you can then take appropriate actions and redirect traffic as necessary to ensure the high availability of services. There are three types of <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>health checks you can perform:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Health checks that monitor an endpoint</strong>: This monitors an endpoint you specify, such as an IP address or domain name.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Health checks that monitor other health checks</strong>: You can choose to monitor multiple resources and determine the overall health of your collection of resources based on some minimum number of resources that are healthy. If the number of available resources drops below a specified threshold, Route53 health checks can then take appropriate action.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms</strong>: You can create CloudWatch alarms that monitor your resources' metrics, for example, the number of healthy EC2 instances behind an elastic load balancer. You can then configure Route53 to monitor the same data stream that CloudWatch monitors for the alarms and will mark the resource as unhealthy if the threshold values are crossed. Route53 does not wait for the CloudWatch alarm to go into the <strong class="source-inline">ALARM</strong> state either, as it independently determines the health based on the metric data.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to routing policies and health checks, you can also build complex routing rules, and for this, we look at traffic flow and traffic policies next. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Traffic flow and traffic policies</h2>
			<p>You may <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>need to create complex routing of traffic <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>using a combination of resource records and Route53 routing policies. For example, you may create configuration in <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>which you set up latency routing policies across several Regions, which then reference weighted records in each Region for your resources. Each configuration is known as a <strong class="bold">traffic policy</strong>, and you use a visual editor to help you build your routing architecture, which Route53 uses to design your traffic flow. Using the visual editor, you can also create multiple versions of your traffic policy so that you can quickly adapt to changes. Note that you can only use a traffic flow to create records in public hosted zones:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Geoproximity routing policy</strong>: In addition to the standard Route53 routing policies, you <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>can also configure geoproximity routing policies (available only when you use Route53 Traffic Flow). This routing policy enables you to route traffic based on the location of your resources. You can also shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another location using a <em class="italic">bias</em> value.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Route53 Resolver</strong>: Route53 also enables you to perform DNS resolution between <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>Route53 Resolver and DNS resolvers on your network by configuring forwarding rules. In this case, <em class="italic">your network</em> can comprise your VPC, other peered VPCs, or even your on-premises corporate data centers connected to AWS either via a VPN or AWS Direct Connect.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, we learned about the Amazon DNS service offered by Route53. Route53 enables you to register domain names, create public and private hosted zones to manage your resource records, define routing policies for different use cases, and perform health checks against your resources. Route53 also enables you to build complex routing rules using multiple resource records, along with traffic flow and traffic policies.</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>next section, we look at AWS CloudFront, which is Amazon's <strong class="bold">Content Delivery Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDN</strong>) solution. CDNs are often used to distribute content globally from a source location and, with the help of caching services, offer reliable, low-latency access to your content.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Implementing a robust CDN with Amazon CloudFront</h1>
			<p>Amazon CloudFront is a CDN that helps you to distribute your static and dynamic digital content <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>globally with low-latency <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>connections. AWS CloudFront uses AWS edge locations and regional edge caches to cache content closer to your end users' locations. This means that you can host your content in one specific Region and a user who attempts to access it from another Region will retrieve the content via the edge location over the AWS backbone network. Furthermore, as content is retrieved, it is cached at a local edge location closer to the user for a period (known as a <strong class="bold">time-to-live</strong> or <strong class="bold">TTL</strong>), further improving network latency in subsequent requests for the same content.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer124" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17124_06_21.jpg" alt="Figure 6.21 – A typical CloudFront distribution&#13;&#10;" width="875" height="518"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.21 – A typical CloudFront distribution</p>
			<p>To configure <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>Amazon CloudFront, you create a distribution endpoint that defines the types of content you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>serve and the source of that content. The source can be an S3 bucket, an S3 bucket configured as a static website, an Amazon EC2 instance, or an elastic load balancer, among others. As part of your configuration, you get a CloudFront URL, which you provide to your users to access your content via CloudFront. You can also use custom URLs, which allows you to define your distribution with a company-branded domain name.</p>
			<p>When you configure your CloudFront distributions, you can choose to serve your content over HTTP and HTTPS. Some examples of types of content that can be served include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Static and dynamic content, for example, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images</li>
				<li>Video on <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>demand in different formats, for example, Apple <strong class="bold">HTTP Live Streaming</strong> (<strong class="bold">HLS</strong>) and Microsoft Smooth Streaming</li>
				<li>Live events and conferences</li>
			</ul>
			<p>CloudFront <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>ultimately enables <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>you to architect a CDN for your web application. Next, we look at how CloudFront is priced.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Choosing a price class for your CloudFront distribution</h2>
			<p>Amazon charges you for distributing your content via its edge locations. Rather than charge you <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>on a per-edge location basis, however, Amazon have clubbed several edge locations across Regions into three specific price classes. The most expensive price class is where your content is accessible via all edge locations globally. This also happens to be the default price class when you create your distribution, but ultimately offers the best performance. If you are looking to reduce cost and if you know that the consumers of your content are from specific Regions, you can choose two alternative price classes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>United States; Canada; Europe; Hong Kong, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore; Japan; India; South Africa; and Middle East regions – This class excludes the most expensive regions.</li>
				<li>United States, Canada, and Europe regions – This class is the least expensive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, we examined the services offered by the AWS CloudFront service and how it can be used to distribute your content globally over AWS backbone networks, offering lower latency and better performance.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we provide a brief introduction to Amazon API Gateway, which allows you to architect serverless applications by creating, publishing, and managing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Introduction to Amazon API Gateway</h1>
			<p>Amazon API Gateway helps you design application solutions that favor the microservices architecture <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>in place of monolith designs. Your backend developers can build a series of microservices that work with each other. For example, in an e-commerce application, you can have several microservices, such as cart-service, catalog-service, user-profile and user-session services, inventory-management-service, and more.  </p>
			<p>Without an API gateway, your frontend developer (who builds the frontend user interface) would need to be made aware of all the backend APIs and build the application to call several microservices, to provide complete functionality. Imagine, then, your backend developer later needs to refactor one of the microservices, such as splitting one microservice into two separate microservices, each with its own API. This would result in having to recode some components of the frontend user interface too.  </p>
			<p>With an API gateway, you essentially create an abstraction layer. This API gateway can be used to expose all the APIs that need to be made available to external clients to call backend services. Requests from those clients can then be routed to the various backend microservices. As per the following diagram, Amazon API Gateway acts as a "front door" for your applications to access backend data, Lambda functions, databases, and more. It handles all the incoming traffic and is capable of processing thousands of concurrent API calls.</p>

			<p>Amazon API Gateway <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>offers features that also help you protect your backend services, such as authorization, access control, and monitoring, and <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>help protect backend resources from <strong class="bold">Distributed Denial of Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DDoS</strong>) attacks.</p>
			<p>In terms of designing your software architecture, adding this abstraction layer creates an additional hop for your clients to access backend resources. To improve application responsiveness, Amazon API Gateway offers features to optimize your APIs such as response caching and payload compression.</p>
			<p>In this section, we provided a brief introduction to Amazon API Gateway, which is a fully managed service that enables you to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you have the opportunity to build out your own Amazon VPC as part of the exercises in this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Exercise 6.1 – setting up a public subnet VPC</h1>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>exercise, you will create your own custom VPC that will contain a public subnet. In later chapters, you will expand this VPC to add private subnets for different use case:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Log in to your AWS account as the IAM user <strong class="source-inline">Alice</strong> you created in <a href="B17124_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor068"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Identity and Access Management</em>.</li>
				<li>On the main AWS Management Console, search for <strong class="source-inline">VPC</strong> in the search box.<div id="_idContainer126" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B17124_06_23.jpg" alt="Figure 6.23 – Configuring a new VPC&#13;&#10;" width="1258" height="491"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.23 – Configuring a new VPC</p></li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">VPC</strong> from the filtered list.</li>
				<li>VPCs are Reg<a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>ion-specific, so make sure you select the US-East-1 Region from the top right-hand corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>On the main VPC console screen, click on the <strong class="bold">Launch VPC Wizard</strong> button. This will launch the VPC wizard.</li>
				<li>Next, select the first option, <strong class="bold">VPC with a Single Public Subnet.</strong></li>
				<li>In <em class="italic">Step 2</em>, provide the following details for your VPC.<p>For <strong class="bold">IPv4 CIDR block</strong>, enter the IP block of <strong class="source-inline">10.0.0.0/16</strong>. This IP block represents your VPC network.</p><p>For <strong class="bold">VPC name</strong>, enter the name <strong class="source-inline">ProductionVPC</strong>.</p><p>The wizard gets you to create a single public subnet. Later, you will expand this VPC for future use, but for now, set the <strong class="bold">Public subnet's IPv4 CIDR</strong> field to <strong class="source-inline">10.0.1.0/24</strong>.</p><p>For <strong class="bold">Availability Zone</strong>, select <strong class="bold">us-east-1a</strong> from the drop-down list. Remember that while VPCs span the entire Region, each subnet you create spans a single Availability Zone. In this case, we are creating a single public subnet in <strong class="bold">us-east-1a.</strong></p><p>Next, rename <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>the subnet name to <strong class="bold">Public Subnet One</strong>.</p><p>Next, click the <strong class="bold">Create VPC</strong> button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Review the following screenshot for the preceding steps:</p><div id="_idContainer127" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B17124_06_24.jpg" alt="Figure 6.24 – VPC with public subnet configuration page&#13;&#10;" width="1131" height="651"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.24 – VPC with public subnet configuration page</p></li>
				<li>The wizard runs through the parameters you specified and creates your first VPC.</li>
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">OK</strong> on the <strong class="bold">VPC Successfully Created</strong> status page.</li>
				<li>In the list of VPCs, you will note that your newly created <strong class="bold">ProductionVPC</strong> has been successfully created:</li>

			<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>demonstrated how to create your first public subnet VPC using the AWS VPC wizard. Later in the training guide, you will expand the VPC to include private subnets and deploy servers within our VPCs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter examined Amazon's core network services, comprising VPCs, Amazon's DNS service offering with Route53, and Amazon's CDN solution with Amazon CloudFront.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned how computers communicate with each other via IP addresses. You also learned that using IP addressing and CIDR block ranges, you can build isolated networks and subnetworks. We then discussed how you can build the same network architecture in the cloud using the Amazon VPC service. As part of setting up your VPC, you examined the use cases to build private and public subnets and explored tools for defining security rules and limiting the types of traffic that can enter and leave your VPC. We also looked at additional VPC services that enable you to interconnect multiple VPCs using VPC peering and how to build complex connections more easily across VPCs using AWS Transit Gateway.</p>
			<p>Next, we learned about the AWS Route53 service, a DNS offering that provides domain name registration, a route policy configuration service, and health checks. You learned that by using a routing policy, you can customize your solutions for a wide range of use cases. These include offering an active-passive failover service with the Route53 latency routing policy, and the ability to slowly migrate your users from one resource to another using the weighted routing policy.</p>
			<p>Finally, you learned about Amazon CloudFront and how to use AWS's edge locations to distribute your digital assets and content globally from a single Region over a high-speed low-latency connection.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn about the <strong class="bold">Elastic Cloud Compute </strong>(<strong class="bold">EC2</strong>) service and how you can deploy compute services such as virtual servers running Linux or Windows operating systems in the cloud.</p>
