    We started with a benefit hypothesis to deliver value to our customers and turned
    it into features to develop in Continuous Exploration. In Continuous Integration,
    we developed our feature, story by story, and applied those changes into version
    control, which built and tested the change using the automation of the Continuous
    Delivery Pipeline until it was ready to go to the production environment. In Continuous
    Deployment, we propagated our changes to the production environment, keeping the
    change hidden from the general user population, until we were ready to release.

    On April 23, 1985, the Coca-Cola Company announced the first major change to the
    formula for its flagship soft drink. *New Coke* had succeeded in over 200,000
    blind taste tests against Pepsi, Coke’s chief competitor. However, upon release,
    the reaction was swift and negative. The outcry against the new formula had forced
    Coca-Cola to reintroduce the original formula as *Coca-Cola Classic* after only
    79 days. Since that time, companies have used progressive releases before releasing

    into the coal mine. The canary would act as a warning of the presence of toxic
    gases. Because of its small size, if it died in the coal mine, a toxic gas was
    present, and the miners should evacuate immediately.

    product or new features to a small select group of customers to get their feedback
    on a release before the entire user population.

    environments. If the production environments are in different geographic regions,
    the changes are released in one production environment to try on one set of users,
    while the other production environments remain on their versions. If all goes
    well, eventually the environments in the remaining regions are upgraded.

    and Finding New Features*, we viewed the application of Eric Ries’s Build-Measure-Learn
    cycle into the SAFe® Lean Startup cycle where we saw how Epics are created with
    a benefit hypothesis. The Epics are implemented with a **Minimum Viable Product**
    (**MVP**), which acts as an experiment to prove or disprove the benefit hypothesis.
    The MVP is evaluated through innovation accounting and tracking of leading indicators
    that will be used to determine the pivot or persevere decision.

    features created at the beginning of the Continuous Delivery Pipeline. We have
    developed these features, tested them, and deployed them into the production environment
    through the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment stages of our pipeline.
    Now, in Release on Demand, we show our MVP as features to the user population
    to see whether the benefit hypothesis is proven. Based on the innovation accounting
    metrics we are collecting through our full-stack telemetry, we come to the following
    two decisions:'

    We mentioned that in relentless improvement, we looked for opportunities to be
    better because of that “hidden sense of danger.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to improve the flow of value. The teams have been regularly holding retrospectives
    at the end of each iteration to identify problems at the team level and ART holds
    the **Inspect and Adapt** (**I&A**) event at the end of the Program Increment
    to look at systemic issues.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    mapping our value stream as it stands currently, but also identifying an ideal
    *future-state* value stream. Improvement actions could come from small, iterative
    changes toward that ideal value stream.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One other step for improvement is to hold a value stream mapping session at
    least once a year to evaluate the value stream in its current iteration. This
    allows the ART to view the present bottlenecks impeding the flow of value. During
    this value stream mapping session, a new future-state value stream can be identified
    for new improvements.

    want to set up our architecture to allow for each component to have different
    release cadences. After release, we want to ensure that the changes don’t disrupt
    the environment and that our overall solution is stable. To do that, we adhere
    to the principles and primary practices of SRE, including preparing for disaster
    recovery.'
