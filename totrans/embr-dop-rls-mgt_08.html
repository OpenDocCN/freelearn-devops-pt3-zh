<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">Give teams flexibility</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">No </span><a id="_idIndexMarker585"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">matter how many precautions you take, people will still create their own tools, scripts, and automations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">Implementing safeguards to avoid this, or making it such that people can build up their own tools and instances in a transparent and sanctioned fashion, is an important aspect of good CI/CD governance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.3">The most effective method for accomplishing this is to provide </span><a id="_idIndexMarker586"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">workers with the freedom they require to carry out their duties, as well as to conduct routine process reviews to identify areas in which either extra freedom or, on the flip side, increased formality is required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">Creative liberty is the best way to build a workforce that is invested in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">a company.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">Generously invest in your automated testing</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">An essential element of efficient CI/CD governance models includes incorporating suitable testing suites, in particular automated tests that assist teams in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">shifting left</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1"> or prioritizing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker587"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">security and functionality as early as possible in the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">software development life cycle</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">SDLC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">We strongly advise that, right from the start of the SDLC, rapid and cost-effective tests be given top priority. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.3">These </span><a id="_idIndexMarker588"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">kinds of tests must be finished within a very short amount of time – short enough that engineers are not incentivized to switch gears and multitask on another project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">If the test fails, the development team should be made fully aware of it immediately so that the issue can’t be ignored or overlooked by accident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.3">As your SDLC becomes more mature, your testing requirements should grow more specific. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.4">Traceability is another crucial factor to consider regarding automated testing practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.5">If you can identify the failure point, you will be in a much better position to quickly diagnose the issue and find </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">a solution.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">Standardize code reviews</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">The implementation of robust CI/CD governance necessitates the creation of a system wherein an individual is unable to arbitrarily author code, commence a build process, and deploy </span><a id="_idIndexMarker589"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">this code without undergoing extra validation measures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">This implies that each modification must have approval from a minimum of two individuals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.3">It is important to note that obtaining a second person’s approval for all modifications is not always necessary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.4">In certain cases, relying on an automated test can offer a satisfactory level of assurance to proceed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.5">Regardless of the strategy that’s chosen, it is imperative to establish and articulate rules at the organizational level to guarantee that teams adhere to a uniform set of practices and processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.6">The objective is to increase the success of developers in identifying and resolving code issues, mitigating the introduction of defects, and guaranteeing compliance with the core project specifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.7">As a result, this can enhance the overall productivity and efficiency of the development effort, enabling teams to accelerate the delivery of outstanding software to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">their customers.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">Set environment rules in deployment strategies</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">A central principle that should be followed is establishing environmental consistency and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker590"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">the ability to track progress seamlessly throughout the various stages encompassing the build, testing, and delivery layers of your SDLC. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">You must be mindful of the potential consequences when introducing conditionality in one environment while neglecting to do so in other environments as this is a bad idea. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.3">Maintaining environmental consistency will expedite the process of software testing in each environment, even if production contains unique conditions that are absent in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">other environments.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">It is advisable to use a configuration file’s declarative syntax to treat environments as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">input parameters</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.2">When it comes to CI/CD pipelines, this is a winning approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.3">Parameterizing your environment as code helps guarantee that all prerequisites are standardized from development to release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.4">Additionally, your CI/CD system will be easier to maintain as a result of parameterization, which will prevent an excessive number of pipelines from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">being created.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">Protect against unauthorized access to CI/CD pipeline infrastructure</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">To prevent unwanted access to your systems and code, all the systems involved in your CI/CD pipeline must be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">securely integrated.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">In all </span><a id="_idIndexMarker591"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">situations, the principle of least privilege should be applied. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">Access and permissions granted to users, tools, and services should be kept at a bare minimum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.3">By doing so, you may be assured that your organization’s most private information and systems are safe from prying eyes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.4">Additionally, you must encrypt any private information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.5">If it is pragmatic to do so, utilize ephemeral tokens that can only be used once and are automatically rotated after each job </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">is completed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">You </span><a id="_idIndexMarker592"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">should always be doing regular security tests on all of your dependencies using a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">static application security testing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">SAST</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">) tool. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">These tests should cover everything from your CI/CD processes to your code base to your underlying systems, such as containers.  </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.3">Some tools can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to conduct automated scans of your code base for any known security flaws and to notify the appropriate teams if any flaws are detected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.4">Some examples include </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">SonarQube</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">Fortify</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">CheckMarx</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">and </span></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">Veracode</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">Finally, carry out security inspections regularly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">The purpose of these audits is to offer recommendations for strengthening your organization’s overall security posture, as well as to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker593"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">document any findings, which may include any problems or vulnerabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">By staying on top of your security testing and being organized, you will be well-positioned to respond to a security incident at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">your organization.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">Monitor CI/CD pipeline performance</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">Key metrics for evaluating the performance of CI/CD processes typically include deployment frequency, lead time for changes, time to restore service, and change failure </span><a id="_idIndexMarker594"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">rate. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">The measurement of these indicators can assist organizations in identifying potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies within their broader CI/CD workflow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">Additionally, they can be utilized to monitor the effects of governance policies and procedures on the deployment of new code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">to customers.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">Understanding branching strategies</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">The majority of contemporary version control systems offer support for branches, which are autonomous streams of work that originate from a core code base. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">The nomenclature for the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">primary</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1"> branch in a version control system may vary, with possible designations including master, mainline, default, and trunk, depending on the specific system in use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">Developers can generate branches derived from the source, therefore enabling them to function autonomously in conjunction </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">with it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">The practice </span><a id="_idIndexMarker602"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">of branching facilitates seamless collaboration across teams of developers within a unified code repository. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">When a software developer starts creating a branch inside a version control system, a duplicate of the code base is generated, capturing the state of the code at that specific moment in time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.3">Modifications made to the branch do not have an impact on the other developers within the team, but this pattern is undoubtedly advantageous. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.4">However, it is not strictly necessary for branches to exist in isolation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.5">With branching, developers can seamlessly integrate changes made by fellow programmers to engage in collaborative development efforts that could relate to a variety of features, all while simultaneously ensuring that their branches remain closely aligned with the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">main branch.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">The successful implementation of a branching strategy will play a critical part in building effective DevOps workflows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">Many of the key objectives of DevOps release management is to provide a rapid, optimized, and effective workflow while ensuring the integrity and excellence of the final deliverable(s). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.3">The branching strategy that a software development team operates with and how they handle each new feature, upgrade, or bug fix should be managed by a well-planned branching strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.4">Doing this will simplify the release process by letting software engineers work on individual features at a time without affecting other parts of the product or interfering with another </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">team’s work.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">Choosing a branching strategy</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">The needs of the users and the requirements of the project should be taken into full consideration </span><a id="_idIndexMarker603"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">during the selection process for a branching strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">This selection is heavily influenced by a variety of factors, including the process of creation, the scale, and the tastes of the developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.3">Which branching strategies that you use in your DevOps pipeline are influenced by different factors, such as the availability of CI/CD integrations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.4">It’s not a good idea to use branching strategies in a DevOps-centric organization if they are incompatible with CI/CD or make it harder </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">to establish.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">Defining an effective branching strategy offers you a well-understood trajectory for the progression of the development process, originating with prototype revisions and culminating with the final production deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">This approach empowers developers to generate workflows that facilitate well-organized releases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.3">As eluded to earlier, a key advantage of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker604"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">having a well-defined branching strategy is to enable parallel development, a tactic that enhances the efficiency of each developer’s workflow without introducing any significant headwinds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.2">Branching strategies also offer seamless integrations with many DevOps technologies and workflows in an efficient manner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.3">For advanced teams, branching strategies also open the door to deploying with GitOps workflows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.4">Perhaps the best-understood advantage of using a branching strategy is its ability to facilitate rapid release cycles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.5">The bottom line is that there are no one-size-fits-all techniques available when considering which branching strategy is right </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">for you.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">As described previously, within the context of GitLab Flow, the process of software development takes place within three distinct environmental branches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.2">These branches serve as designated spaces for verifying and testing code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.3">Once the code has undergone the necessary scrutiny and has been deemed suitable, it is merged into the other branches, starting with the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">master</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1"> branch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.2">This iterative merging process continues until the code eventually reaches the production branch, which signifies its readiness for deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.3">Let’s consider the details of the three aforementioned branches in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">the environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">The master </span><a id="_idIndexMarker628"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">environment serves as the primary site for all developmental activities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.2">The developers establish distinct branches for the specific feature or </span><a id="_idIndexMarker629"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">bug fixes they are currently working on and subsequently integrate these branches into the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">master</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1"> (main) branch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.2">Subsequently, the new code changes will undergo an additional level of evaluation and automated testing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.3">Once new features and bug fixes are deemed ready for release, the source code will get merged from the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">master</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1"> branch into a </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">pre-production</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1"> (</span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">staging</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">) branch, which is the initial phase of production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.2">Then, the aforementioned code will undergo further testing and finally get merged into the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">production</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1"> branch </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">for deployment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">The term </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">production</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1"> refers to the process of creating goods or services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.2">Upon integrating production-ready code, it becomes acceptable to deploy this branch directly into the production environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.3">This is the branch that’s dedicated to this specific environment and will consist exclusively of code that has been thoroughly tested and is deemed suitable for deployment </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">to production.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">One advantage of GitLab Flow is that implementing GitLab ensures effective separation between different development contexts, guaranteeing a pristine state within each branch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.2">Also, the software seamlessly fits into CI/CD pipelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.3">In short, GitLab Flow enhances the GitHub flow methodology by optimizing the workflow inside a DevOps ecosystem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.4">Another benefit of GitLab Flow is that the Git history is more easily accessible and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1">visually organized.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1">One disadvantage of GitLab Flow is the added work of coordinating many environmental branches, which can make implementation difficult. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.2">If not managed well, development forks can become tangled and confusing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.3">Because of its flexibility, you must carefully consider how </span><a id="_idIndexMarker630"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1">you will utilize it, making it less straightforward to use than it could be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.2">Ensure that everyone on your team is aware of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker631"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1">the optional branches you want </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1">to use.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1">All of the branching strategies that have been mentioned up to this point have been tested and proven, making them a good choice for managing your source code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.2">However, each approach </span><a id="_idIndexMarker632"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">possesses a unique set of advantages and disadvantages, and you shouldn’t blindly accept one over another without doing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1">an evaluation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">For example, in contexts where DevOps processes are constantly evolving, the standard Gitflow will not be the best option. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.2">All of the other solutions that have been presented here make an effort to enhance Gitflow and modernize it so that it is compatible with an agile DevOps process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.3">Therefore, as usual, you will need to decide on an ideal strategy that fits all of your requirements and works for the operations of your unique business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.4">When making this decision, it is </span><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1">important to consider the customer, the company, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">your team.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">The ultimate goal of a branching strategy is to regulate and organize the changes that each team member makes to a code base into a single release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.2">However, orchestrating all these changes involves more than just writing code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.3">For example, a new release must be deployed somehow, and that’s where a release pipeline </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">comes in.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">Exploring release pipelines</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">A </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">release pipeline</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1"> is a workflow </span><a id="_idIndexMarker633"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">or a collection of steps that are undertaken to guarantee the swift implementation of recently delivered code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.2">Fundamentally, a well-built release pipeline makes delivery to production quick, easy, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">and reliable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">The exact </span><a id="_idIndexMarker634"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">stages of a release pipeline are different for each organization and product, but they often follow one another linearly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.2">Notably, a more complex pipeline design may include steps that can be executed in parallel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.3">This trend has become more popular in recent years due to the strategic advantages that parallel processing provides, but also because contemporary tooling has advanced well enough to make this functionality easier to implement without </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">extensive scripting.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">Typically, releases are triggered by an event, such as a code commit, although there are instances where the release might be explicitly initiated or scheduled in advance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.2">You may also wish to automate the execution of your pipeline until a specific milestone, such as the conclusion of pre-production testing, followed by manual authorization for the actual deployment into production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.3">For example, in heavily regulated industries, it may be desirable to incorporate manual triggers as conditions for completion, even though the pipeline process is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">initiated automatically.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">In most cases, having a proper release pipeline in your team’s portfolio of delivery strategies will mean the difference between deploying once a week and deploying multiple times a day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.2">But critically, where does a release pipeline fit into the spectrum between CI, CD, and continuous deployment? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.3">Before we can answer that question, we must understand all the components of a release pipeline, including the related infrastructure supporting it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.4">The following sections outline each element of a release pipeline </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1">in detail.</span></span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1">Provisioning infrastructure</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1">: This refers to allocating and configuring the necessary resources to establish and operate various applications and services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.2">This may require creating new virtual environments for testing purposes, or it may involve verifying the proper configuration of a test environment and even installing and activating the necessary services, such as a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">web server.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">Application deployment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">: This is the release process that requires the acquisition of packaged software and subsequent deployment into the designated server infrastructure, accompanied by the implementation of environment-specific configuration adjustments as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1">deemed necessary.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.1">Software testing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.1">: This refers to the process of conducting automated tests and disseminating the corresponding outcomes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.2">In addition, it is a necessity that you provide the capability to designate a particular stage as unsuccessful should the test execution yield </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.1">unfavorable results.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.1">Decommissioning infrastructure</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.1">: You should do this upon completing the pipeline phases, regardless of the outcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.2">It has become commonplace that teams leverage Kubernetes clusters to operate ephemeral pipeline phases in immutable container instances. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.3">The key advantage of this tactic is that container instances gracefully terminate all unpreserved resources upon the completion of their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.1">assigned duties.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.1">Certain tasks within the release pipeline may necessitate an asynchronous approach, requiring the pipeline to be capable of accommodating a variety of related situations, such as the ones mentioned here. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.2">As an example, consider an application release pipeline that requires server instances to be created in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.3">During the elapsed time between the beginning of infrastructure provisioning and the following deployment or testing of the application, it is necessary to allow for an interim period of approximately 1 minute. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.4">This window of time is needed to adequately prepare the environment for the forthcoming tasks of the release pipeline, avoiding a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.1">race-time condition.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.1">Artifact store</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.1">A code change typically initiates the release process, which culminates in supplied infrastructure </span><a id="_idIndexMarker636"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.585.1">and delivered </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.1">software artifacts</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.2">In this process, it may be necessary to tailor the packaged software to each environment by making it </span><a id="_idIndexMarker637"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1">compatible with the relevant requirements and then deploying it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.2">Hence, a repository for artifacts is the foundation of the release process, such as jFrog Artifactory or Sonatype Nexus </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1">Repository Manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1">The requirement for the artifact store is to facilitate the management of discrete artifact versions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.2">The key is to ensure that the artifacts that are collected concerning a singular build and subsequent release are both indivisible and separate from any other release, devoid of any form of intermingling or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">collateral interference.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">In previous years, the realization of this goal was accomplished through the establishment of a network share designated for the sole purpose of facilitating the build and release process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.2">Within this share, each build was allocated a distinct folder to ensure organizational coherence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.3">When it comes to release management, the persistence of artifacts is of utmost importance, regardless of the approach chosen, be it utilizing a database, employing a specific methodology, or even opting to store all data in object storage, such as an S3 bucket or Azure </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">Blob Storage.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">Configuration store</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">On the other hand, a configuration store is a repository that houses various values that provide </span><a id="_idIndexMarker638"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">consistency across a variety of build/release configurations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.2">For example, your CI/CD process and application’s build configuration data will likely be kept in a configuration store as a set of key/value pairs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.3">Commonly, these pairings are injected as environment variables or as input parameters, in the build environment, though information on job completion can also be included. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.4">Commonly, these values include critical elements such as connection strings, API URLs, environment-specific users, permissions, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">and others.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1">A release pipeline also needs to be able to extract the necessary configurations specific to a given environment during each corresponding stage of the pipeline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.2">Once extracted, the configuration should be used to facilitate provisioning and deployment processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.3">Notably, pipeline code can be made reusable by referring to the same parameters </span><a id="_idIndexMarker639"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">using appropriate values, depending on the environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.2">It is worth highlighting that the configuration store will ultimately include a portion of your production configuration, even if it is solely limited to infrastructure details. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.3">As a result, your configuration store must be fortified with robust security measures and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">encryption protocols.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1">Logging</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1">With DevOps, it is innately understood that, in the event of issues emerging during the execution of your pipeline, it is paramount that you scrutinize your logs to determine exactly where </span><a id="_idIndexMarker640"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.1">to look for problems and identify the root cause of the obstacles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.2">There are several popular log aggregation tools on the market, a few of which are Splunk, ELK Stack, and Loggly, just to name a few. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.3">In a complex system characterized by numerous dynamic components, it is strongly recommended to establish a mechanism for aggregating the logs in an effective way that facilitates awareness and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.1">swift analysis.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1">To ensure proper documentation, it is invaluable that all log entries be accompanied by, at the very least, the application name, pipeline stage, build number, and timestamp. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.2">After these requirements have been satisfied, any additional method you use to represent your log entries is entirely subjective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.3">The most fundamental system might simply compile them all together and make them searchable, but more advanced build pipeline systems will provide you with a graphical representation of the execution of your pipeline, along with the ability to drill down into the logs that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.1">they produce.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.1">Workflow execution</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">A workflow engine facilitates transforming manual workflows, typically driven by IT, into processes </span><a id="_idIndexMarker641"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1">that are managed by both humans and software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.2">This enables the routing and directing of information streams, allocation of tasks, and the establishment of collaboration channels to optimize resource utilization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.3">The underlying mechanisms of this process vary depending on the specific implementation, but the execution of processes is essential. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.4">Whether this pertains to a sophisticated bash script or a hosted workflow engine such as Jenkins, the tasks must be executed in a logical, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">organized way.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.1">The difference between deployment and release</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.1">By now, you may </span><a id="_idIndexMarker642"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.1">be wondering what the difference is between a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.1">deployment pipeline</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.1"> and a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.1">release pipeline</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.1"> since these two terms are often used </span><a id="_idIndexMarker643"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.1">interchangeably. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.2">However, deployments and releases are indeed unique! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.3">Deployment is a transition of software from one controlled environment to another. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.4">On the other hand, releases are a curated collection of software changes that are intended for end users </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.1">to experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.620.1">Here are </span><a id="_idIndexMarker644"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.1">some critical differences between </span><a id="_idIndexMarker645"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.622.1">deployment </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.1">and release:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.1">A software release is a set of changes to be delivered in the production environment, while a deployment is a transition of code built from one controlled environment </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.1">into another.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.1">It is typical for a release to get updated in production environments frequently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.2">In contrast, deployment is the last phase of the SDLC and it is executed across </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.627.1">all environments.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.1">Statistically speaking, releases have a higher risk of exposing end users to buggy versions, errors, and issues in the software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.2">Conversely, deployments occur in both the production environment and the development environments, which users will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1">never see.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">Release code may not be production-ready, while deployment code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">is production-ready.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1">Software releases are visible to users, while deployments can run in any target environment inside </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.1">the infrastructure.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.1">Stated differently, the business justification is the defining feature that differentiates a deployment from a release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.2">Commonly, release management leans toward being a business-oriented activity rather than a purely technical one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.3">Often, the rationale behind the decision to schedule releases is influenced by the business strategy, particularly in terms of revenue generation and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">portfolio management.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">With the various environments that are involved, it is evident that deployment does not necessarily indicate that users will have access to the features that have been implemented. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.2">Certain organizations may schedule their releases concurrently with their deployment </span><a id="_idIndexMarker646"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1">phases to production, while </span><a id="_idIndexMarker647"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1">others will opt to hold off until the company makes a final decision. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.2">This means that the new features could be approved for release in production but unavailable to users until they have been deployed at a future point </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">in time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1">At this point, you are familiar with the importance of having a sound branching strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.2">A good branching strategy that is appropriate for your team’s workflow allows you to logically organize the myriad of software changes so that cutting a new release becomes a straightforward process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.3">You’ve also explored what a release pipeline is and how to implement one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.4">However, with all these changes happening at once, how can they be managed in a sane way? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.5">What is the best way to show value for the hard work your team has put in? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.6">The answer is having sound change </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.1">management practices.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.1">Understanding change management</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">Digital services follow a life cycle that must be managed, and most organizations accomplish this </span><a id="_idIndexMarker648"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.1">through a set of dedicated change management processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.2">These actions commonly serve as the first line of defense toward mitigating the potential negative effects a change might have on operations </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.1">and security.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.1">To facilitate the implementation of changes throughout the system, change management </span><a id="_idIndexMarker649"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.1">methods typically involve obtaining clearance from external reviewers or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.1">change control boards</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">CCBs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.2">To validate compliance requirements, compliance managers and security managers rely heavily on change management processes to certify an entity’s compliance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.3">This is why you must maintain an aggregate log of all changes based on detailed records to unambiguously certify your build and release process, along with any other compliance requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.4">Most notably, many industry regulatory requirements often demand evidence that any modifications made are duly authorized and include a timestamp of when </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">they occurred.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1">According to findings that were published in the 2019 </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1">State of DevOps Report</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1">, the most effective method for implementing change approvals is to do so via peer review during the development process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.2">This method should be reinforced with automation to detect, avoid, and fix undesirable changes early in the SDLC. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.3">Continuous testing, CI, careful oversight, robust observability, and complimentary tactics offer early and automatic detection, increased visibility, and rapid feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.4">In addition to this, companies can boost their performance by doing a better job at communicating the processes that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker650"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">are currently established and by assisting teams to easily navigate those processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.2">Senior executives should go see the actual work being performed, comprehend the process, understand the work, ask questions, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1">and learn.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1">Higher performance is the result when all team members have full operational awareness of the change approval process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.2">Next, we’ll discuss how to pragmatically implement a DevOps-centric change </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1">approval process.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">Implementing a change approval process</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1">Reducing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker651"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">risk associated with implementing changes and meeting the requirements set forth by regulators </span><a id="_idIndexMarker652"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1">are two of the most significant reasons for adhering to the change approval process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.2">Separation of duties is a common multi-industry regulatory requirement stipulating that any changes to a process must be approved by an individual who is not the original creator of the process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.3">This ensures that no single person has complete control over the entirety of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1">a process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1">The conventional </span><a id="_idIndexMarker653"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1">approach to achieving these results has been </span><a id="_idIndexMarker654"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">to submit a proposed change to an external group for approval, such as a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">change control board</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.669.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.1">CCB</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.1">) or a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.1">change advisory board</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1">CAB</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.2">However, the DevOps Research and Assessment group has released studies revealing that these methods adversely impact the velocity of software deployments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.3">Moreover, the belief that formal, external review procedures lead to lower change-fail rates was unsupported by the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.4">These cumbersome methods increase the production system’s exposure to risk and hence increase the failure rates of changes because they slow down the delivery process and cause the developers to release larger batches of work less frequently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.5">The DevOps Research and Assessment group’s analysis of the data confirmed the validity of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">this theory.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">Instead, teams should concentrate on the segregation of roles, which can be achieved through the use of a peer review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.2">Furthermore, the platform that manages software development should be used to record reviews, comments, and approvals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.3">Additionally, you should make use of automation, continuous testing, CI, monitoring, and observability so that you can quickly discover, avoid, and remedy any undesirable changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.4">Finally, consider your development platform to be a product that, when used properly, makes it simple for developers to obtain quick feedback on the impact that their changes will have on various axes, such as security, performance, and stability, in addition </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">to defects.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1">Your objective should be to make your standard procedure for managing changes quick and dependable enough to be used in times of urgency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.2">In this new light, a CCB or CAB still plays </span><a id="_idIndexMarker655"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1">an important part in the continuous delivery paradigm, which comprises streamlining the process of team communication and collaboration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.2">Also, the CCB should facilitate the teams’ efforts to enhance software delivery performance through process improvement activities, such as hosting internal </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1">hackathons</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.2">Finally, leadership should offer input on strategic business choices that necessitate a balance between competing priorities, such as the choice between speed to market and business risk, or gaining buy-in from higher-ups in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1">the organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.1">The CCB’s new position is strategic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.2">The delegation of meticulous code reviews to practitioners and the implementation of automated processes enable individuals in leadership and management roles to allocate their time and attention toward more strategic endeavors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.3">The strategies of leading-edge software delivery organizations mirror this shift from gatekeeper to process architect and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.685.1">information lighthouse.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.1">Having too much dependence on a CCB to correct defects and approve changes is one of the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker656"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.1">most common mistakes found today. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.2">Choosing to conduct oversight using a CCB typically leads to extra waiting and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker657"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.1">unfortunate communication issues that crop up. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.2">While it is true that CCBs are effective at disseminating information about changes, many teams that operate across diverse time zones could be unintentionally misinformed regarding the significance of a new change or policy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.3">Whitewashing approval processes is another common mistake that businesses make. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.4">This implies that the inefficiencies of change reviews arise when all changes are subjected to a uniform approval process, preventing individuals from allocating sufficient time and individual attention to those changes that require focused consideration due to variations in risk profiles </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.1">or deadlines.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1">Another common mistake that companies make is a lack of investment in continuous improvement initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.2">To enhance the performance of the change management process, it is imperative to focus on key performance indicators such as lead time and change </span><a id="_idIndexMarker658"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1">fail rate. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.2">This necessitates providing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker659"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1">teams with the appropriate tools and training to facilitate their effective navigation through </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.1">the process:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.1">Finally, adding unnecessary processes is a common error that many companies repeat. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.2">It is frequently the case that businesses implement extra procedures and more rigorous authorization protocols in response to stability issues that are encountered during the software manufacturing phases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.3">Real-world analysis indicates that adopting this technique will most likely exacerbate the situation due to its impact on lead times and batch sizes, consequently producing a negative feedback loop. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.4">Rather than committing to this, allocate resources toward gradually building up the efficiency and security of the change-making process over time, but think of them as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.1">going hand-in-hand.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.1">Methods to enhance the change approval process</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.1">To improve your change approval processes, focus on implementing automated tests and the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker660"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.1">use of peer review processes to evaluate all modifications before they are committed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.2">Another way to improve the change </span><a id="_idIndexMarker661"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.1">approval process includes developing methods that automate the detection of issues, including regressions, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities, as soon as possible once code changes are committed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.2">Also, conduct regular analysis to identify and highlight high-risk changes and promptly conduct further investigations if any </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.1">are found.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.1">Additionally, it is good practice to implement methods that move validation steps into the development platform. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.2">This helps your team study the entire change process, look for bottlenecks, and identify potential solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.3">Instead of manually checking security rules as part of the software delivery process, they are implemented at the platform and infrastructure layer and in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.1">development toolchain.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.1">According to findings presented in the 2019 </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.1">State of DevOps Report</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.1">, improving software delivery performance can be as simple as doing a better job of communicating the existing process and assisting teams in navigating it efficiently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.2">This can have a positive impact on software delivery performance, even though the ultimate goal is to move away from traditional, formal change management processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.3">Outstanding performance is accomplished by everyone on the team having a crystal clear awareness of the procedures that must be followed to get changes approved for implementation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.4">This indicates that they are secure in their ability to get changes through the approval process in the shortest time possible and that they are aware of the processes required for all of the different types of changes that they </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.1">generally submit.</span></span></p>
