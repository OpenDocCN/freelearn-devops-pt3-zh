- en: The nightmare of any DevOps engineer is the 3A.M. wake-up call that says the
    systems their paycheck relies on aren't working. To combat these types of problems,
    it is critical to have information at hand that gives you and your team insights
    that can be used to quickly diagnose and remediate the problem. Even better, can

- en: This chapter will introduce the concepts of using OpenTelemetry to enable observability
    across distributed applications and reduce dependency on log analysis. We will
    continue the journey by demonstrating how application release workflows can be
    automated with Go and GitHub Actions, removing the need for human interactions
    that can lead to downtime. Finally, we will explore using ChatOps with Slack to
    enable insights across teams and remove toil from engineers tasked with deployments.
