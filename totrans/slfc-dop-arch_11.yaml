- en: Creating a realistic development environment is a cornerstone of effective system
    development, especially in complex and data-driven platforms such as Salesforce.
    One of the most critical aspects of establishing this realism is ensuring the
    accuracy and integrity of data used for development and testing purposes. High-quality,
    realistic data lays the essential groundwork for understanding how the system
    will truly behave once deployed in a live production environment. This is crucial
    for enabling developers to make informed design decisions and foresee potential
    pitfalls or issues early in the development life cycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary benefit of accurate, high-fidelity data is the sheer level of realism
    it brings into the development environment. When developers and **quality assurance**
    (**QA**) testers have access to data that mirrors real-world data, they gain invaluable
    perspective into how the system will function under live operational conditions.
    This realism permeates various facets of the development process, including the
    **user interface** (**UI**) and user experience design, core functionality testing,
    integration testing, performance testing, and more. Utilizing accurate data ensures
    the system is comprehensively evaluated and prepared for the intricacies and demands
    of production deployment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Accurate test data also plays an indispensable role in effective error detection
    and debugging. Bugs, defects, and inconsistencies in system behavior tend to surface
    when subjected to real-world data conditions and usage patterns. Unlike synthetic
    datasets or placeholder data, high-fidelity test data carries the full complexity,
    diversity, and nuances of actual live data. This means issues that may go undetected
    with fabricated or sample data will be revealed when exercising the system with
    accurate datasets. Early detection of defects then allows issues to be addressed
    promptly before they cascade into bigger problems down the line.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Performance tuning and optimization is yet another area where accurate test
    data delivers immense value. The performance profile and system behavior under
    real-world data loads can deviate substantially from that observed using synthetic
    datasets. By leveraging accurate load-testing data, developers can simulate real-world
    usage patterns and data volumes, identifying any bottlenecks, slowdowns, or capacity
    limitations. This enables precise performance tuning to ensure optimal throughput
    and responsiveness when the system goes live.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, realistic test data plays a crucial role in compliance testing
    and validating adherence to regulatory requirements. In highly regulated industries
    where standards compliance is mandatory, comprehensive testing with precise, real-world
    data is essential. This confirms that the system consistently meets necessary
    compliance needs when running real workloads. Compliance testing with inaccurate
    data carries the risk of missing violations that could occur in production.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The many benefits of highly accurate test data in development and testing cannot
    be overstated. It brings realism to the entire development life cycle, enables
    proactive defect detection, allows performance optimization, and ensures compliance
    validation. In development teams, it can also help to reduce ramp time for new
    developers and/or new development environments, as rather than having to build
    up realistic data piece by piece over time, a consistent, known good dataset can
    be set up relatively quickly Making the effort to curate accurate test data pays
    dividends in building highly reliable systems that function smoothly in production
    environments. This makes it a foundational pillar of effective Salesforce development
    and **continuous delivery** (**CD**) workflows.

- en: Seeding development environments with data is a crucial task to ensure that
    the testing and development carried out in these environments are reflective of
    real-world scenarios. In Salesforce, this often involves populating environments
    such as sandboxes with sample data from production – something that isn’t done
    by default by Salesforce and therefore falls upon developers, architects, and
    admins to carry out. This process not only furnishes the environments with realistic
    data but also fosters a better understanding of how the system will behave in
    production-like circumstances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The initial step in this seeding process is the extraction of data from the
    production environment. Salesforce provides various tools and functionalities
    to aid in this task. The data extracted can be a replica of the production data
    or a subset thereof, depending on the needs of the development or testing scenario
    and the capacity of your target sandbox environment. It’s imperative to select
    a representative sample of data that encapsulates different data scenarios likely
    to be encountered in production.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    environment, such as a sandbox. Tools such as the Salesforce Data Loader, Import
    Wizard, and Bulk API come into play here. They facilitate the import of data at
    different scales, ensuring that development environments are populated with data
    in an efficient and streamlined manner. We’ll look at each of these tools later

    of sensitive data, especially **personally identifiable information** (**PII**).
    When transferring data from production to development environments, it’s paramount
    to ensure that sensitive information is handled securely. This often requires
    the masking of sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access or exposure. As this
    topic is significant, we will delve into the details of data masking in a later
    section, focusing for now on the data seeding process.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Production data is not without its challenges and issues. Salesforce orgs typically
    have various validation rules and automated processes (such as workflows, process
    builders, or triggers) to maintain data integrity and automate business processes.
    These can become roadblocks when seeding data. For instance, an org might have
    a validation rule that prevents the insertion of Opportunities at the “Closed
    Won” stage, as real data is expected to progress through the entire sales process.
    This poses a significant challenge when you need to seed data that bypasses these
    usual stages for testing purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One approach to overcome this challenge is to create complex scripts that simulate
    the actual life cycle of records. This means scripting the insertion of Opportunities
    at an initial stage and then programmatically moving them through the required
    stages to reach “Closed Won.” This approach respects existing validation and automation
    but can be time-consuming and complex to implement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another strategy is to temporarily disable certain validation rules and automation
    during the data seeding process. This can be risky, as it involves altering the
    production environment’s configuration, and should be done with extreme caution.
    It’s crucial to ensure that these changes are well-documented and reversed post-seeding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    during data loads. For example, using Data Loader with the “Insert Null Values”
    option or specific API headers can help bypass some automation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important to understand that bypassing standard processes for data seeding
    can have implications for testing. If the seeded data doesn’t go through the usual
    business processes, it may not accurately represent real-world scenarios. Therefore,
    while bypassing validation and automation can make data seeding easier, it’s crucial
    to balance this with the need for realistic testing environments.

    datasets into Salesforce. For example, to import a CSV file with 200 new leads,
    you would navigate to the **Leads** object in Salesforce, click on **Import Leads**,
    and then follow the steps to map the CSV columns to the appropriate Salesforce
    fields.
  prefs: []

    just a few clicks, making it ideal for less complex data imports or smaller data
    volumes. Once the CSV columns are mapped to Salesforce fields, you simply click
    to import the data. With just a few clicks, the Import Wizard provides a user-friendly
    way to get CSV data into Salesforce. There are some limitations with this approach,
    though – you can only import one object at a time, and any lookup fields need
    to be mapped by their underlying ID values, as there is no lookup-by-name logic
    for this process.

    could write a script in Python or Java that leverages Bulk API. The script would
    read the CSV file, map the data to the appropriate Salesforce object fields, and
    then use Bulk API to load the records.

    thoroughly understand the relationships between different objects you intend to
    import. Salesforce data models often involve intricate relationships such as lookups
    and master-detail links. Ensuring that these relationships are correctly represented
    in your dataset is crucial. This means carefully mapping out parent and child
    records and understanding how they interlink, which can significantly impact import
    order and data integrity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the object relationships are clear, the next step is preparing and serializing
    the data for Bulk API V2\. This process involves formatting the data into a compatible
    format (usually CSV or JSON). Special attention must be paid to the way relationships
    are represented in this data. For instance, external IDs can be used to link related
    records instead of Salesforce IDs, which may not be available prior to the import.
    This step often involves cleansing and transforming data to ensure it aligns with
    Salesforce’s data standards and constraints.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps the most critical aspect of using Bulk API V2 for multiple objects is
    determining the order of operation. Since Salesforce enforces referential integrity,
    parent records must be imported before their children. Therefore, devising a strategic
    import sequence is essential. This might involve creating a dependency tree or
    hierarchy that clearly outlines the order in which different objects should be
    seeded.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Bulk API V2 is capable of processing large volumes of data efficiently,
    with large datasets, there’s always a risk of errors or partial successes due
    to data quality issues or Salesforce limits (such as governor limits). Preparing
    for these scenarios involves setting up appropriate error-handling and retry mechanisms.
    This could include parsing error responses from Bulk API and adjusting the dataset
    or the import process accordingly.

    for efficiency, consistency, and reliability in preparing development environments
    for realistic testing and development. Manual processes tend to be slow, repetitive,
    and error-prone, making them less ideal for tasks that require precision and speed.
    In contrast, automation eradicates these issues by scripting the processes of
    data generation, transformation, validation, and loading into the Salesforce environment.
    This ensures identical datasets in each sandbox or scratch org without the need
    for manual intervention, thereby saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    process to create a sizable and diverse dataset that closely mirrors actual business
    data. This script could be scheduled to run at specified intervals or triggered
    by certain events, ensuring a continuous supply of fresh data for development
    and testing activities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    implemented to ensure that the data aligns with the schema and business logic
    of the Salesforce environment it will be loaded into. This could include tasks
    such as field mapping, data type conversion, and data cleansing, all of which
    prepare the data for loading. Also consider data truncation – if the data generation
    is from production and the amount of data goes beyond the capacity of the target
    sandboxes, this will need attending to, of course.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    relevance of the data before it’s loaded into the development environment. Automated
    validation scripts could be developed to check the data for consistency, completeness,
    and adherence to business rules, thus ensuring that the data is of high quality
    and representative of real-world scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data loading process is the final step, where some of the tools we discussed
    earlier, such as Salesforce Data Loader or Bulk API, could be scripted to automate
    the data loading process. For instance, a script could be written to use Data
    Loader to import the data, handle any errors that arise during the import, and
    log the results of the import for review. This would ensure that the data is loaded
    into the Salesforce environment efficiently and reliably.
  prefs: []

    different development environments. By scripting the entire data seeding workflow,
    close-to-identical datasets can be ensured in each environment, thus providing
    a uniform landscape for testing and development. This is particularly beneficial
    in agile or **continuous integration/continuous deployment** (**CI/CD**) setups,
    where consistency and speed are of the essence. We talk of “close to” identical
    because taking source data from prod (and transforming/masking) on request could

    security of sensitive information, especially when transferring data from production
    to less secure development or testing environments. There are several approaches
    to enable data masking in Salesforce, and we’ll look at a few of these in turn:'

- en: '**Programmatic masking**: You can write your own custom code to implement data
    masking programmatically. This gives full control over how data is masked to meet
    specific needs. However, it requires expertise in both the data structure and
    Salesforce platform and can be time-intensive to develop and maintain.'

- en: '**Salesforce Data Mask**: This is Salesforce’s own managed data masking solution.
    It helps comply with data regulations by masking sensitive fields and objects,
    both standard and custom. Different masking levels can be configured based on
    data sensitivity, and once masked, the data cannot be unmasked or replicated in
    other environments in a readable form. Data Mask is installed and configured in
    a production org, and then masking is executed from sandboxes created from that
    production org. This helps protect regulated data such as PII in sandboxes mirroring
    production, enabling faster testing.'

- en: '**DevOps tools with masking**: Tools such as Gearset and DataMasker have built-in
    data masking capabilities. For example, Gearset can kick off a data deployment
    and then mask selected data according to configured settings before loading to
    the destination org. DataMasker quickly masks large datasets, prevents email and
    automation accidents, and aids compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
    It integrates with DevOps tools such as Copado and provides realistic masking
    formats.'

    enabling meaningful development and testing work on Salesforce environments –
    a crucial balance to strike. The right data masking approach is key to safeguarding
    privacy while allowing progress.

    approach to comply with data protection laws and follow best practices. Some key
    regulations related to sensitive data include GDPR, the **Children’s Online Privacy
    Protection Act** (**COPPA**), the **Personal Information Protection Law** (**PIPL**),
    HIPAA, and the **California Consumer Privacy Act** (**CCPA**), but this is not
    an exhaustive list. Here’s an overview of the aforementioned regulations:'

    to follow. Using data masking to obscure sensitive details while keeping data’s
    testing utility is recommended – some may choose to implement custom approaches
    to randomize data within specific ranges to maintain a degree of relevance. For
    example, take the `AnnualRevenue` field on Account – while a number, they’d never
    expect 1 or something and want to keep a similar sort of range to randomized data.

    Applying strong access controls ensures only those with authorized access can
    view your data, with **role-based access control** (**RBAC**) enabling tiered
    access. Excluding sensitive data from source control repositories prevents unauthorized
    access and breaches, even inadvertently.

    for realistic, meaningful testing. This includes preserving referential integrity
    and aligning with application logic so that your test data isn’t the cause of
    any issues or errors, creating false negatives in your testing work.

- en: Complying with regulations and following best practices in data management is
    vital for secure, effective testing. The goal with dummy or obfuscated real data
    is to ensure privacy and security while enabling productive testing and development.
    This careful data management greatly contributes to reliable, smooth DevOps processes,
    facilitating the transition from development to production with data integrity.
    A great best practice to start this process is to use the data classification
    metadata fields provided by Salesforce and ensure they’re accurate and populated
    for new fields going forward. Accurate information here will help audits, masking,
    and third-party tools.
