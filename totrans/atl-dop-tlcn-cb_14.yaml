    to core Atlassian tools and create a DevOps toolchain. But this often raises the
    question, “Is this it?”

- en: The good news is that Atlassian is continually adding new features to its cloud
    products that we have showcased throughout this book in previous chapters. Many
    of these features allow for easy interconnection between Atlassian products to
    improve visibility and status tracking.

    of **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) and **machine** **learning** (**ML**).

- en: Atlassian first introduced **Atlassian Intelligence** in April 2023, and it
    has changed the way users use Atlassian tools. Not all tools have Atlassian Intelligence
    enabled, but the main products – Jira, Confluence, and Jira Service Management
    – have exciting new features that make it easier to use these tools.

- en: Starting off with Jira, Atlassian Intelligence makes it easier to find issues.
    Prior to Atlassian Intelligence being available in Jira, users could create complex
    **Jira Query Language** (**JQL**) searches to find issues of interest. Now, with
    Atlassian Intelligence, Atlassian allows you to use **natural language** (**NL**)
    to simply ask Jira about issues you are interested in. Then, Atlassian Intelligence
    will write the JQL search on your behalf and return the relevant results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Atlassian Intelligence does not stop at helping you with your search queries.
    As you are creating issues, you can leverage the power of Atlassian Intelligence
    to help you create your issues. Atlassian Intelligence can help you brainstorm
    ideas and help populate a description of your issues. This can be very helpful
    whenever you need a little nudge or sprinkle of inspiration to get going.

- en: Finally, Atlassian Intelligence helps you change the tone of your writing. The
    tone is sometimes difficult to convey in written form, and the primary way users
    interact with Jira is through written words. This can lead to conflicts, confusion,
    and disagreements. Luckily, Atlassian Intelligence helps users improve their writing
    by rewriting text into different types of tones.

- en: Confluence also has some very exciting new features that are powered by Atlassian
    Intelligence. Similar to Jira’s JQL, Confluence also has a powerful search capability
    that allows users to find data. Historically, data searches through Confluence
    pages and relevant pages were returned back to the user. Now, with the power of
    Atlassian Intelligence, not only are relevant pages returned, but an answer to
    the user’s query is returned as well. This changes the way users search for information
    within Confluence because instead of looking for keywords and hoping that they
    find some information, Atlassian Intelligence builds an answer for you. The best
    part is that a user can use NL to ask their question in Confluence instead of
    relying on keywords.
  prefs: []

- en: Another Atlassian Intelligence feature in Confluence is the ability to help
    you look up words. Many teams have technical terms that are specific to their
    team or company. These technical terms are typically common knowledge for team
    members, but for new team members, it can be challenging to keep up with the definitions
    of all these terms. Luckily for these new employees, Atlassian Intelligence can
    easily search through all available Confluence data to help them figure out what
    a term means. This is great because it doesn’t go out to the internet to find
    what the term means but rather sources that data from the company’s personal data,
    which increases the likelihood that a relevant definition is found.

- en: One last Atlassian Intelligence feature worth noting in Confluence is the ability
    to summarize Confluence pages for a user. Pages tend to contain a lot of data,
    and it can be hard to fully digest all the information contained within a page.
    With Atlassian Intelligence, a user can receive a summarized view of the page,
    highlighting key pieces of information that a user should know about.

    it. Keep an eye out as Atlassian continues to expand the capabilities of Atlassian
    Intelligence and spread these to other products in the Atlassian suite.

- en: 'As you have learned in this book, setting up all the tools and getting them
    all configured is an involved process. At this point, you should have all the
    tools configured, and your DevOps tools should be ready for your team to increase
    their collaboration and efficiency. Next are some best practices that you should
    consider when setting up your toolchain to ensure a smoother time setting things
    up:'

- en: '**Define clear objectives**: Before you start deploying your DevOps tools,
    figure out what it is you want to achieve. Many different DevOps tools do almost
    the exact same thing, and picking between them might not be trivial. This book
    focuses on Atlassian tools, but there are many different alternatives. If your
    company’s objective was to stay within the Atlassian ecosystem, then this book
    set you up to meet that objective.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Select the right tools**: With a clear objective in mind, you need to select
    the right set of tools. As mentioned before, there are many DevOps tools that
    are very similar in price and functionality. Evaluate each tool, understanding
    the pros and cons of each tool with respect to what you and your team need. Avoid
    signing up multiple tools that end up doing the same thing because this only adds
    complexity to your DevOps tools and increases the overall spend and inefficiency
    of your team.'

- en: '**Standardize your workflow**: It can be tempting to create a unique workflow
    or process for each of your developer teams. Ideally, your company should have
    a well-defined process on how to utilize your DevOps tools. Avoid having unnecessary
    steps or steps that could create confusion for your team. Working out of the same
    operating model can help increase team collaboration, communication, and effectiveness
    since they will all speak a common language. Make sure your process is well documented
    and as you onboard new employees, they become familiar with your process. Refine
    your process regularly as you make new discoveries or get more efficiency out
    of your tools and processes.'

- en: '**Automate the process**: Automate as much as possible; this doesn’t mean automate
    everything. Automate parts of your process and toolchain that make sense. Don’t
    automate for the sake of automating. Having a human in the loop may be required
    until your team or process matures over time. Don’t try to automate everything
    on day one if your team doesn’t fully understand how to do the work manually first.'

    tools and processes. There is always room for improvement, and regularly revisiting

    guide your team through their DevOps journey.'

    no matter how great your toolchain is, make sure you encourage your team to collaborate
    and communicate. Your DevOps tools are there to help your team, but they should
    not be there to replace your team’s interactions with each other.'

- en: '**Training and development**: Finally, train your team on how to use your tools.
    DevOps can be confusing for your team, especially new team members who might not
    be too familiar with your infrastructure. Get in the habit of training new members
    and providing refresher training for existing employees. As you make changes and
    improvements to your process and toolchain, remember to update your documentation
    and, if needed, share those changes with the rest of your team. Encourage a culture
    of sharing new discoveries or better ways of using your tools.'

- en: In conclusion, DevOps is more of a journey and less of a destination. This book
    was designed to get you started and help you jumpstart your DevOps toolchain.
    As your team continues to utilize the tools that were configured in this book,
    you should continue to improve upon your toolchain and defined processes. In this
    book, we explored the entire DevOps lifecycle and covered configurations for Jira,
    Jira Product Discovery, Bitbucket, Compass, Opsgenie, and much more. This. is
    only the beginning. Your team will naturally continue to tweak and make changes
    to your configurations.

    of DevOps tools. The Atlassian tool suite is designed to work well together, and
    any team using Jira or Confluence should highly consider folding in the rest of
    the Atlassian tools.

    Now that you have a functioning set of tools, it is time for your team to really
    leverage the power of DevOps to take your software quality and software development
    efficiencies to the next level. DevOps is about continuously learning and improving,
    and your tools should follow the same practice.
