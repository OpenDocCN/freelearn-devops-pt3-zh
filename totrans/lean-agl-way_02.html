Though not necessary, having a basic understanding of Agile practices and frameworks, such as Scrum, will help you understand the information provided. For additional learning, we recommend Cecil Rupp’s book <em class="italic">Scaling</em> <em class="italic">Scrum Across</em> <em class="italic">Modern</em> <em class="italic">Enterprises</em>: <em class="italic">Implement</em> <em class="italic">Scrum</em> <em class="italic">and</em> <em class="italic">Lean-Agile</em> <em class="italic">Techniques</em> <em class="italic">Across</em> <em class="italic">Complex</em> <em class="italic">Products, Portfolios, and Programs in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Large Organizations</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">12</span></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Embodying organizational agility</h1>
			<p>In an era where rapid change and <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>unpredictability dominate the business landscape, organizations are compelled to adapt and evolve swiftly. Embodying organizational agility is no longer just a competitive advantage – it’s a fundamental requirement for survival and sustained success. As we delve into this section, we’ll explore what it truly means for an organization to be Agile, its benefits, and its transformative impact on every facet of <span class="No-Break">a business.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Understanding the foundations of business agility</h2>
			<p>At its core, agility <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>is built on a framework of principles, practices, and behaviors that equip organizations to maneuver effectively through complex environments. It’s not merely about reacting quickly but understanding and anticipating market dynamics to make <span class="No-Break">informed decisions.</span></p>
			<p>Central to this adaptive prowess is the embrace of fault-tolerant experimentation. This practice urges organizations to encourage innovation through trial and error, understanding that occasional missteps can offer critical insights, but minimizing risks through small and frequent change iterations. The freedom to test, learn, and iterate becomes a driving force behind <span class="No-Break">true agility.</span></p>
			<p>Beyond the buzzword, agility is a structured approach that relies on clear communication, collaboration, continuous learning, and adaptability. This chapter will explore the foundational elements that make up organizational agility, enabling businesses to navigate with foresight and fluidity in an <span class="No-Break">ever-changing landscape.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Applying Agile principles</h2>
			<p>Principles are<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> fundamental truths or beliefs. However, Agile principles go beyond mere suggestions. To act on them, we need to establish a new mindset emphasizing customer collaboration, a willingness to respond to change, and a focus on delivering real <span class="No-Break">value quickl<a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>y.</span></p>
			<p>Business agility is grounded in principles that enable organizations to respond rapidly and efficiently to changes in their external environment. Here are some fundamental principles that <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>support <span class="No-Break">business agility:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer-centricity</strong>: Prioritize customer needs and feedback, ensuring products and services are continually aligned with their <span class="No-Break">changing demands.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adaptability</strong>: Cultivate a willingness and capability to change direction quickly in response to new information or <span class="No-Break">changing circumstances.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement</strong>: Always look for ways to enhance processes, products, and services through iterative <span class="No-Break">feedback loops.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Empowerment</strong>: Trust and empower teams and individuals to make decisions while fostering a sense of ownership <span class="No-Break">and accountability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collaboration</strong>: Promote cross-functional teamwork and open communication to ensure alignment and <span class="No-Break">collective problem-solving.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Simplicity</strong>: Keep processes as simple as possible, but not too simple, removing unnecessary bureaucracy <span class="No-Break">and complexity.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value-driven decision-making</strong>: Focus on activities that deliver the most significant value to the organization and <span class="No-Break">its customers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transparency</strong>: Maintain open communication channels and provide visibility into processes, decisions, and <span class="No-Break">performance metrics.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quick feedback loops</strong>: Implement practices to quickly obtain feedback on products, services, and processes to make <span class="No-Break">rapid adjustments.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Innovation and experimentation</strong>: Encourage a culture of innovation where intelligent risks are taken, and learnings from failures <span class="No-Break">are embraced.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Learning mindset</strong>: Invest <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>in continuous learning and development, staying updated with technical capabilities, market trends and evolving <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resilience</strong>: Develop the capability to overcome setbacks and adapt to new challenges or changes in the <span class="No-Break">business environment.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By instilling these<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> principles within your team and across your organization, you can pave the way for an adaptive and responsive business that remains attuned to <span class="No-Break">market demands.</span></p>
			<p>As you progress through this chapter, you will learn how to translate Agile principles into strategic advantages. By recognizing how agility strengthens a company’s position in the market, you will be equipped to shape decisions that <span class="No-Break">enhance competitiveness.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Responding with agility</h2>
			<p>At its core, Agile <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>methodologies emphasize responsiveness. They ensure organizations remain nimble, adjusting swiftly to market dynamics, business strategies, and new opportunities. The essence of Agile is its iterative and incremental approach, allowing for rapid evolution in response to continuous customer demands, competition, and <span class="No-Break">market influences.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll explore what it means to be responsive over the <span class="No-Break">following subsections.</span></p>
			<h3>Supporting Lean practices</h3>
			<p>Agility <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>and Lean thinking go hand-in-hand. Lean focuses on removing inefficiencies and optimizing productivity. Later, you will learn that Value Stream Management (VSM) is a Lean approach to assess and prioritize the potential impact of <span class="No-Break">proposed changes.</span></p>
			<p>However, identifying and eliminating waste is just the start. Once Lean sets the direction by highlighting inefficiencies, it’s often Agile teams that step in with their adaptive, iterative methods to design and implement solutions that genuinely realize <span class="No-Break">Lean’s obje<a id="_idTextAnchor116"/><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>ctives.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s take a closer look at how Agile teams can support Lean <span class="No-Break">improvement objectives:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delivering customer-centric value</strong>: Agile teams refine and adapt solutions to ensure they continuously align with evolving customer desires, emphasizing constant <span class="No-Break">stakeholder feedback</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Eliminating waste</strong>: While Lean identifies waste, Agile teams design adaptive solutions to bridge gaps, enhancing productivity and eliminating inefficiencies in <span class="No-Break">every iteration</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Streamlining</strong> <strong class="bold">workflows</strong>: Agile teams further the Lean initiative by making workflows more efficient, leveraging collaboration and iterative feedback to refine <span class="No-Break">processes continuously</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Aligning production and demand</strong>: While Lean sets the balance, Agile teams ensure that solutions are flexibly tailored to meet changing market demands and shifts <span class="No-Break">in priorities</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reducing work in process (WIP)</strong>: Agile teams address excessive WIP, focusing on prioritized tasks and breaking projects into sprints for aligned <span class="No-Break">value delivery</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In essence, while<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> Lean Flow improvement opportunities help guide the work, by highlighting areas for waste and constraint elimination, it’s the Agile teams, with their flexible and collaborative approach, that bring these strategies to fruition. They are the problem solvers, the innovators, and the builders that turn Lean objectives into <span class="No-Break">actionable results.</span></p>
			<h3>Leaving the comfort of tradition</h3>
			<p>This section discusses<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> the traditional approach to managing projects, often called the Waterfall approach. You may already know this information, so feel free to skip this section. But, if you are unfamiliar with traditional project management practices, this information is vital to grasp how Agile practices differ. Moreover, there are still many areas where the Waterfall approach is better suited to managing large or complex projects where evolutionary change is <span class="No-Break">not feasible.</span></p>
			<p>The so-called Waterfall model is <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>at the heart of the traditional approach to development. Characterized by its sequential and plan-driven workflow, this model has been a mainstay in various industries, especially those where precision, predictability, and stability are paramount <span class="No-Break">and possible.</span></p>
			<p>In other words, the<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> Waterfall model still works well when the underlying activities of a product lifecycle are well understood, have little variability, and can be planned upfront. For example, the Waterfall model’s linear-sequential and plan-driven approach to project management works well in large and complex construction activities where the design, development, testing, and deployment processes are well understood and not likely to <span class="No-Break">change significantly.</span></p>
			<p>So, let’s take a quick look at the fundamental characteristics that define the traditional project <span class="No-Break">management approach.</span></p>
			<h3>Key features of the Wate<a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>rfall model</h3>
			<p>Here are some of<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> the key features of the <span class="No-Break">Waterfall model:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Contractual constraints</strong>: Projects initiated under this model are tightly bound by predefined constraints, encompassing scope, budget, schedule, benefits, quality, and risks. Often, these specifics are carefully detailed in formal charters or <span class="No-Break">contract agreements.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Linear-sequential workflows</strong>: One phase follows the completion of another, ensuring a systematic, <span class="No-Break">step-by-step progression.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Plan-centric</strong>: A significant emphasis is placed on planning, often before any learning has occurred, with little room for <span class="No-Break">mid-course adjustments.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Formalized change management</strong>: Since the goal is to plan in advance, changes are not typically welcomed, and significant changes may not be feasible - such as adding a new floor to a building under construction. Yes, it’s possible, but usually <span class="No-Break">not practical.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Overly-detailed documentation</strong>: Detailed documentation is not just encouraged but is often <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>deemed necessary, providing a comprehensive record of <span class="No-Break">every stage.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Heavyweight processes</strong>: The development model is predicated on robust, often cumbersome processes with stringent guidelines <span class="No-Break">and standards.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Strengths of the Waterfall model</h3>
			<p>These are some<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> of the strengths of the <span class="No-Break">Waterfall model:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Well-defined projects</strong>: The model thrives in scenarios where there’s clarity in requirements and processes. Therefore, when a customer’s needs, architectural considerations, designs, and methods are well-defined and not anticipated to undergo significant transformations, the Waterfall model is an excellent fit. For example, its often appropriate for constructing ships, buildings, utilities, and large <span class="No-Break">infrastructural projects.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Limitations of the Waterfall model</h3>
			<p>Some<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> limitations of the Waterfall model that Agile practices aim to <span class="No-Break">address are:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inflexibility to change</strong>: Waterfall’s linear approach makes it difficult to incorporate changes once the project is underway, unlike Agile’s <span class="No-Break">IID approach</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delayed feedback and testing</strong>: Software testing in Waterfall occurs after all development is completed, leading to late discovery of issues, whereas Agile emphasizes <span class="No-Break">continuous testing</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Longer time to market</strong>: Waterfall’s phase-based structure often results in slower product delivery, in contrast to Agile’s quicker iterative releases of <span class="No-Break">incremental value</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Limited customer engagement</strong>: Customer involvement in Waterfall is minimal after the requirements stage, unlike Agile’s regular <span class="No-Break">customer collaboration</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resource inefficiencies</strong>: Waterfall can lead to delays while waiting for other phases, whereas Agile and Lean ensure continuous customer engagement and better <span class="No-Break">resource use</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In rapidly<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> changing industries, where business requirements, market prospects, and customer needs constantly evolve, the Waterfall model often struggles to keep pace. Its rigidity often clashes with the demands of dynamic environments. In such cases, a development model that embraces change is essential for evolving business systems <span class="No-Break">and processes.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Our intent in highlighting the limitations of the Waterfall model is not to disparage its efficacy. Instead, it emphasizes that while it has its place, modern business challenges often necessitate a more <span class="No-Break">adaptable approach.</span></p>
			<p>The following sections will explore Agile practices, highlighting how they more effectively address these <span class="No-Break">dynamic needs.</span></p>
			<h4>Evolving to agility</h4>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>shortcomings of the traditional Waterfall model, especially in dynamic business environments, led to the rise of “lightweight” development methodologies. These methods originated in the software industry, defined by software engineers dissatisfied with Waterfall’s rigidity. These engineers, constantly under pressure for failing to meet frequently shifting requirements and wrestling with unrealistic deadlines, envisioned an alternative approach to development that was more accommodating <span class="No-Break">and responsive.</span></p>
			<p>A list of the better-known lightweight software development approaches is shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer016">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Lightweight software developme<a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>nt methodologies</p>
			<p>Although each lightweight method<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> is unique, they share the <span class="No-Break">following attributes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Small teams</strong>: These methods advocate for teams that are autonomous, self-directed, and complete with the diverse skill sets essential to carry out their <span class="No-Break">assigned tasks</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Iterative development cycles</strong>: A foundational tenet, these development and delivery cycles are typically brief, spanning one to <span class="No-Break">four weeks</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Incremental enhancements</strong>: Rather than attempting a ‘Big Bang’ delivery, the focus shifts to breaking work down and implementing new capabilities, features, and functions incrementally with each <span class="No-Break">new iteration</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product focus</strong>: Moving away from the short-lived nature of projects, the emphasis in Agile is on continuous enhancement and support for software products throughout their economically viable <span class="No-Break">life cycle</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer-centricity</strong>: Responsiveness to customers’ needs and priorities, plus a commitment to aligning each increment with customer feedback, is a hallmark of <span class="No-Break">Agile-based practices</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Change embracement</strong>: Change isn’t merely tolerated; it’s embraced, ensuring adaptability remains at the heart of the <span class="No-Break">development process</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">It’s crucial to underscore that while these methodologies were considered “lightweight,” it isn’t a commentary on their robustness or effectiveness. Instead, it’s an acknowledgment of their simplified processes that enables teams to pivot in the face of evolving <span class="No-Break">requirements effortlessly.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you understand how Agile has advanced beyond the Waterfall model for most software development projects, let’s quickly discuss one area where there is still some debate regarding <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>the best approach: <strong class="bold">Commercial Off-The-Shelf</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">COTS</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) software.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Managing COTS implementations: Agile versus Big-Bang</h2>
			<p>Many business and IT executives believe that enterprise-class Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>cannot be effectively deployed using Agile’s iterative and incremental development practices, as they <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>require the entire solution to be fully operational <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>from the start. Consequently, they may view Waterfall or Big-Bang approaches as more suitable for delivering a complete business solution all <span class="No-Break">at once.</span></p>
			<p>While we understand these concerns, we believe that Waterfall or Big-Bang (i.e., all at once) approaches may not necessarily offer a significant advantage. For instance, if your organization already has well-defined competitive processes, compliance controls, and financial and reporting requirements, replicating these within a new system may prove more complex and challenging <span class="No-Break">than anticipated.</span></p>
			<p>COTS software provides economic benefits by reducing development time and costs through pre-built, tested solutions. However, achieving a true competitive advantage often requires more than what comes out of the box. Implementing COTS typically involves substantial customization, integration, and data migration to align with specific business needs. The greater the divergence between your business processes, information requirements, and reporting needs compared to the capabilities of the COTS software, the more customization will <span class="No-Break">be required.</span></p>
			<h3>Addressing compliance issues</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Compliance</strong> is a critical <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>concern for many organizations, encompassing areas such as regulatory, financial, operational, legal, and corporate requirements. For instance, public companies must adhere to <strong class="bold">Sarbanes-Oxley</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOX</strong>) requirements, which mandate the implementation <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>of primary and secondary controls to mitigate risks. Since there is no standard set of SOX controls—varying by company size, industry, and risk types—organizations must tailor their approaches accordingly. SOX also mandates annual reporting to demonstrate accurate and secure financial reporting, driving <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>customization requirements for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (<span class="No-Break">COTS) implementations.</span></p>
			<p>When addressing compliance, both Agile and Big-Bang approaches offer distinct pros <span class="No-Break">and cons:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agile</strong>: Provides <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>flexibility and continuous feedback, which is beneficial for adapting to evolving compliance requirements. However, Agile may struggle with the rigorous documentation and comprehensive controls required by strict regulations like SOX. Additionally, rolling out customized processes, controls, and reports can be time-consuming <span class="No-Break">and complex.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Big-Bang</strong>: Ensures a <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>comprehensive implementation of business process customizations, data management, reporting, and compliance controls, which can streamline meeting both business and regulatory requirements. However, this approach involves higher risks and longer development cycles, potentially complicating audits and increasing the likelihood of significant issues. The extended timeline and accumulated costs can delay deployment and heighten the risk of discovering problems late in <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the end, neither Waterfall nor Big-Bang approaches will deliver a complete working solution faster. However, Waterfall and Big-Bang  approaches carry greater risks and potential delays due to the late discovery of issues, bugs, and defects. Therefore, we recommend using Agile practices, which support incremental roll-outs of new functionality throughout the development life cycle, offering ongoing improvements and adaptability. Even if your release deployment needs to be delayed incorporating necessary business processes and controls, you will know that you have a more robust solution to deploy when it <span class="No-Break">is ready.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we understand the early foundations upon which Agile values and principles are built, let’s look at how the business development lands<a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>cape <span class="No-Break">has shifted.</span></p>
			<h4>Transitioning to product-oriented thinking</h4>
			<p>Agile methods signify<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> more than just a tweak in development practices; they represent a holistic change in how businesses approach product and service delivery. They move away from managing projects to focusing on value delivery across the economic lifecycles of our products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look a little more closely at how these concepts <span class="No-Break">play out.</span></p>
			<p>In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, the outdated approach of organizing projects, with their finite timelines and clear endpoints, is no longer feasible for businesses aiming for sustainability and <span class="No-Break">continuous innovation.</span></p>
			<p>In his seminal work <em class="italic">Project to Product</em>, Mik Kersten underscores the necessity to pivot from project-centric mindsets to product-oriented thinking.<span class="superscript">3</span> Unlike projects, which often prioritize short- term goals and tend to operate in silos, a product-centric approach is holistic, emphasizing enduring value delivery and iterative refinement. Organizations can better align their IT endeavors with business outcomes by focusing on products and fostering a more integrated, responsive, and adaptive <span class="No-Break">IT ecosystem.</span></p>
			<p>This transition promotes a culture where teams are invested in the long-term success and evolution of what they build rather than just ushering a project to its conclusion and moving on. This shift is not just a change in terminology. It represents a profound transformation in organizational culture, strategy, and execution, making businesses more agile and resilient in the face of <span class="No-Break">technol<a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>ogical disruption.</span></p>
			<p>We must note that Kersten’s book emphasizes process efficiency and flow, which are lean concepts. However, Agile prioritizes adaptability and customer-centric iteration, and both development approaches are essential for modern <span class="No-Break">product development.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at how a product-oriented philosophy plays out <span class="No-Break">in Agile.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Iterative and incremental development</strong>: This approach embraces cyclical development processes, rolling out new product and service functionality across a series of <span class="No-Break">iterative increments.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rapid value delivery</strong>: Due to its iterative nature, Agile ensures that new value reaches customers faster, enhancing responsiveness <span class="No-Break">and adaptability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rethinking Waterfall</strong>: Agile doesn’t completely discard the steps of the traditional Waterfall model but re-imagines it. By incorporating Waterfall’s life cycle steps into repeating plan-do-check-adjust (PDCA) cycles, Agile transforms the<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> traditional single-pass flow into frequent, iterative and incremental <span class="No-Break">development cycles.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">The essence of Agile is adaptability. It allows organizations to remain attuned to shifting needs and priorities, ensuring they’re not just reacting to change requests but proactively steering their development processes to address customer needs <span class="No-Break">and priorities.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have defined the characteristics and principles of agility, let’s look at an event that brought Agile to the forefront of software development practices - The Manifesto for Agile Software Development, and the Agile methodology that became the de facto standard at the small team <span class="No-Break">level, Scrum.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Embracing Agile frameworks for collaboration</h1>
			<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>will revisit the event that brought Agile into the mainstream - “<em class="italic">The Manifesto for Agile Software Development</em>” - and the leading lightweight software development methodology that followed: the Scrum framework. We’ll start by revisiting the Agile Manifesto to understand its role in shaping modern <span class="No-Break">agile thinking.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Rediscovering the Agile Manifesto</h2>
			<p>In Utah’s snowy <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>peaks of the Wasatch Mountains, a landmark event transpired between February 11 to 13, 2001, at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort. Seventeen<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> renowned thought leaders from various corners of the software development industry convened. Their goal? To bridge their methodologies and discover a unified approach to software development. From this summit, the Manifesto for Agile Software Development was born. And it has become the defining description of what it means to be an Agile software <span class="No-Break">development organization.</span></p>
			<p>The manifesto (source: <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">https://agilemanifesto.org/</a>) reads the following. We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come <span class="No-Break">to value:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Individuals and interactions over processes <span class="No-Break">and tools</span></li>
				<li>Working software over <span class="No-Break">comprehensive documentation</span></li>
				<li>Customer collaboration over <span class="No-Break">contract negotiation</span></li>
				<li>Responding to change over following <span class="No-Break">a plan</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>"While we <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>acknowledge the value of the components on the right, we believe those on the left hold <span class="No-Break">greater significance."</span></p>
			<p>The manifesto also<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> outlines the Principles behind the Agile Manifesto. But since we provided a modern list of Agile principles earlier in this chapter, we won’t list the 12 principles here. If you want to learn more, you can find them <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html"><span class="No-Break">https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">This manifesto was more than a statement. It provided the collective wisdom of pioneers who sought to break free from the shackles of conventional, documentation-heavy software development processes. It marked the genesis of an approach rooted in collaboration, adaptability, and delivering <span class="No-Break">tangible value.</span></p>
			<p>So, time moves on, and as it does, people inevitably learn from their experiences and question what has become dogma. That statement is undoubtedly true for the Agile Manifesto. While still quoted often, some detractors feel we need to refine the original thinking. In the next section, you’ll discover some critiques and new thinking about what agility <span class="No-Break">means today.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Moving beyond the Agile Manifesto</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> Agile Manifesto has been the foundation of the Agile movement, driving change in software development and project management. Over two decades later, the world of technology has evolved drastically, and so have the contexts in which Agile practices are applied. This has led to debates and discussions about the current relevance of the values and principles laid out in the manifesto. So, let’s explore some of the current thinking and the evolution of the <span class="No-Break">Agile movement.</span></p>
			<h4>Expanding Agile’s horizons</h4>
			<p>Initially<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> designed for software development, Agile methodologies have expanded into other business domains, and even hardware development. With this expansion, there’s been a realization that some principles of the Agile Manifesto, while universal in spirit, may require rethinking to fit contexts outside of software development. For instance, the focus on working software as the primary measure of success needs to be translated differently in <span class="No-Break">non-software domains.</span></p>
			<p>This issue is a primary driver for our developing the BASE conceptual model and pattern language, which we’ll introduce in <a href="B21818_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Defining a Business Agility System for the </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Enterprise (BASE)</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h4>Harmonizing continuous delivery with Agile</h4>
			<p>The Agile Manifesto <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>has always emphasized customer collaboration and the ability to adapt to change. These are human-driven endeavors. However, with the expon<a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>ential growth in technology and user expectations, there’s been an undeniable push for continuous delivery and streamlined operations through advanced tooling, integrations, <span class="No-Break">and automation.</span></p>
			<p>This modern demand for seamless software delivery has drastically reshaped our understanding of agility. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, augmented by DevOps practices and tooling, introduce frequent integration of work, streamlined information flows, and a heavy reliance <span class="No-Break">on automation.</span></p>
			<p>This modern approach speeds up software development work and requires a shift in mindset. Being Agile is no longer just about iterative cycles and feedback loops; it now entails a deep integration of these cycles into continuous delivery processes, ensuring that agility permeates every stage of the software <span class="No-Break">development lifecycle.</span></p>
			<p>The manifestation of this shift is evident in the rise of DevOps and VSM. These modern paradigms champion holistic value delivery and challenge the traditional boundaries of siloed <span class="No-Break">iterative development.</span></p>
			<p>Merging the cadence of Agile iterations with the consistency of continuous delivery presents a dynamic blend, redefining how businesses approach <span class="No-Break">product development.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll discuss methods to integrate Lean and Agile cadences later in this book, starting with <a href="B21818_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing</em> <em class="italic">Basic</em> <em class="italic">Lean-Agile</em> <em class="italic">Solutions</em> <em class="italic">Teams</em> <em class="italic">(BLAST)</em>. For now, it’s important to understand that we can have more than one team working in collaboration across a product life cycle. This emphasis on product development has profoundly influenced the essence of operating as a value-centric Agile business, distinct from managing <span class="No-Break">constraint-based projects.</span></p>
			<h4>Expanding digital horizons</h4>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> section on transitioning to product-oriented thinking, we discussed the importance of emphasizing products over projects. However, the topic extends beyond just managing software <span class="No-Break">delivery products.</span></p>
			<p>As we transition from a project-centric to a product-centric mindset, we must recognize that products include all types of products and services, many of which are integrated as solutions. The <em class="italic">Internet of Things (IoT) </em>is a good example. Additionally, we need to be aware that software products can support value stream improvements for the organization, whether internally and externally facing. Today, everything from tangible products to processes and services can be enhanced through <span class="No-Break">digital tools.</span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Driving Improvements with Value Stream Management (VSM)</em>, we’ll underscore the importance of a comprehensive organizational improvement strategy, one that goes beyond just software. You’ll also learn how to make product-oriented, value-based <span class="No-Break">improvement assessments.</span></p>
			<p>Given the constraints on resources, it’s imperative to strategize where we can maximize returns on our investments. It may not always be linked to software. Yet, software and digital solutions can often be catalysts for transforming a process or enhancing a tangible product <span class="No-Break">or service.</span></p>
			<p>Given that all organizations have limited resources, we must evaluate where we get the biggest bang for our investments, which might not be software-related. Still, in many cases, software and digital services can facilitate a change in a process and a physical product or service. The generic VSM methods and tools we’ll introduce in <a href="B21818_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a> and the business intelligence strategy you’ll learn about in <a href="B21818_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor450"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Enhancing Decision-Making in the Lean-Agile Enterprise</em>, will help you make those types of business assessments and <span class="No-Break">investment decisions.</span></p>
			<h4>Embracing the rise of business agility</h4>
			<p>Agile<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> transformation has moved beyond IT departments. Organizations now see agility as a business-wide competency. This has led to discussions on whether the Agile Manifesto’s values sufficiently address broader organizational concerns, such as strategy, governance, and culture. Business agility encompasses  a  more  holistic  view,  considering  market  adaptability, organizational flexibility, and cultural agility. While the Agile Manifesto provides a strong foundation, some argue it may not be comprehensive for this <span class="No-Break">broader scope.</span></p>
			<h4>Revisiting the role of individuals</h4>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>Agile Manifesto values “<em class="italic">individuals</em> <em class="italic">and</em> <em class="italic">interactions</em> <em class="italic">over</em> <em class="italic">processes</em> <em class="italic">and</em> <em class="italic">tools</em>.” However, with the rise of digital tools and platforms that facilitate Agile practices (such as Jira, Trello, or Slack), there’s an ongoing debate about the balance between human interactions and the role of tools in enhancing collaboration. While tools help us visualize and streamline processes, the essence of Agile remains in human<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> cooperation. Finding the right balance is an <span class="No-Break">ongoing challenge.</span></p>
			<h4>Adapting to globalization with a distributed team</h4>
			<p>The manifesto emphasizes face-to-face communication. However, the global nature of today’s businesses often means distributed teams working across time zones. The COVID-19 pandemic further amplified remote working. This has led to questions about how the manifesto’s principles apply in such distributed, remote settings. Effective agility in this new context requires a mix of digital tools, revised communication strategies, <span class="No-Break">and trust-building.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, while the Agile Manifesto remains a foundational document, the evolution of the Agile movement requires continuous reflection and adaptation. The principles laid out in the manifesto provide a compass, but the journey of agility is dynamic, shaped by the changing landscapes of technology, business, and <span class="No-Break">global contexts.</span></p>
			<p>At this point, you should have a relatively comprehensive understanding of what it means to achieve business agility, both past and present. Now, let’s discuss the leading Agile framework, Scrum, and how it supports <span class="No-Break">business agility.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">This chapter uses Scrum as its reference Agile framework for individual team environments. We will also introduce team-of-teams (ToT) concepts for more extensive development and problem-solving requirements that require multiple teams to collaborate and integrate <span class="No-Break">their work.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Charting Scrum’s ascendancy in Agile practices</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> Scrum framework stands out among the various lightweight <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>software development methodologies, emerging as the predominant approach for small teams. For example, the <em class="italic">16th</em> <em class="italic">Annual</em> <em class="italic">State</em> <em class="italic">Of</em> <em class="italic">Agile Report </em>(2022) by Digital.ai underscores its popularity. The report notes that “<em class="italic">Scrum continues to lead,</em> <em class="italic">increasing</em> <em class="italic">from</em> <em class="italic">58%</em> <em class="italic">in</em> <em class="italic">the</em> <em class="italic">14</em>th <em class="italic">survey</em> <em class="italic">to</em> <em class="italic">87%</em> <em class="italic">in</em> <em class="italic">the</em> <em class="italic">current</em> <em class="italic">survey.</em>” The Scaled Agile Framework® (SAFe®) remains <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>the most popular choice for enterprises, yet only 26% of respondents reported using it, which is a decline of over 50% compared to the previous year. However, the survey’s scaling agility question changed which might account for the majority of <span class="No-Break">this decline.</span></p>
			<p>The official <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>Scrum Guide (<a href="https://scrumguides.org/">https://scrumguides.org/</a>) defines Scrum as “<em class="italic">a lightweight framework that assists individuals, teams, and organizations in deriving value through adaptive solutions for </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">intricate challenges.</em></span><span class="No-Break">”</span></p>
			<p>Scrum retains its leadership role for small teams because of its simplicity, flexibility, and proven success in promoting collaboration and adaptability in diverse project environments. Its iterative approach and emphasis on continuous feedback make it highly effective in delivering valuable products or solutions to complex problems quickly <span class="No-Break">and responsively.</span></p>
			<p>As we progress through this chapter, we’ll review how Scrum works. For now, it will be helpful to know that Scrum implements an iterative and incremental model of Agile via Sprints. Every Sprint, or development iteration, commences with a working hypothesis that can be tested. As the Sprint progresses, teams adjust incrementally, drawing from their observations <span class="No-Break">and experiments.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll take a quick look at the Scrum events that guide the flow of work across a Sprint, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em>, in the <span class="No-Break">following subsection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Understanding the Scrum Sprint cycle</h2>
			<p>The following<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> diagram details the Scrum events that guide <span class="No-Break">its workflow:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer017">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Scrum framework</p>
			<p>Work starts with creating <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>the <strong class="bold">Product Backlog</strong>, which is managed by the <strong class="bold">Product Owner</strong>, and<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> incorporating input from various stakeholders, including<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> the <strong class="bold">Scrum Team</strong> and customers. During <strong class="bold">Product Backlog Refinement</strong>, the Scrum Team clarifies the backlog items and<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> their priorities. The Sprint begins with <strong class="bold">Sprint Planning</strong>, where<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> the team selects the highest-priority work items from the Product Backlog, creating the <strong class="bold">Sprint Backlog</strong>. Sprints<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> are <strong class="bold">time-boxed</strong> development cycles, which means the durations are fixed, regardless of whether the Scrum Team meets its Sprint <span class="No-Break">Goal objectives.</span></p>
			<p>Developers pull items from the Sprint Backlog based on their capacity. Ideally, any team member can handle any job, but specialization is sometimes required. The Daily Scrum is a daily, time-boxed 15-minute meeting to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work as needed. The entire Scrum Team is responsible for creating a valuable, useful, and potentially releasable <em class="italic">Increment</em> every Sprint. Each iteration concludes with two events: the Sprint Review, where the increment is inspected, and the Sprint Retrospective, which allows the team to reflect on how to improve quality and effectiveness. The Scrum Master is accountable for the team’s effectiveness, helping it improve its practices and communication and <span class="No-Break">removing barriers.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve introduced the basics of<a id="_idTextAnchor129"/> Scrum, let’s review why <span class="No-Break">it works.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Applying Scrum’s foundational principles</h2>
			<p>These are the two <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>primary concepts that <span class="No-Break">underpin Scrum:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Empiricism</strong>: Scrum operates on the principle that knowledge is derived from practical experiences and iterative experimentation, making decisions based <span class="No-Break">on observations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lean Thinking</strong>: The Scrum Guide acknowledges the influence of Lean Thinking on Scrum, although it does not explicitly specify fundamental Lean principles, such as eliminating waste or improving value flow. However, Scrum shares several Lean concepts, such as focusing on adding value from the customers’ perspectives, delivering in short cycles, providing immediate feedback, respecting people, and <span class="No-Break">improving continuously.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To optimize value delivery, combining Scrum with Lean’s comprehensive concepts is essential. To accomplish this objective, the BASE and BLAST frameworks integrates the work of multiple Lean-Agile teams to support product and value stream improvements, streamlining work, material, and information flows, recognizing and mitigating constraints, centering work around specific products and services, and eliminating <span class="No-Break">wasteful processes.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Adapting to Scrum’s deliberate flexibility</h2>
			<p>Scrum’s founders, Ken Schwaber<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> and Jeff Sutherland, quickly point out that Scrum is an intentionally incomplete framework. Rather than prescribing a specific way of working or limiting the types of work it can be applied to, Scrum remains generically designed, offering broad applicability across various domains. In other words, Scrum provides a foundational framework to improve agility, whether the challenge lies in business, science, or <span class="No-Break">technical problem-solving.</span></p>
			<p>Scrum’s flexibility offers the <span class="No-Break">following benefits:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Widescale applicability</strong>: Scrum’s versatile nature ensures that it is suitable for diverse problems or business domains, granting teams the flexibility to address <span class="No-Break">various challenges.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Freedom of methodology</strong>: Development teams are granted autonomy within the Scrum framework. They have the skills and knowledge necessary for their tasks and can choose the best methods and tools that align with their unique <span class="No-Break">work requirements.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Framework adherence</strong>: While Scrum grants autonomy, it also emphasizes discipline. Every Scrum Team operates within the boundaries set by the framework. These guidelines serve as beacons, guiding Scrum team interactions and ensuring <span class="No-Break">harmonious relationships.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In essence, Scrum <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>provides a flexible yet structured env<a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>ironment, striking a balance between freedom of operation and the consistency of a framework. Note that a small team delivering the work is at the heart of every Sprint iteration. We’ll talk about <span class="No-Break">that next.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Amplifying team efficacy with Scrum</h1>
			<p>Whether<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> you’re a newcomer or a seasoned professional, understanding the dynamics of small teams can redefine how you approach work. Their inherent strengths foster clear communication, trust, and swift decision-making, all of which are crucial tools in today’s business world. The Scrum framework capitalizes on these strengths, introducing roles and artifacts that seamlessly fit into your <span class="No-Break">work patterns.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, you’ll discover how embracing the advantages of small teams can boost your career, enhancing adaptability, collaboration, and <span class="No-Break">tangible results.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Mastering the art of small teams</h2>
			<p>When empowered <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>and autonomous, small teams can act as potent problem-solving engines. Their limited size allows for nimbleness, a close-knit understanding among members, and a conducive environment for creativity <span class="No-Break">and innovation.</span></p>
			<p>Typically, an ideal small team in Scrum consists of fewer than 10 members. This size strikes a balance between diverse skills and manageable communication channels. Within such a group, every individual’s voice can be heard, leading to richer br<a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>ainstorming and <span class="No-Break">collaborative decision-making.</span></p>
			<p>Small teams are <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>better suited to address the intricate challenges with innovation and adaptability. In the following subsection, we’ll talk about how they foster an environment of collaboration <span class="No-Break">and innovation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation</h2>
			<p>Fostering <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>an Agile culture is vital. By promoting an environment where everyone feels invested in the outcome, where innovation is rewarded, and where collaboration is second nature, teams become more than the sum of their parts. They evolve into cohesive units that drive solutions with <span class="No-Break">unparalleled dedication.</span></p>
			<p>Managing Agile-based teams requires a different approach to the traditionally hierarchical and department structure. Moreover, the need to achieve  greater agility forces us to evolve our managerial and leadership strategies to foster a robust culture emphasizing collective responsibility, out-of-the-box thinking, and seamless collaboration. And everyone’s roles and responsibilities must change. Fortunately, Scrum provides some guidance in <span class="No-Break">this area.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Defining team roles and responsibilities</h2>
			<p>In Scrum, the<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> emphasis isn’t placed on rigidly defined roles and responsibilities but rather on clear accountabilities. The Scrum Team consists of the following three <span class="No-Break">defined accountabilities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Developers</strong>: Developers <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>execute tasks to achieve Sprint Goals, creating usable Increments of value-based deliveries during  each Sprint. They bring a diverse skill set tailored to their specific domain, ensuring the team remains a <span class="No-Break">self-sufficient unit.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product Owner</strong>: Bridging<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> the business and its consumers, the Product Owner collaborates with stakeholders to maximize the value of the product resulting from the work of the <span class="No-Break">Scrum Team.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scrum Master</strong>: The Scrum Master is<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> the cohesive force for the team, accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They address roadblocks provide guidance on Scrum,  and ensure the<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> team remains focused by guarding against external disruptions during <span class="No-Break">a Sprint.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The three roles in Scrum are minimally defined to ensure clarity of responsibilities and promote efficient communication within the team. The same simplicity carries over to other defined Scrum concepts, such as its artifacts, as <span class="No-Break">described earlier.</span></p>
			<p>This completes our section on leveraging small teams as problem-solving engines. Now, we will move on to the importance <span class="No-Break">of collaboration.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Facilitating effective collaboration through Scrum</h1>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> dynamic ecosystem of the modern professional world, collaboration and adaptability are not just admirable skills; they are necessities. This isn’t just about getting along with colleagues; it’s about orchestrating multiple teams with expertise and objectives, into a cohesive unit that consistently <span class="No-Break">delivers value.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, the principles and events of Scrum provide a roadmap to enhancing these collaborative efforts. By understanding and applying the empirical pillars of Scrum – <em class="italic">Transparency</em>, <em class="italic">Inspection, </em>and <em class="italic">Adaptation</em> – and acquainting yourself with its events, you’ll foster better teamwork, streamline processes, anticipate challenges, and swiftly adapt <span class="No-Break">to change.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we’ll discuss the broader collaboration challenges and then present Scrum as a <span class="No-Break">potential solution.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Encouraging cross-team collaborations</h2>
			<p>Large<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> organizations are often involved in numerous projects spanning diverse value streams and requiring support from multiple teams. While each team might have its area of responsibility or specialty, the overarching objective is best achieved through effective collaboration between these units. Such cross-team interactions don’t merely facilitate operations; they are pivotal in enhancing the <span class="No-Break">organization’s agility.</span></p>
			<p>Grasping the intricacies of cross-team interdependencies is essential for business agility. It requires a strategic approach to synchronize diverse workflows, integrate tasks, and <span class="No-Break">manage dependencies.</span></p>
			<p>Later in this <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>chapter, we will discuss Scrum-of-Scrum (SoS) and Team-of-Team (ToT) structures to support multiple streams of work. They offer a structured yet flexible framework to bolster this collaborative approach and harmonious synchronization across multiple teams. As we progress, we will elaborate on these concepts, providing insights into holistic <span class="No-Break">team integrations.</span></p>
			<p>However, first things first: the next two subsections delve into the foundational principles of Scrum’s empiricism and its five events. As you familiarize yourself with these concepts, consider their relevance and applicability in cross-team collaborations. Employed sensibly, these tools and techniques can be significant assets in your pursuit of organizational agility and <span class="No-Break">professional growth.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Exploring the three pillars of Scrum’s empiricism</h2>
			<p>Embracing <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>the nuances of Scrum requires a deep dive into its foundational tenets. In this subsection, we’ll be dissecting the empirical backbone of Scrum: the three indispensable pillars that hold the house of Scrum up – <em class="italic">Transparency</em>,<em class="italic"> Inspection</em>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Adaption</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transparency</strong>: Transparency<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> demands complete clarity on the team’s strategies, goals, and results. By utilizing tools such as JIRA and visual charts, every process step is clear to both the team and stakeholders, ensuring decisions are based on Scrum’s <span class="No-Break">actual state.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspection</strong>: Inspection<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> involves consistent and detailed assessments of the team’s progress toward Sprint objectives. Through Scrum’s structured events, deviations are swiftly identified, aligning outcomes <span class="No-Break">with aspirations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adaptation</strong>: Should <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>the results fall short of expectations, immediate corrective actions are vital. Scrum teams are committed to continuous adaptation, adjusting promptly as insights from <span class="No-Break">inspections </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker145"/></span><span class="No-Break">emerge.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By understanding how these three pillars work together, you’ll be better equipped to implement Scrum events effectively, enhancing not just project outcomes but also team dynamics. So, let’s move on to see how these principles interplay, guiding teams to make informed decisions, enabling continuous growth, and supporting proactive adaptations across the five <span class="No-Break">Scrum events.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Embracing the team of teams (TOT) approach</h1>
			<p>In today’s<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> business landscape, singular teams, regardless of their proficiency, often find themselves challenged by intricate problems that necessitate a broader, collective approach. This section highlights the importance of collaboration, from recognizing the limits of individual teams to strategically coordinating multiple units. In scrum parlance, these integrated team concepts are known as <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/><span class="No-Break">Scrum-of-Scrums (SoS).</span></p>
			<p>SoS is a concept that naturally evolved from the Scrum framework as organizations tried to scale their Agile practices to larger groups or teams. The origin of SoS is not attributed to a single individual but emerged as a way for multiple Scrum teams to coordinate and communicate effectively. In this book, we’ll use a more general term, <span class="No-Break">team-of-teams (ToT).</span></p>
			<p>The ToT approach has been<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> popularized in the Scaled Agile Framework® as an Agile Release Train (ART), the description of which is beyond the scope of this book. However, for those who want to dive deeper, check out SAFe® Distilled by Richard Knaster and <span class="No-Break">Dean Leffingwell.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">5</span></span></p>
			<p>By exploring the ToT concept and insights from leaders such as General Stanley McChrystal, our objective is to equip you with the understanding required to manage and lead in large and complex environments. This knowledge serves as a foundation for enhancing enterprise agility, fostering inter-team synergy, and ensuring cohesive, <span class="No-Break">value-driven outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>No matter how efficient a team is, there are boundaries to what it can achieve alone, especially when dealing with large-scale complexities. Recognizing this limitation is the first step to creating a holistic, <span class="No-Break">collaborative approach.</span></p>
			<p>When facing large-scale complexities, you will learn to recognize the limitations of relying solely on individual teams and understand the necessity of extensive collaboration across multiple teams to address these <span class="No-Break">multifaceted challenges.</span></p>
			<p>Orchestrating<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> the combined efforts of multiple teams requires skill. It’s not about micro-management but harmonizing. Regular cadence and synchronization, shared tools, and platforms, along with fostering a culture of open communication, ensure that the multiple cogs of this vast machine <span class="No-Break">are aligned.</span></p>
			<p>Lastly, you will enhance the ToT’s capability to steer collaborative endeavors, synchronize efforts, ensure harmony across t<a id="_idTextAnchor142"/><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>eams, and direct the collective toward continuous <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></p>
			<p>In managing all the activities across a product’s life cycle, except for the very smallest of companies, one Agile team cannot do it all. This is where the concept of a ToT becomes invaluable. It’s not just a scaling-up of resources; it’s about scaling collaboration, synchronization, and the shared ownership <span class="No-Break">of outcomes.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrated Workflow</strong>: A team-of-teams approach promotes interconnected value delivery, where each team’s output feeds into another, ensuring collaborative rather than just sequential integration <span class="No-Break">for success.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Managing dependencies</strong>: Multi-team environments come with dependencies. Recognizing and addressing them proactively is critical. This approach provides an overarching perspective to anticip<a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>ate and handle dependencies, preventing misalignments <span class="No-Break">and delays.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Synchronized delivery</strong>: More than individual milestones, a cohesive final product requires teams to align efforts. Scaled Scrum frameworks<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> such as the <strong class="bold">SoS</strong>, SAFe® <strong class="bold">Large Scale Scrum </strong>(<strong class="bold">LeSS</strong>), and <strong class="bold">NEXUS </strong>facilitate <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>this alignment, ensuring a <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>unified <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>solution that fulfills <span class="No-Break">overarching objectives.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Promoting collaboration</strong>: The ToT mindset goes beyond task integration; it instills a sense of shared purpose, mutual respect, and collective drive, solidifying teams as parts of a <span class="No-Break">cohesive whole.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In conclusion, as organizations strive to tackle more significant challenges and cater to diverse customer needs, the ToT concept becomes more than just a logistical necessity; it’s a strategic imperative. By fostering integrated workflows, addressing dependencies, synchronizing efforts, and nurturing a collaborative spirit, organizations can harness the collective strength of their teams, turning intricate challenges into <span class="No-Break">groundbreaking solutions.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Adopting insights from the ToT philosophy</h2>
			<p>The ToT approach is <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>fundamental when dealing with Agile scaling frameworks such as the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®), LeSS, SoS, and others. These frameworks specifically address the challenges of scaling Agile across large enterprises with multiple team<a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>s working on interconnected components of a larger product <span class="No-Break">or service.</span></p>
			<p>The developers of these competing frameworks actively seek to differentiate their approaches from a value-added perspective. Still, we can find some common ground among them. Here are <span class="No-Break">some examples:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adapting to complexity</strong>: This involves highlighting that in complex environments, hierarchical structures and traditional management methodologies fall short. ToT concepts provide a structure that’s both flexible and integrated, allowing for faster decision-making in rapidly <span class="No-Break">changing scenarios.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Shared mission</strong>: This is a crucial principle where everyone understands the mission and has access to the information they need to execute it. In the context of Agile teams, this means every team understands the broader product vision and how their work supports the larger and <span class="No-Break">holistic vision.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Empowered execution</strong>: Individual teams have autonomy and are empowered to make decisions. They’re not just following a set of predefined tasks but are dynamically adapting to the situation on <span class="No-Break">the ground.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">ToT Liaisons:</strong> Introduce ToT liaison roles to improve communication and manage challenges and dependencies <span class="No-Break">across teams.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These four guides help synchronize, coordinate, and integrate the work of multiple small teams, while also extending Agile principles and practices to a <span class="No-Break">multi-team environment.</span></p>
			<p>It is beyond the scope of this book to evaluate these disparate approaches and frameworks for scaled Agile practices.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, <em class="italic">Solving Complex Business Problems with Agility</em>, we explored the transformative power of agility in addressing intricate business challenges. We examined the essence of organizational agility, its dynamic response to evolving circumstances, and its relationship with Lean practices to enhance efficiency. The Agile Manifesto provided foundational values shaping Agile’s trajectory, while the Scrum framework highlighted its strengths in iterative project management, emphasizing the use of small teams as problem-solving engines and the importance of transparency and <span class="No-Break">continuous feedback.</span></p>
			<p>Collaboration was a key theme, underscoring the value of large-scale efforts in distributed environments, with insights from the ToT philosophy. These lessons equip you to harness agility for solving business problems, while offering a comprehensive understanding of Agile and Scrum methodologies. Looking ahead to <a href="B21818_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Establishing Lean Flows to Improve Productivity</em>, we will delve into Lean-oriented practices, Agile methods tailored to organizational contexts, and metrics tracking business outcomes.<a id="_idTextAnchor148"/> Join us to continue learning how to be both lean <span class="No-Break">and agile.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Answers</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The core principles of Agile include customer-centricity, adaptability, continuous improvement, empowerment, collaboration, simplicity, value-driven decision-making, transparency, quick feedback loops, innovation and experimentation, learning mindset, <span class="No-Break">and resilience.</span></li>
				<li>Agile teams can support Lean <span class="No-Break">organizations by:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Delivering customer-centric value</strong>: Agile teams refine and adapt solutions to ensure they continuously align with evolving customer desires, emphasizing constant <span class="No-Break">stakeholder feedback</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Eliminating waste</strong>: When Lean identifies waste, Agile teams design adaptive solutions to bridge gaps, enhancing productivity and eliminating inefficiencies in <span class="No-Break">every iteration.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Streamlining workflows</strong>: Agile teams further the Lean initiative by making workflows more efficient, leveraging collaboration and iterative feedback to refine <span class="No-Break">processes continuously.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Aligning production and demand</strong>: While Lean sets the balance, Agile teams ensure that solutions are flexibly tailored to meet changing market demands and shifts <span class="No-Break">in priorities.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Reducing WIP</strong>: Agile teams counteract excessive WIP highlighted by Lean, focusing on prioritized tasks and breaking projects into sprints for aligned tangible <span class="No-Break">value delivery.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>The two primary concepts underpinning <span class="No-Break">Scrum are:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Empiricism</strong>: Scrum operates on the principle that knowledge is derived from practical experiences and iterative experimentation, making decisions based on observations throughout <span class="No-Break">each Sprint</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Lean Thinking</strong>: While Scrum enhances agility and expedites delivery, it does not inherently encompass the complete breadth of Lean’s <span class="No-Break">value-stream principles</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>The three defining Scrum team accountabilities  <span class="No-Break">are:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Developers</strong>: Developers execute tasks to achieve Sprint Goals, bringing a diverse skill set tailored to their specific domain, ensuring the team remains a <span class="No-Break">self-sufficient unit</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Product Owner</strong>: Bridging the business and its consumers, the Product Owner collaborates with stakeholders to define requirements, ensuring consistent delivery of customer-focused <span class="No-Break">value efficiently</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Scrum Master</strong>: The Scrum Master is the cohesive force for the team, addressing roadblocks and ensuring the team remains focused by guarding against external disruptions during <span class="No-Break">a Sprint</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>The three primary Scrum <span class="No-Break">artifacts are:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Product Backlog</strong>: A dynamic and prioritized list detailing all work required for a product, service, or other deliverables and managed by the <span class="No-Break">Product Owner</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Sprint Backlog</strong>: A subset of the Product Backlog that comprises tasks handpicked by the developers for the <span class="No-Break">upcoming Sprint</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Increment</strong>: Represents tangible progress toward completing the Sprint Goal, which, in turn, represents a usable segment that contributes toward achieving the overarching <span class="No-Break">Product Goal</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>True. Scrum’s founders, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland are quick to point out that Scrum is an intentionally incomplete framework. Developers are free to use whatever skills, method and tools they require within their domain <span class="No-Break">of expertise.</span></li>
				<li>The three pillars of Scrum’s <span class="No-Break">empiricism are:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Transparency</strong>: Transparency demands complete clarity on the team’s strategies, goals, <span class="No-Break">and results</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Inspection</strong>: Inspection involves consistent and detailed assessments of the team’s progress toward <span class="No-Break">Sprint objectives</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Adaptation</strong>: Should the results fall short of expectations, immediate corrective actions <span class="No-Break">are vital</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>The five essential events of <span class="No-Break">Scrum are:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Sprints</strong>: Sprints are time-boxed iterative development cycles that last between 1 to 4 weeks. They establish a consistent rhythm or cadence for the <span class="No-Break">team’s workflow.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Sprint planning</strong>: As the kickoff to every Sprint, the Scrum team collaboratively defines the Sprint’s goals, ensuring they have a comprehensive understanding of the objectives. They also map out the specific tasks and assignments to realize Sprint’s vision and definition <span class="No-Break">of done.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Daily Scrum</strong>: The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute huddle where team members update one another on their progress over the past day, share plans for the next 24 hours, and highlight <span class="No-Break">any impediments.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Retrospectives</strong>: This reflective event occurs at Sprint’s culmination, offering teams a forum to dissect their processes <span class="No-Break">and methods.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Reviews</strong>: Showcasing the fruits of the team’s labor from the concluded Sprint. Stakeholders, including customers and end-users, provide feedback, enabling the team to gauge the <a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>success of their efforts and gather insights for <span class="No-Break">further enhancements.</span></li></ul></li>
