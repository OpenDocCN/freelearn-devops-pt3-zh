<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">In the fast-paced world of cloud native architectures, traditional governance approaches often struggle to keep up with the demands of agility, scalability, and rapid innovation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">As organizations embrace cloud native practices, they inadvertently fall into anti-patterns, which are inefficient or misguided behaviors that can slow progress, increase risk, and stifle innovation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">These anti-patterns arise from a failure to adapt governance models to the fluid, decentralized nature of cloud environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">This chapter explores how organizations must evolve their governance strategies to avoid these pitfalls and build resilient, adaptable systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.5">This chapter will cover the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">following anti-patterns:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">In the traditional IT world, governance</span><a id="_idIndexMarker375"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1"> focuses on a centralized structure of control. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">This changes with cloud native. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">Cloud native environments require agility, scalability, and decentralized decision-making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">Effective cloud governance ensures compliance, security, and efficient operations, which accelerates innovation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.5">Organizations can leverage automated policies, continuous monitoring, and the adoption of new services without compromising security, aligning cloud strategies with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">business objectives.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Organizations tend to see </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">governance</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1"> as an all-encompassing word for the technical and non-technical control </span><a id="_idIndexMarker376"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">mechanism for managing infrastructure and defining frameworks on which applications are run. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">While the all-encompassing aspect tends to lean toward the application of best practices (imagine, if you will, the use of playbooks/runbooks), what tend to be forgotten about are the non-technical aspects of governance, which, in turn, when mismanaged lead to anti-patterns and a breakdown of structure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">One of the major factors of this is the pattern covered in this section, dubbed </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">learning will </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">happen miraculously</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">The cost of ignoring learning</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Both upskilling and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker377"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">current stack knowledge in traditional organizations tend to be limited by the mindset of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">learn in your own time</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1"> or </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">we do not have time to train you</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Here is where engineers turn to one of two choices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">Either engineers will extend their tenure with a company for decades at a time working on one system, or they will look for other roles, thus leading to high </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">talent turnover.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">High talent turnover is a major challenge for engineering teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Each new hire requires onboarding, during which senior engineers must dedicate time to training, impacting overall productivity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">At a regular turnover rate of 2-3 years, this is expected, but once it turns into a 6-to-12-month turnover, it becomes a time sink and an overall loss. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">The 2021 Great Resignation is a good reference to this point. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">Each new engineer has an initial period where they are onboarded; without the necessary learning material, such as documentation, present, this then becomes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">a burden.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Time spent handholding, rather than having proper documentation present, leads many engineers to move on to greener pastures, as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">death by documentation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1"> is very commonly found among </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">tech-debt-heavy organizations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">This is a position you should avoid ending up in as time and money are lost, as well as losing out on innovation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">It has led many organizations’ infrastructure and software teams </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">to fold.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Having worked on the product and consulting side of IT, with a stint at a managed services provider, we have come across instances of this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">We can see why traditional organizations behave this</span><a id="_idIndexMarker378"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"> way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">For them, it’s </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">business as usual</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">BAU</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">) that matters most; looking through a short-term lens, this makes </span><a id="_idIndexMarker379"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">some sense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">On a basic level, what an organization focuses on is ensuring that their product is creating value, whether that is monetary or otherwise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">When faced with a task such as upskilling or creating documentation, it’s easy to just push engineers to “learn in their own time,” because, well, the eight hours of the workday should really be spent on the product, in their eyes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">I do want to note here that learning outside of hours is critical to career growth; even just an hour a day will pay dividends in the future. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.5">However, it should not be the only source </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">of education.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">In the long term, it fails; engineering talent ends up being locked into the bounded context of what their product is, and nothing else. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">How can you innovate or create value outside of your typical knowledge set if you are put in a position where there is nothing to gain from it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">For consulting organizations, this is great; this is where they step in and provide value and execute what otherwise could and should have been done by internal engineering talent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">For cloud organizations, this is a balance that needs to be addressed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.5">Without the freedom to learn during work hours, barriers are created so that when it comes to service/product improvement, outside help is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">traditionally required.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">When faced with a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker381"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> shared drive full of Word docs or countless Confluence pages, the concept of learning while working on the system, building or supporting seem like the better choice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">But organizations tend to take this concept too far. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">Not long after an engineer starts to understand the product they are working on, their entire time ends up being focused on it, leaving no room for growing their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">skill sets.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Providing resources and support for ongoing education and professional development is vital. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">Organizations aim to balance workloads to ensure employees have time to learn and apply new skills without excessive context switching. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">What we have seen in the decision-making process for learning/self-education at traditional organizations has been </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">as follows:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">This approach is rooted in the belief that knowledge and experience are foundational to creating a lasting impact. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">When employees are encouraged to learn and grow during work hours, they are better equipped to explore new technologies, implement innovative features, and drive the organization forward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">Without this commitment to continuous learning, companies risk stagnation and limit their ability to create distinctive solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.4">By integrating education into the daily work environment, organizations not only empower their employees but also ensure their long-term growth and adaptability in an ever-evolving landscape. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.5">This support can come in the form of access to training materials, workshops, and dedicated time for learning within the work schedule. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.6">This can be easily achieved by blocking out the calendar for training. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.7">If that time needs to be repurposed (e.g., for an incident), then that time block gets moved in the calendar. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.8">Be strict on rejecting meetings during that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">allocated time.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">Spotify offers an excellent case study of how embracing a cloud native culture can lead to transformative success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">When Spotify decided to move to the cloud, it understood that this shift required more than just technological change; it demanded a fundamental rethinking of their organizational culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.3">To achieve this, Spotify adopted a unique model centered around autonomy, collaboration, and continuous improvement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.4">The approach to cloud native is best exemplified by their creation of “squads”: small, cross-functional teams that operate with a high degree </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">of autonomy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">Each squad is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker389"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">responsible for a specific aspect of Spotify’s service and has the freedom to decide how they achieve their goals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">This structure allows teams to experiment, iterate, and innovate quickly without being bogged down by bureaucratic processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.3">The squad model also promotes a culture of accountability, where teams own their work from start to finish, fostering a sense of ownership and pride in the outcomes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.4">In addition to squads, Spotify introduced the concepts of </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">tribes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">chapters</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">, and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">guilds</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1"> to maintain alignment across the organization while preserving autonomy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">The following table goes into detail about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">each one.</span></span></p>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">Resistance to change</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">Employees </span><a id="_idIndexMarker392"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">accustomed to traditional workflows may resist adopting new cloud-based practices, delaying progress and causing inefficiencies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.2">For example, in a multi-cloud consultation with a fintech organization, despite the inefficiencies of legacy processes, such as taking two days to provision a new AWS account and relying on custom scripts, engineering teams were reluctant to adopt cloud native solutions to streamline workflows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.3">The organization also resisted third-party cloud management, so we used native tools from each cloud vendor for the respective </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">cloud teams.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">It is clear that engineers’ hesitancy often stems from multiple factors, with the learning curve being one of the most significant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">With every change comes the inevitable question: “How do we adapt?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.3">This fear is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">entirely valid.</span></span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">Offering comprehensive training and support</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">: This includes not only surface-level introductions but also deep diving into the new systems, with hands-on workshops, detailed documentation in Confluence, and Markdown files in GitHub, tailored to bridge the gap between old and new ways </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">of working.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">When decision-making is removed from those involved in the day-to-day operations, it can lead to a sense of disempowerment among team members, who may feel their expertise and insights are undervalued. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.2">This can reduce job satisfaction and increase turnover, further destabilizing the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.3">Centralized models struggle to scale effectively in dynamic environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.4">As organizations grow and operations become more complex, the central bodies become overwhelmed with decision requests, leading to slower response times and potential missed opportunities in fast-moving sectors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.5">For example, we have worked with large critical infrastructure organizations such as large telecom companies, where engineers on the ground might discover innovative ways to optimize network traffic, but their inability to implement changes without lengthy approval processes can lead to frustration and a sense that their technical expertise is undervalued. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.6">This detachment not only hampers innovation but can also lead to decreased job satisfaction and increased turnover, further destabilizing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">the organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">At scale, decentralized governance has seen much success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.2">Take the AWS example </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">that follows.</span></span></p>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1">Centralized governance solutions</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">Following a detailed exploration </span><a id="_idIndexMarker413"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.1">of the challenges posed by centralized governance, it becomes imperative to address one of its most debilitating factors: </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">calcified</span></strong> <strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.493.1">bureaucracy</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.2">This phenomenon </span><a id="_idIndexMarker414"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1">represents processes that become so rigid and outdated that they severely hamper an organization’s ability to innovate and adapt, qualities that are crucial in the rapidly evolving landscape of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1">cloud technology.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1">Symptoms of calcified bureaucracy</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1">One of the most glaring signs of this </span><a id="_idIndexMarker415"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">calcified bureaucracy is slow decision-making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.2">In many traditional organizations, decision-making processes become bogged down by an accumulation of management layers and procedural steps that no longer contribute value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.3">These layers are remnants of past structures, held in place by sheer inertia rather than necessity, leading to delays that are not only frustrating but also costly in terms of lost opportunities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.4">This symptom is mostly felt by larger and older organizations; we have heard this multiple times from those who work within or have contracted with government bodies where by sheer bureaucracy, change </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">is stifled.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">Another symptom is resistance to change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.2">Although we looked into this component in depth in an earlier section, it also relates to centralized governance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.3">Traditional organizations often exhibit a profound reluctance to adopt new technologies or methodologies, rooted in a fear of disruption. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.4">This fear is not unfounded, as new technologies can unsettle established roles and processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.5">But the resistance also stems from comfort with the status quo and an avoidance of the unknown. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.6">Such resistance can prevent organizations from staying competitive in industries where technological adaptability is key </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">to survival.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">Strategies for disrupting calcified bureaucracy</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">To combat the inertia </span><a id="_idIndexMarker416"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1">of calcified bureaucracy, especially in settings that require the high agility provided by cloud technologies, organizations can adopt several </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">effective strategies:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">Streamline processes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">: It is crucial to conduct regular reviews of all processes with the aim of streamlining them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.2">This involves cutting out redundant steps and simplifying procedures to enhance operational efficiency </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">and responsiveness.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">Empower teams</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">: Delegating decision-making authority directly to the teams on the frontlines can dramatically increase agility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.2">This empowerment allows those who are most intimately familiar with the issues at hand to implement solutions swiftly and effectively, without the delay of climbing up and down the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">hierarchical ladder.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">Promote a culture of continuous improvement</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">: Cultivating an organizational mindset that values the continuous evaluation and refinement of processes ensures that they remain relevant and effective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.2">This culture encourages innovation and the willingness to experiment, which are vital for leveraging cloud technologies to their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">fullest potential.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">By addressing the symptoms and root causes of calcified bureaucracy, organizations can not only enhance their adaptability and efficiency but also foster an environment that is conducive to innovation and rapid </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">technological adoption.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">The transition from a calcified to a dynamic and responsive bureaucracy is not just a shift in processes but a transformation in organizational culture, aligning it with the demands of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">cloud era.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">In the following section, we will delve into the critical role of a CCoE in navigating the complexities of cloud governance and ensuring that organizations maintain agility while avoiding the pitfalls of bureaucratic stagnation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.2">These frameworks are essential for clarifying roles, streamlining decision-making, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement in cloud </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">native environments.</span></span></p>
<h4><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">Lack of a CCoE</span></h4>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">The purpose of a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker417"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">CCoE is to establish a centralized team or function that plays a critical role in driving cloud adoption, governance, and best practices across an organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.2">We might ask ourselves here: “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">Why do we need a centralized team if we move to a cloud native organizational structure?</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">” Simply put, by establishing a CCoE, organizations can effectively manage their cloud environments, optimize business operations, and deliver enhanced value to their customers </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">and communities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">By tightly linking cloud initiatives with the organization’s broader business objectives, the CCoE ensures that cloud adoption is not just a technological shift but a strategic move aligned with long-term goals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.2">A key function of the CCoE is the development and enforcement of best practices and standards for cloud usage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.3">These standards are essential for maintaining consistency and efficiency across </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">the organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">The CCoE establishes guidelines for resource provisioning, cost optimization, and security controls, ensuring that all cloud activities align with the organization’s operational and strategic needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.2">AWS offers an insightful whitepaper on the topic of structuring a CcoE. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.3">Let’s dive deeper into its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">key recommendations.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">The following are some of the recommended strategies</span><a id="_idIndexMarker422"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1"> for creating </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">a CCoE:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">Define clear goals and a long-term vision</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">: The CCoE should have clearly defined, measurable goals that align with the organization’s overall business objectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.2">Establishing a long-term roadmap with ambitious projects will drive cloud adoption </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">and innovation.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">Develop deep cloud expertise</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">: The CCoE needs detailed knowledge of the target cloud platform, including its services, performance, monitoring, cost optimization, and security best practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.2">This expertise is essential for guiding the organization through successful </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">cloud adoption.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">Establish cloud governance and policies</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">: The CCoE is responsible for developing and enforcing cloud governance policies to ensure cost-effectiveness, security, and compliance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.2">This includes defining cloud architecture principles, deployment standards, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">automation practices.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">Measure success and iterate</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">: The CCoE should collect metrics and KPIs related to cloud projects and compare them to established goals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.2">This data helps determine whether the CCoE is providing the intended value and identifies areas for improvement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.3">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker423"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1">CCoE strategy should be adapted as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">conditions develop.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">In summary, a well-established CCoE is vital for managing cloud environments effectively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.2">It ensures that organizations can optimize their operations, innovate rapidly, and deliver significant value to their customers while maintaining compliance and security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.3">Without such a centralized function, organizations risk falling into fragmented efforts, missed opportunities, and increased friction and inefficiencies, especially in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">global projects.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1">As we conclude our examination of centralized governance and the importance of establishing clear roles and responsibilities, it’s critical to recognize that not all organizations are alike. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.2">While a well-structured governance framework is essential for maintaining security, compliance, and operational efficiency in cloud environments, some organizations may resist standardization, believing that their unique business needs are too specialized for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1">such practices.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.1">In the next section, we will explore this mindset in detail, discussing the risks and challenges associated with rejecting standardized governance frameworks and how it can lead to inefficiencies, increased risk, and missed opportunities in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1">cloud operations.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1">Our business is too special for guardrails or standards</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">This is a common misconception. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.2">In our experience, nearly every organization believes its IT environment is too unique or complex for the implementation of standardized guardrails or governance practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.3">However, when audit time approaches, these same organizations often find themselves scrambling to establish the very controls they initially resisted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.4">The perceived complexity masked a deeper hesitation to implement the necessary controls. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.5">Regardless of how specialized a business may seem, when it comes to compliance with government, financial, or industry-specific standards, these requirements must </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">be met.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">The true challenge lies not in the uniqueness of the business but in its willingness to overcome this reluctance and establish the essential </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1">governance structures.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.1">Understanding which guardrails to use</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.1">As our understanding of guardrails grows, to better utilize them, we should look at segmenting them into two sections: proactive </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.620.1">and detective.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.1">Proactive guardrails</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.622.1"> are essential </span><a id="_idIndexMarker429"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.1">in cloud governance because they prevent issues</span><a id="_idIndexMarker430"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.1"> before they occur, while detective guardrails identify and address issues after they have happened. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.2">Proactive guardrails play a crucial role in securing the cloud environment and ensuring compliance, minimizing the reliance on reactive measures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.3">Essentially, both preventative and proactive guardrails are designed to stop the creation of non-compliant resources in the environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.4">For simplicity, we’ll refer to them collectively as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.1">proactive guardrails.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.1">The benefits</span><a id="_idIndexMarker431"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.627.1"> of proactive guardrails</span><a id="_idIndexMarker432"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.1"> include </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">Minimize security breaches</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">: Implementing proactive measures and best practices from the start significantly reduces security incidents. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.2">For example, enforcing IAM policies that grant only necessary permissions can prevent </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1">excessive privileges.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.1">Ensure continuous compliance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.1">: Automated checks during deployment verify adherence to regulations, maintaining continuous compliance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.2">For instance, guardrails can enforce GDPR compliance by tagging personal data and restricting deployment to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">approved regions.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">Reduce operational overhead</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1">: Proactive guardrails prevent issues before they occur, reducing the need for manual intervention and saving resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.2">For example, enforcing resource tagging ensures accurate cost allocation from the start, streamlining </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1">cost analysis.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">Standardize deployments</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1">: Guardrails ensure consistent configurations across the cloud, reducing complexity and improving manageability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.2">For example, IaC templates with guardrails standardize security groups, patching schedules, and monitoring for all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.1">web servers.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.1">Accelerate secure development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">: Embedding security and compliance checks in the deployment process speeds up secure application delivery. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.2">For example, guardrails in CI/CD pipelines automatically scan code for vulnerabilities and compliance</span><a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.1">before deployment.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.1">Inconsistent application</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.1">: When GRC policies are applied inconsistently across different teams, departments, or projects, it creates discrepancies in how governance is executed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.2">These inconsistencies can result in gaps where certain areas of the organization are inadequately governed, leading to vulnerabilities that can be exploited. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.3">The inconsistency also makes it difficult to measure the effectiveness of policies, as different teams may interpret and implement them in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.1">varying ways.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.783.1">Lack of accountability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.1">: Without clearly defined roles and responsibilities, enforcing GRC policies becomes a challenge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.2">When accountability is not established, there is no clear ownership of compliance, making it easy for non-compliance issues to go unnoticed or unresolved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.3">This lack of accountability can lead to a culture where policies are seen as optional, further undermining the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.1">governance framework.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.1">Increased operational overhead</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.1">: Inconsistent enforcement of GRC policies necessitates additional resources to manage and correct deviations from established standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.2">This reactive approach is not only resource-intensive but also inefficient, as it often involves addressing issues after they have already caused disruptions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.3">The need for continuous corrections increases operational costs and diverts resources from more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.788.1">strategic initiatives.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.1">Complexity across layers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.1">: Enforcing GRC policies across various layers of the organization, such as network, infrastructure, operating systems, applications, data, edge computing, and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.791.1">web application firewalls</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.793.1">WAFs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.794.1">), adds a significant level of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker445"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.1"> complexity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.2">Each layer may have its own unique requirements and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker446"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.1"> challenges, making it difficult to ensure cohesive policy enforcement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.2">Additionally, managing cross-layer controls, such as credential scanning and ensuring consistent policy application, requires sophisticated coordination and monitoring. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.3">The complexity is compounded in environments where different layers are managed by separate teams, potentially leading to gaps in enforcement and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.797.1">increased risk.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.1">Without rigorous enforcement, even the best-intentioned GRC policies fail to provide the security, compliance, and risk mitigation that organizations need to operate safely and efficiently in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.2">Consistent enforcement ensures that GRC policies are more than just theoretical guidelines; they become integral parts of the organization’s operational fabric, driving compliance, reducing risks, and fostering confidence in the organization’s ability to navigate the complexities of modern cloud environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.3">With this in mind, we proceed to our final section, on missing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.1">feedback loops.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.801.1">In the dynamic realm of cloud computing, feedback loops are essential due to the rapidly evolving nature of the field. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.802.1">Feedback loops</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.803.1"> facilitate continuous improvement, allowing organizations to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker447"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.1">adapt and refine their cloud governance practices </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.1">over time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.806.1">In this section, we delve into the critical consequences of missing feedback loops, emphasizing the importance of a robust change management process and the necessity of shifting left to foster a proactive culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.806.2">We’ll explore how these concepts can be seamlessly integrated into an operating model, supported by real-world examples and discussions on cloud anti-patterns to illustrate these </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.807.1">key points.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.808.1">What are feedback loops?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.1">Think of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker448"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.1">feedback loops as the radar system of cloud governance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.2">Just as a radar scans the environment to detect changes and potential threats, feedback loops monitor the effectiveness of our cloud strategies in real time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.3">They provide us with continuous insights into how well our governance frameworks are performing, highlighting both successes and areas </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.811.1">for improvement.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.1">In the fast-paced world of cloud computing, where new technologies and threats emerge regularly, these loops are vital to ensuring our policies and practices remain relevant, effective, and aligned with our overall business objectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.2">Feedback loops operate by collecting data from every layer of our cloud infrastructure, from network configurations to application performance, and security incidents to compliance checks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.3">This data is then analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing us with actionable insights. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.4">By integrating these insights back into our governance strategies, we can make informed adjustments that enhance our cloud environment’s security, compliance, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.813.1">and efficiency.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.1">Why we can’t ignore feedback loops</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.815.1">Whether you are a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker449"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.816.1">Dev/DevOps/DevSecOps/platform engineer, feedback loops are essential throughout the entire cloud native organization for not only efficiency but also responsiveness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.816.2">In the case of alarms, they are immediate feedback providers when, say, CPU/memory or storage has hit a critical point, potentially bringing down our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.817.1">entire app.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.1">Now, feedback loops are nothing new to a traditional IT organization; they have been around for some time via monitoring tools such as Nagios and Zabbix. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.2">However, they only address a portion of the entire feedback system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.3">With cloud native, we want that to be from end to end – deployment tooling, operating systems, containers, serverless function invocations, all of it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.4">The question to ask is how much of it makes sense and will impact our organization if left ignored. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.5">To better understand this, let us look at why we can’t ignore </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.819.1">feedback loops:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.820.1">Continuous improvement</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.821.1">: Feedback loops are critical for identifying weaknesses in our governance framework before they escalate into larger issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.821.2">Whether it is tightening security controls, optimizing resource allocation, or refining compliance practices, feedback loops give us the ability to make continuous, data-driven improvements that keep our cloud environment secure, compliant, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.822.1">and efficient.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.823.1">Improved responsiveness</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.1">: Feedback loops enable us to pivot quickly in response to new challenges, whether it is a sudden change in compliance requirements, a new security threat, or a shift in business strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.2">With regular feedback reviews, we can adapt our governance practices on the fly, ensuring that our cloud operations remain agile and aligned with our organizational goals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.3">Here, we want a proactive setup with a reactive </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.825.1">response mechanism.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.1">Enhanced decision-making</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.827.1">: Gone are the days when decisions were made based on intuition or incomplete information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.827.2">Feedback loops equip us with the hard data needed to make informed decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.827.3">By monitoring key metrics, such as compliance rates, security incidents, and cost trends, we can gain a clear understanding of what’s working and what needs adjustment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.827.4">This data-driven approach empowers us to make decisions that are not only effective but also aligned </span><a id="_idIndexMarker450"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.828.1">with our long-term </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.1">strategic objectives.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.1">As we implement these feedback loops, we’re not just creating a reactive cloud governance framework; we are building a proactive organization that is equipped to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.831.1">handle it.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.1">Cost of time and effort</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.833.1">In the fast-paced world of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker451"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.1"> cloud native development, missing feedback loops can severely hinder the efficiency and effectiveness of the development process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.2">A lack of timely feedback not only slows down the development cycle but also increases the pressure on developers, leading to frustration, errors, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.835.1">missed deadlines.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.836.1">Consider a scenario where a development team uses GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of their applications to AWS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.836.2">While GitHub Actions offers a streamlined way to build, test, and deploy code, the absence of robust feedback loops in this process can lead to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.1">significant challenges.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.838.1">Without immediate feedback, the team might push changes to the main branch and initiate the deployment process, only to discover much later that the deployment failed due to a misconfiguration in the infrastructure or a bug in the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.838.2">This delay in discovering the issue means that developers are left in the dark for longer periods, unaware that their changes have introduced a problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.838.3">Consequently, they continue to work under the false assumption that everything is functioning correctly, which compounds </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.839.1">the issue.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.840.1">Slowed development cycle and increased pressure</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.841.1">The absence of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker452"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.842.1">feedback loops in this deployment process slows down the entire development cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.842.2">Instead of receiving immediate notifications about deployment failures or performance issues, developers only learn about these problems after they have had a chance to manifest and potentially affect the production environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.842.3">This delayed feedback forces the team into a reactive mode, where they must scramble to diagnose and fix issues long after they have been introduced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.842.4">The lack of proactive alerts means that problems are often discovered at the worst possible time, during critical production hours or just before a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.1">major release.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.1">This reactive approach not only slows down the development process but also places increased pressure on developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.2">With no early warning system, developers are forced to take on the additional burden of troubleshooting and resolving issues that could have been prevented or caught earlier in the pipeline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.3">The stress of constantly firefighting can lead to burnout, reduced productivity, and a decline in code quality as developers rush to meet deadlines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.4">To avoid these pitfalls, it is essential to implement robust feedback loops throughout the development and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.845.1">deployment process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.1">This exact scenario happened to a client of ours. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.2">We had built their pipeline from end to end, as an MVP, to show how well GitHub Actions and Kubernetes work together. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.3">To ensure consistency, we provided tests post-container build to ensure that the app could run. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.4">Given that it was a Docker container, portability was critical, so rather than testing on another cluster, we tested in the pipeline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.5">Post-MVP, more pipelines were built but did not include the testing we had created patterns for prior, and containers were shipped to Kubernetes clusters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.6">Without proper testing, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.847.1">chaos ensued.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.848.1">We would assume that non-production environments and test environments are not entirely business critical, yet in this case, the new containers brought down the clusters as they had caused other dependent APIs to fail, thus impacting other teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.848.2">In the case of GitHub Actions, integrating feedback mechanisms such as automated testing, infrastructure checks, and real-time monitoring can provide developers with the information they need to make informed decisions quickly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.848.3">For instance, if a deployment fails due to a configuration error, an immediate notification should be sent to the development </span><a id="_idIndexMarker453"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.849.1">team, detailing the cause of the failure and suggesting </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.1">possible fixes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.851.1">By incorporating these feedback loops, the development process becomes more agile and responsive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.851.2">Developers can address issues as they arise, reducing the risk of problems escalating into major incidents. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.851.3">This proactive approach not only accelerates the development cycle but also relieves the pressure on developers, allowing them to focus on writing high-quality code and innovating without the constant fear of unforeseen issues derailing their progress. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.851.4">The following diagram provides insights into where to apply </span><a id="_idIndexMarker454"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.852.1">feedback in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.1">development pipeline:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1033.1">In cloud native environments, governance must evolve to keep pace with the agility and innovation that these architectures demand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1033.2">Traditional governance models, often centralized and rigid, are ill suited for the decentralized, fast-moving nature of cloud technologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1033.3">As outlined in this chapter, organizations must shift from outdated, control-heavy methods to more adaptable and flexible </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1034.1">governance strategies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1035.1">This includes addressing critical anti-patterns, such as the assumption that learning happens on its own or the belief that a centralized approach will scale effectively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1035.2">By fostering a culture of continuous learning, encouraging feedback loops, and establishing clear, decentralized governance practices, organizations can avoid these pitfalls. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1035.3">Ultimately, cloud native governance is about empowering teams with the autonomy to innovate while maintaining security, compliance, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1036.1">operational efficiency.</span></span></p>
