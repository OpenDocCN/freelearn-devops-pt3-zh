			<h1 id="_idParaDest-413"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor417"/>Chapter 23</em>: Transform Your Enterprise</h1>
			<p>In this last chapter, we’ll talk about enterprise transformation. I’ll explain how you can put all the pieces explained in this book together to transform your enterprise into one with an engineering culture with increased developer velocity.</p>
			<p>We will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why many transformations fail</li>
				<li>Starting with WHY?</li>
				<li>Data-driven transformation</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-414"><a id="_idTextAnchor418"/>Why many transformations fail</h1>
			<p>Software is at the heart<a id="_idIndexMarker1414"/> of every product and service in every industry – from the customer experience to supply chain management (see <a href="B17827_01_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Metrics That Matter</em>). This means a lot of enterprises must transform to become digital high-performance companies, but many of these transformations fail. Roles are renamed, management levels are restructured, and hosting is renamed to private cloud, but often the culture and performance do not change. There are many reasons why transformations fail and I want to give you some examples here.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-415"><a id="_idTextAnchor419"/>Assuming your company or industry is special</h2>
			<p>Many customers that I meet believe that they are completely special, but they are not. And, I’m sorry to say, it’s probable that neither is your company or industry. At least, not when it comes to digital transformation. Could your product kill people if it has a defect? So could cars, airplanes, trucks, medical devices, and so on. And the same is true for all of the parts that are produced for these products. They are nothing special. Must you comply with certain standards? Do you create military products? Are you publicly traded? Do you work for governments? Whatever you think makes your company special, chances are there are many companies that face the same challenges that you do and the same rules apply to them as to you when it comes to your DevOps transformation.</p>
			<p>If you look at the studies<a id="_idIndexMarker1415"/> mentioned in <a href="B17827_01_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, you’ll find that they apply to all companies: from small start-ups to big enterprises and from cutting-edge internet companies to highly regulated industries, such as finance, healthcare, and government (<em class="italic">Forsgren N., Humble, J., &amp; Kim, G., 2018</em>, p. 22).</p>
			<p>But this is actually a good thing. This means a lot of the problems you’re probably facing during your own transformation have already been solved by others. You can learn from their failures and don’t have to experience them yourself.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-416"><a id="_idTextAnchor420"/>Having no sense of urgency</h2>
			<p>The biggest blocker to change is complacency. If people in your business are complacent, they will tend to resist change and keep on doing <em class="italic">business as usual</em>.</p>
			<p>You must establish a true sense of urgency for people to address critical things now. Urgency in this case does not mean pressure from management that creates anxiety. True urgency should drive people to change with a deep determination to win – not with anxiety about losing (<em class="italic">John P. Kotter 2008</em>).</p>
			<p>Without a sense of true urgency, people will resist change and are more likely to keep up their old behaviors. Note that a sense of urgency might arise for completely different reasons at distinct levels of your organization. Management might feel pressure from the market and the lack of agility to react with frequent releases. Engineers might feel the pressure of technical debt and the problem of attracting and retaining talent because of old processes and tools. It is important to align these stories to a common root course using a clear vision. Only if you manage to align the different senses of urgency into a single force that drives in the same direction can you ensure that the different forces will not neutralize themselves</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-417"><a id="_idTextAnchor421"/>Having no clear vision</h2>
			<p>It is easy to replace tools, processes, and roles, but it is hard to change behavior, culture, and stories. Without a clear vision, the transformation will not yield the desired results.</p>
			<p>If I hear customers saying <em class="italic">we are not Microsoft or Google</em> or <em class="italic">we are not a cutting-edge internet company</em>, it tells me that they are missing a clear vision. If your vision clearly states that you want to become the digital leader in your industry or change from a product company to a service company, people will not dare to say things that contradict it.</p>
			<p>A good vision to drive change<a id="_idIndexMarker1416"/> is a clear and compelling statement of where all your transformation leads (<em class="italic">John P. Kotter 2012</em>).</p>
			<p>I believe it is worth noting that DevOps transformations are not always driven by upper management. I know many companies where the DevOps transformation is driven by individual departments or even teams. Nevertheless, the same rules apply – you need a clear vision for the teams in your team or department and to establish a sense of urgency to ensure that the transformation is successful.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-418"><a id="_idTextAnchor422"/>Letting obstacles block your progress</h2>
			<p>When you start a transformation, many obstacles will block your transformation. Good examples that I often experience are certain regulations in certain industries. Many regulations, such<a id="_idIndexMarker1417"/> as ISO26262 or GxP, propose the <strong class="bold">V-Model</strong> for software engineering. The<a id="_idIndexMarker1418"/> V-Model is based upon the <strong class="bold">waterfall model</strong>, so it contradicts basically everything we have learned in many years of DevOps research. If you insist on keeping the waterfall model, your DevOps transformation will most likely fail, but this is due to your internal interpretations of the regulations. If you have a closer look at them, you’ll realize that they just insist on best practices. If your practices are superior to the recommended ones, you can justify that and still pass an audit.</p>
			<p>Most obstacles you’ll encounter are caused by your organization, for example, your organizational structure, tight job categories, processes, or trench warfare between the working council and management. Don’t permit these obstacles to block your transformation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-419"><a id="_idTextAnchor423"/>Not getting help</h2>
			<p>Consultants have a bad reputation in many companies, mostly because of bad experiences. I helped a customer once with digitalizing their product. The customer was used to doing everything in line with the waterfall method and I introduced Scrum and CI/CD to them. We did some training and used agile development successfully over the next couple of years. After two years, management paid an expensive consultant firm to introduce Scrum. They basically had the same slides and told the same story that I had told everyone two years earlier. This kind of consultancy leads to a bad reputation.</p>
			<p>But if you want to learn<a id="_idIndexMarker1419"/> a new sport, you don’t just buy the equipment and watch some videos on YouTube. You join a club or find yourself a coach that will guide you. Sports are not just about knowledge and tools – they are about building skills. And without an experienced coach, it is hard or impossible to succeed in certain sports.</p>
			<p>The same is true for building new skills and capabilities in your business. There is no shame in getting help from someone more experienced that can guide you through the change. The odds are high that help will be cheap based on what you save in time and effort, never mind the costs of failure.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-420"><a id="_idTextAnchor424"/>Starting with WHY?</h1>
			<p>For a transformation<a id="_idIndexMarker1420"/> to succeed, you need a clear vision and a sense of urgency. The vision should be precise, compelling, short, and should inspire people to follow it. To communicate the vision, you can follow the <em class="italic">Golden Circle</em> (<em class="italic">Simon Sinek 2011, p.38</em>) and communicate from the inside to the outside (see <em class="italic">Figure 23.1</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer281" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_23_001.jpg" alt="Figure 23.1 – Communicating a vision should start with WHY?&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 23.1 – Communicating a vision should start with WHY?</p>
			<p>Let us see in more detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">WHY?</strong>: The reason why your company <a id="_idIndexMarker1421"/>will undertake the transformation. This gives it a purpose and establishes a sense of urgency. Why should anyone care?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">HOW?</strong>: How are you going to succeed<a id="_idIndexMarker1422"/> in the transformation process?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">WHAT?</strong>: The actual thing that you want<a id="_idIndexMarker1423"/> to transform. What are you doing or making?</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-421"><a id="_idTextAnchor425"/>A purpose-driven mission</h2>
			<p>Don’t underestimate<a id="_idIndexMarker1424"/> the power of vision! If you are a manufacturer of combustion engine cars, transformation to electrical cars will not come easy. There will be resistance. People will be afraid to lose the power of their jobs.</p>
			<p>To succeed, you need a clear vision and to communicate the <em class="italic">WHY</em>? – like the Volkswagen Group in its <em class="italic">goTOzero</em> mission statement in 2019, which concentrated on four main fields of action: climate change, resources, air quality, and environmental compliance.</p>
			<p>By 2050, the entire <strong class="bold">Volkswagen Group</strong> wants to become balance sheet CO2-neutral. By 2025, the company plans to reduce the carbon footprint of its fleet by 30 percent over its entire life cycle compared to 2015 (<em class="italic">Volkswagen 2019</em>).</p>
			<p>This perfectly explains the WHY?, establishes urgency, and fits into their overall updated vision <em class="italic">to make this world a mobile, sustainable place with access to all the citizens</em>.</p>
			<p>Equally, <strong class="bold">Mercedes-Benz</strong> stated in their <em class="italic">Ambition 2039</em> statement from 2019 that they aim to have a carbon-neutral car fleet and production over the next 20 years (<em class="italic">Mercedes-Benz Group Media 2019</em>).</p>
			<p>And it is the same when you transform a product company into a software or services company. Even if you only transform from a waterfall organization to a DevOps organization, people will be afraid of the change and there will be resistance if you cannot paint a picture<a id="_idIndexMarker1425"/> of a desirable future and explain <em class="italic">why</em> you have to undertake the transformation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-422"><a id="_idTextAnchor426"/>Establishing an engineering culture</h2>
			<p>Having a purpose-driven vision<a id="_idIndexMarker1426"/> will help you to establish an <strong class="bold">engineering culture</strong> during your transformation: an inclusive and secure organizational culture that fosters talent and is driven by sharing and equality (<em class="italic">de Vries, M., &amp; van Osnabrugge, R. 2022</em>).</p>
			<p>This is a culture where people feel safe to speak up when they feel something is wrong, a culture where people feel safe to experiment and be creative without fear, and a culture where everyone feels welcome and safe – independent of heritage, gender, or religion.</p>
			<p>The culture of an organization is a set of shared assumptions that guides behaviors within the organization (<em class="italic">Ravasi, D., &amp; Schultz, M. 2006</em>). That’s why it is hard to change it. Creating PowerPoint slides with values and mission statements might affect the culture but maybe not in the way management intends to do so.</p>
			<p>As an engineer, you might ask yourself why the organization’s culture matters to you. Isn’t that a task for management? However, the culture is the result of the assumptions and the behaviors of every single person in the system – and that means that every single person can change it. As an engineer, you should be aware of your culture and you should speak up if you see that something is wrong. Start doing the right things and telling the right stories.</p>
			<p>Culture is best ingrained into corporate behavior using little quotes and principles that have a deeper meaning. They are easy to remember and encourage people to do the right things. Here are some examples<a id="_idIndexMarker1427"/> you will often hear in companies with great engineering cultures:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">Ask forgiveness, not permission</em>: Encourage people to do the right thing, even if it is against current rules or processes.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">You build it, you run it</em>: Establish end-to-end responsibility and ownership for the things built.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Fail early, fail fast, fail often (or fail fast, roll forward)</em>: Try to fail early and fast instead of making everything 100% bullet-proof.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Embrace failure</em>: Encourage people to experiment and take risks and ensure blameless learnings from failure. <em class="italic">Take responsibility and don’t blame others</em>.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Collaborate, don’t compete</em> or <em class="italic">work together not against</em>: Foster collaboration – across organizational boundaries and also with customers and partners.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Go fix</em>: Encourage people<a id="_idIndexMarker1428"/> to take ownership and fix things instead of just complaining, but you have to ensure that innovation is not suppressed. Make sure people are also empowered to really fix the things they complain about.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Treat servers like cattle, not like pets</em>: Encourage people to <em class="italic">automate everything</em>.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">If it hurts, do it more often</em>: Motivate people to practice things that are hard to build up the skills to accomplish. This phrase is often used in relation to releasing or testing applications.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are just a few examples. More stories and sayings will arise when you transform your culture and establish DevOps.</p>
			<p>A great engineering culture<a id="_idIndexMarker1429"/> is not just the responsibility of management. They have to let it happen and provide the vision but the best culture is then created by the engineers themselves during the transformation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-423"><a id="_idTextAnchor427"/>Data-driven transformation</h1>
			<p>If you want your transformation to succeed, it is critical to measure<a id="_idIndexMarker1430"/> the right metrics and to prove that the transformation really yields better results than the old system. That’s why, in <a href="B17827_01_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Metrics That Matter</em>, I introduced the data points you can collect to know what to optimize first and to achieve small wins that will help you keep everyone motivated to continue with the DevOps transformation. Measuring the right data should always be the start. Optimizing something that is not a constraint<a id="_idIndexMarker1431"/> is a waste of resources and can even have a negative impact. Let’s take adding caching to your application without proof that the operation was slowing down the system in the first place or of how much faster it can be when caching certain data, as an example. Caching introduces complexity and is a source of errors. So, maybe you did not optimize the system at all but made it worse by working based on assumptions. The same is true for your DevOps practices.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-424"><a id="_idTextAnchor428"/>The Theory of Constraints</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Theory of Constraints</strong> (<strong class="bold">TOC</strong>) is based on systems theory and assumes<a id="_idIndexMarker1432"/> that the throughput of a system<a id="_idIndexMarker1433"/> would be infinite if it weren’t for limiting constraints. The TOC tries to maximize the throughput for a system with its current constraints or to optimize the system by reducing these constraints.</p>
			<p>A typical example to explain the theory is a freeway (<em class="italic">Small World 2016</em>). Let’s assume we have a freeway with five lanes but with two construction sites that limit the capacity of two lanes (see <em class="italic">Figure 23.2</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer282" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_23_002.jpg" alt="Figure 23.2 – A freeway with fewer cars, limited by its constraints&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 23.2 – A freeway with fewer cars, limited by its constraints</p>
			<p>The traffic flows through the constraints but this only works up to a certain throughput. If there are too many cars, they will start interacting and slowing each other down, resulting in a traffic jam (see <em class="italic">Figure 23.3</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer283" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_23_003.jpg" alt="Figure 23.3 – If the throughput is too high, it grinds the traffic to a halt&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 23.3 – If the throughput is too high, it grinds the traffic to a halt</p>
			<p>To optimize the traffic<a id="_idIndexMarker1434"/> for a maximal flow, you have<a id="_idIndexMarker1435"/> to limit the traffic to the capacity of the biggest constraint (see <em class="italic">Figure 23.4</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer284" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_23_004.jpg" alt="Figure 23.4 – The maximum flow equals the capacity of the constraint&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 23.4 – The maximum flow equals the capacity of the constraint</p>
			<p>Optimizing anything else other than the biggest constraint will not result in any improvement. Many cities have tried to add lanes before and after a tunnel with basically no improvement of the flow or any reduction of traffic jams. The same is true for your value streams – optimizing anything but the biggest constraint will not result in any improvement.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-425"><a id="_idTextAnchor429"/>Eliminating bottlenecks</h2>
			<p>The TOC provides five focus <a id="_idIndexMarker1436"/>steps for eliminating constraints (see <em class="italic">Figure 23.5</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer285" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_23_005.jpg" alt="Figure 23.5 – The five focus steps for identifying and eliminating constraints&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 23.5 – The five focus steps for identifying and eliminating constraints</p>
			<p>More details of the five steps<a id="_idIndexMarker1437"/> are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identify</strong>: Identify the constraint that limits your current throughput</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Exploit</strong>: Make improvements to the throughput of the constraint</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Synchronize</strong>: Review and subordinate the other activities in the system and make sure they are aligned and support the constraint in an optimal way</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Elevate</strong>: Try to eliminate the constraint and work on the root cause of the problem</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Repeat</strong>: Continuously improve the system by identifying the next constraint that is limiting your current throughput</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Systematically eliminating bottlenecks<a id="_idIndexMarker1438"/> in your flow of work is the key to a successful DevOps transformation!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-426"><a id="_idTextAnchor430"/>DevOps is a journey of continuous improvement</h2>
			<p>DevOps is a journey of continuously<a id="_idIndexMarker1439"/> pushing the boundaries of software delivery performance further by eliminating bottlenecks. In the kickoff to their own DevOps transformation, Microsoft showed some videos of some pit stops from different areas: from Indianapolis in 1950 with 67 seconds to Melbourne in 2013 with about 2.96 seconds. It is a great metaphor for DevOps, continuously improving performance with automation and optimized processes.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users (<em class="italic">Donovan Brown 2015</em>).</p>
			<p>It is an engineering<a id="_idIndexMarker1440"/> culture of research, development, collaboration, learning, and ownership, and it only works if you enact all aspects together. You cannot just pick one aspect of DevOps and implement it without the others. </p>
			<p>You can only improve a system that is about flow if you know the biggest bottleneck and work on that. Trying to optimize other things will not yield any results and is a waste of time and resources. That’s why it is so important to perform a data-driven transformation and measure the right metrics to continuously monitor whether your improvements really yield the expected results. Identify one bottleneck, exploit it, improve it, and repeat.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-427"><a id="_idTextAnchor431"/>Optimizing for value stream-aligned teams</h2>
			<p>I have not talked about any <strong class="bold">DevOps team topologies</strong> (<em class="italic">Matthew Skelton 2013</em>) in this book. I see them used<a id="_idIndexMarker1441"/> often in more IT-driven transformations and it is commonplace to start your transformation journey aligning to one of the topologies and then switching to another model later after achieving a higher DevOps maturity (<em class="italic">Martyn Coupland 2022</em>, <em class="italic">p27</em>). Instead, I focused on <strong class="bold">value stream-aligned</strong> teams (see <a href="B17827_17_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor342"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a>, <em class="italic">Empower Your Teams</em>).</p>
			<p>Your DevOps journey should start with them and optimize everything to enable them to deliver value. This will automatically lead to <strong class="bold">developer-first thinking</strong> (developers being the engineers delivering the value here). If you practice a data-driven transformation and optimize for value by eliminating bottlenecks, topologies such as platform teams or enabling teams will arise. There is no need to plan this upfront. A DevOps organization should be a self-improving system, so once you get to that point, the rest will fall into place nicely.</p>
			<p>A successful data-driven DevOps<a id="_idIndexMarker1442"/> transformation has three major phases (as visualized in <em class="italic">Figure 23.6</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer286" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17827_23_006_new.jpg" alt="Figure 23.6 – The phases of data-driven DevOps transformation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 23.6 – The phases of data-driven DevOps transformation</p>
			<p>More details of the phases are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Metrics</strong>: Start by defining metrics<a id="_idIndexMarker1443"/> and gathering data (see <em class="italic">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Metrics That Matter</em>).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tooling decisions</strong>: You will have to make some basic<a id="_idIndexMarker1444"/> tooling decisions. In this book, I assume <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> is the DevOps platform<a id="_idIndexMarker1445"/>, but there will be more decisions to make regarding cloud usage and alignment to current governance processes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">People, process, and culture</strong>: Carefully pick your pilot teams<a id="_idIndexMarker1446"/> and bring them to the new platform by transforming their way of working to <strong class="bold">lean management</strong> and <strong class="bold">higher collaboration</strong>. Teach and enable them to adopt <strong class="bold">engineering DevOps practices</strong> such as automation and trunk-based development and enable them to <strong class="bold">release</strong> frequently <strong class="bold">with confidence</strong>. The metrics should improve rapidly. These are the quick <a id="_idIndexMarker1447"/>wins you need to keep everyone motivated.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scale and optimize</strong>: With the pilot teams successful, you can start<a id="_idIndexMarker1448"/> to scale by creating more teams that work on the new platform with the new processes and tools. This is also the time when you start optimizing more capabilities, such as <strong class="bold">software architecture</strong> and <strong class="bold">lean product management</strong> techniques. Take one bottleneck at a time, always observing whether the metrics confirm the desired results.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Since DevOps is a journey and not a goal, this phase basically never ends. You may adjust the metrics after some time, you will optimize team size and autonomy, but the optimization does not end. The results just get smaller and smaller as you are already on a higher level.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">DevOps vision</strong>: The heart of the transformation throughout<a id="_idIndexMarker1449"/> all phases is a strong vision that explains the <em class="italic">WHY</em>? and establishes a sense of urgency. Ensure that you have a good communication and change management strategy in place. There is resistance to any change and you have to address fear and communicate the <em class="italic">WHY</em>?, <em class="italic">HOW</em>?, and <em class="italic">WHAT</em>? of the process and the many success stories you gather along the way to motivate everyone to move forward.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-428"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>To remain competitive, companies cannot just solve a customer’s problem. They need to deliver products and services that delight their customers and they must be able to engage with the market and respond fast to changing demands. This makes every company today a software company. If your company will not be able to transform, it will probably be out of business in a few years.</p>
			<p>Many transformations fail but many are successful and these companies prove that even big enterprises or companies in highly regulated environments are able to transform and adopt DevOps.</p>
			<p>With GitHub, you have one of the best products on the market, which is loved by more than 73 million developers worldwide, by all big open source communities, and by more than 84% of the Fortune 500 companies. This means less training, quicker onboarding, and high developer satisfaction, which leads to better talent attraction and retention. But the open source communities also provide you with building blocks for your applications, for tooling, for your pipeline, and they will also power the templates for your process templates. Leveraging the power of the community will help you to accelerate and GitHub gives you the opportunity to pay the community back by contributing yourself or by sponsoring the projects that you rely on.</p>
			<p>I hope this book helps as a practical guide to a successful DevOps transformation using the power of GitHub. There is nothing more rewarding for me than seeing engineers having fun working on solving real engineering problems in a DevOps culture, instead of fighting bugs in production or estimating requirements they think are stupid.</p>
