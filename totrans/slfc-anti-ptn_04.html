    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.2">
     The things that go wrong in the data layer tend to affect everything in the layers above, so if you fall into any of these anti-patterns, consequences will be serious for all aspects of your future configuration, integration, and

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.2">
     Not that they are unimportant elsewhere, but if you get your data layer wrong, then it is very hard to get everything
