			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Measuring the Process and Solution</h1>
			<p>We measure to see how far our efforts have progressed. This measurement has multiple dimensions. We examine whether we are achieving Lean flow and delivering work properly. Following that, we deploy the work to see if the changes work in the environment and whether the environment is safe. Finally, we gauge whether the changes created add value and are worthy of <span class="No-Break">continued development.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at the measurements used to answer the questions posed above. We will look at metrics to determine <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Whether we are on track to deliver <span class="No-Break">the solution</span></li>
				<li>The health of our environments before and after our solution <span class="No-Break">is delivered</span></li>
				<li>Whether our solution is delivering on <span class="No-Break">hypothesized value</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Measuring solution delivery</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B18756_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Leveraging</em> <em class="italic">Lean Flow to Keep the Work Moving</em>, we looked at practices to establish <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>and maintain Lean flow. We need metrics to evaluate whether we have achieved that Lean flow and whether we can be predictable in <span class="No-Break">our commitments.</span></p>
			<p>Common metrics to evaluate Lean flow are outlined in the <span class="No-Break">following list:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Cycle time</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">WIP</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Throughput</span></li>
				<li>Blockers or bottlenecks in <span class="No-Break">the process</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A useful tool to obtain these metrics is a cumulative flow diagram. We will take a close look at a cumulative flow diagram to find <span class="No-Break">these metrics.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Cycle time</h2>
			<p>For a value stream, cycle time is the time it takes for a piece of work to be delivered after it <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>has been accepted and goes through the entire <span class="No-Break">development process.</span></p>
			<p>We saw in <a href="B18756_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Leveraging</em> <em class="italic">Lean Flow to Keep the Work Moving</em>, the many factors that can affect cycle time. These factors included too much WIP, large batch sizes, high utilization, <span class="No-Break">and variability.</span></p>
			<p>Another factor that can affect cycle time is if there is waste in the development process. This waste may come in the form of delays or <em class="italic">wait times</em> as work gets handed off from one phase to <span class="No-Break">the next.</span></p>
			<p>Regular measurement of cycle time allows us to see how long it takes for a value stream to deliver work. Increases in cycle time can allow us to determine if the root cause is one of the factors mentioned. Once determined, corrective steps can be taken to put cycle time back to its previous length <span class="No-Break">of time.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Lead time</h2>
			<p>Lead time <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>and cycle time are frequently confused with each other. The big difference between them is the perspective: while lead time is from the customer’s perspective, cycle time is from the perspective of the value stream and is an <span class="No-Break">internal metric.</span></p>
			<p>Lead time is the length of time a customer waits for delivery of an item of work after a request for that work. As shown in the following diagram, lead time is made up of cycle time as well as any <em class="italic">wait time</em> for the value stream to accept and start <span class="No-Break">the work.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer056" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_05_01.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – Illustration of cycle time and lead time"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1 – Illustration of cycle time and lead time</p>
			<p>From the preceding illustration, we can improve two times to improve the lead time. We could improve the wait time or we could improve the cycle time. Most organizations strive to improve cycle times with the added benefit of improving the <span class="No-Break">lead time.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>WIP</h2>
			<p>By now, we <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>should be familiar with <strong class="bold">WIP</strong> or <strong class="bold">Work in Progress/Process</strong> as the work that a value stream has started but not finished. We have seen the ill effects and consequences of too <span class="No-Break">much WIP.</span></p>
			<p>WIP is <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>visible on the Kanban board shown in the <span class="No-Break">following illustration.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_05_02.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – Kanban board with WIP highlighted"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2 – Kanban board with WIP highlighted</p>
			<p>In the preceding example, we can count the items and determine our WIP <span class="No-Break">is six.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Throughput</h2>
			<p>Up to <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>this point, we have looked at metrics that are units, either of time or quantity. Throughput is the only metric we look at that is basically a rate. In other words, how much work is accomplished in a given unit <span class="No-Break">of time.</span></p>
			<p>Throughput is basically the number of units of work completed in a set period of time. Scrum practitioners know of this metric as velocity: the sum total of story points for stories <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>completed in a sprint (a fixed period of time; often two weeks). Other Agile methodologies look at other units of work (stories, features, etc.) delivered per standard unit of time (<span class="No-Break">week, month).</span></p>
			<p>We can see that cycle time has an inverse relationship with throughput for a value stream. The greater the throughput, the shorter the <span class="No-Break">cycle time.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Blockers and bottlenecks</h2>
			<p>To ensure Lean flow, we need to find and resolve those impediments that are preventing <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>that flow from occurring. These may be temporary or systemic blocks preventing one or more pieces of work from progressing through <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></p>
			<p>Vigilance on these blockers may require daily checks to see if the blockage is still occurring and escalation if resolving the block has not occurred for <span class="No-Break">several days.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Measuring with cumulative flow diagrams</h2>
			<p>A cumulative <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>flow diagram is an easy way to examine cycle time, lead time, throughput, and WIP. You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>inspect and find bottlenecks in <span class="No-Break">your process.</span></p>
			<p>The cumulative flow diagram is a graph of the history of work that the value stream works through over time. The <em class="italic">x</em> axis of the cumulative flow diagram refers to time. The <em class="italic">y</em> axis refers to the count of work. Each band in the cumulative flow diagram refers to a step in the workflow that is derived from columns on a Kanban board. An example cumulative flow <span class="No-Break">diagram follows.</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.3 – Cumulative flow diagram</p>
			<p>In general, we should see the bands move upward and grow from left to right. The entrance <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>and exit lines for a band that represents a process step in the workflow should be roughly parallel in a situation where flow occurs. If the <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>entrance and exit lines grow apart, creating a large growing area, that’s an indicator that a bottleneck exists in that part of the process. We can see such a bottleneck in the <span class="No-Break">following diagram.</span></p>

			<p>Let’s take a look at how we can use the cumulative flow diagram to measure cycle time, WIP, <span class="No-Break">and throughput.</span></p>
			<h3>Measuring WIP with the cumulative flow diagram</h3>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>measure the WIP that a value <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>stream has at a given point in time, do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start at the point where the boundary between the band corresponding to the Backlog or <strong class="bold">To Do</strong> column and the band corresponding to the first <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong> column resides. In our example, this is the boundary between the <strong class="bold">To Do</strong> band and the <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong> band. We want to look at only the work that has started and, thus, beyond the <strong class="bold">To </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Do</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> state.</span></li>
				<li>Make a note of how many units of work <span class="No-Break">that is.</span></li>
				<li>Draw a vertical line down through the other bands until you reach the boundary between the band representing the last <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong> column and the band representing the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> column. In our example, we draw the line through the <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong> band and the <strong class="bold">IN REVIEW</strong> band. Make a note of how many units of work <span class="No-Break">that is.</span></li>
				<li>Subtract the second number from the <span class="No-Break">first number.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following diagram illustrates the <span class="No-Break">method described.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_05_05.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – Calculation of WIP"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – Calculation of WIP</p>
			<p>Note <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>that you can use the same <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>method on a smaller scale to find the number of <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong> issues in a single column at a point in time by looking at the two lines that form the band for the column <span class="No-Break">of interest.</span></p>
			<h3>Measuring cycle time with the cumulative flow diagram</h3>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>measure cycle time, do <span class="No-Break">the </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker368"/></span><span class="No-Break">following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Find and mark a spot when an issue has moved from the band representing the <strong class="bold">To Do</strong> or Backlog column and note <span class="No-Break">its date.</span></li>
				<li>Draw a horizontal line until you reach the spot where it touches the band representing the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> column. Mark the <span class="No-Break">second date.</span></li>
				<li>Subtract <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>the first date <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>from the second, and you will get a measure of the cycle time for <span class="No-Break">one issue.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_05_06.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – Cycle time calculation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.6 – Cycle time calculation</p>
			<p>The steps are illustrated in the <span class="No-Break">preceding diagram.</span></p>
			<h3>Measuring throughput with the cumulative flow diagram</h3>
			<p>Throughput <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>on a cumulative <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>flow diagram is done by finding a line and determining <span class="No-Break">its slope:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Mark one point of the line and make a note of the date and number <span class="No-Break">of issues.</span></li>
				<li>On a higher point on the line, make a note of the date and number <span class="No-Break">of issues.</span></li>
				<li>The numerator will be the number of issues on the second point minus the number of issues on the <span class="No-Break">first point.</span></li>
				<li>The denominator will be the period of time between the <span class="No-Break">two points.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>An example of this calculation is shown in the <span class="No-Break">following example.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer062" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_05_07.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – Throughput calculation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.7 – Throughput calculation</p>
			<p>Note <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>that areas of no throughput will appear as <span class="No-Break">horizontal lines.</span></p>
			<p>So, for <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>our examples, we have found the <span class="No-Break">following measurements:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>On January 22, our WIP was <span class="No-Break">six issues</span></li>
				<li>Our cycle time for one issue was <span class="No-Break">one month</span></li>
				<li>Our throughput for issues moving from <strong class="bold">IN REVIEW</strong> to <strong class="bold">Done</strong> <span class="No-Break">was 0.06/day</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Having evaluated the measurements taken to ensure Lean flow and timely delivery of solutions, we need to take a closer look at ensuring that quality is present during deployment and before release. To do this, let’s look at the important measurements to capture from the staging and <span class="No-Break">production environments.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Looking at full stack telemetry</h1>
			<p>We now turn our attention from the process of developing the product to the product itself. Throughout the development process, we ran testing in our CI/CD pipeline. The passing of <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>those tests is an indication that the product is working as intended. Now, as the product is deployed in multiple environments, we want to ensure proper operation. To do this, we monitor performance in <span class="No-Break">those environments.</span></p>
			<p>Monitoring is the act of measuring our environment. We measure or capture the following three key types <span class="No-Break">of data:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logs</strong>: Logs are <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>an indication that a notable event has occurred. These events may be classified to determine <span class="No-Break">their severity.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Traces</strong>: Traces show <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>the path inside an application and the messages sent by the application for a given business transaction. Timing information may also be included. The information from traces helps determine the correct function and performance <span class="No-Break">when troubleshooting.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Metrics</strong>: Metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>are indicators of the current state of the system and its components. Periodic measurements are taken to determine good or bad trends <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We collect these types of data artifacts through monitoring to answer the following questions about the environment that contains the system and <span class="No-Break">its components:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: Are <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>security vulnerabilities present? Has the system <span class="No-Break">been hacked?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance</strong>: Is the <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>system performing properly? Are transactions following the <span class="No-Break">expected paths?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reliability</strong>: Is the <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>system up and performing well? </li>
			</ul>
			<p>To answer these questions, monitoring takes measurements from multiple perspectives. A few <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>of the key <span class="No-Break">perspectives follow:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Application <span class="No-Break">performance monitoring</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Infrastructure monitoring</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Log management</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Network monitoring</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Observability</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s take a closer look at these elements of full <span class="No-Break">stack telemetry.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Application performance monitoring</h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>looking to see if an application <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>is performing adequately in an environment, there are usually two perspectives that are taken <span class="No-Break">into account:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>How do users perceive the performance of the application? This may be seen as user load or <span class="No-Break">response times.</span></li>
				<li>How much of our resources (e.g., allocated memory) is the application using? This is typically measured as a change in capacity from a previous state <span class="No-Break">or configuration.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In 2010, Gartner looked at expanding these sets of measures into five dimensions called the <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>APM Conceptual Framework. These dimensions are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>End user experience (e.g., <span class="No-Break">response times)</span></li>
				<li>Runtime application architecture (e.g., garbage <span class="No-Break">collection events)</span></li>
				<li>Business transactions </li>
				<li>Middleware components (e.g., database reads <span class="No-Break">and writes)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Application analytics</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Many of the applications that have their performance measured by application performance monitoring are web-based applications with a web browser or mobile app user interface. The reason for this is the easy collection of metrics that span the <span class="No-Break">five dimensions.</span></p>
			<p>Many monitoring tools, especially ones detailed in <a href="B18756_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor066"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Automation for Efficiency and Quality</em>, have features that touch all five of <span class="No-Break">these dimensions.</span></p>
			<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>growing popularity of <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>containers and microservices, application performance monitoring has had to look at creating accurate measurements of performance within a container or microservice. Because of this, there is some overlap between application performance monitoring and <span class="No-Break">infrastructure monitoring.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Infrastructure monitoring</h2>
			<p>Infrastructure <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>monitoring is used to measure the resources <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>of the entire system or environment. This is usually identified in terms of the <span class="No-Break">following utilizations:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">CPU utilization</span></li>
				<li>Memory (<span class="No-Break">RAM) utilization</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Storage availability</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Historically, infrastructure monitoring was important for on-premises equipment, such as <em class="italic">bare-metal</em> servers. With the growth of cloud environments, infrastructure monitoring tools need to measure dynamically allocated resources that will be instantaneously created and destroyed depending <span class="No-Break">on need.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Network monitoring</h2>
			<p>Network <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>monitoring measures the performance <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>of the organization’s network to discover slow performance or outage situations. Generally, network monitoring systems keep track of the <span class="No-Break">following areas:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Availability of network resources (e.g., connection uptime, <span class="No-Break">connection speed)</span></li>
				<li>Networking <span class="No-Break">hardware status</span></li>
				<li>Network <span class="No-Break">interface state</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A growing <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>area for network monitoring is ensuring that security <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>in terms of integrity, accessibility, and privacy is maintained. Some network defenses to ensure security include <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/><span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Network Access </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Control</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">NAC</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Firewalls</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Antivirus/anti-malware software</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Virtual Private </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Networks</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">VPNs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Email </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker395"/></span><span class="No-Break">security</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Application security</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Cloud security</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Log management</h2>
			<p>All the <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>tools that perform monitoring will create logs of all activities and measurements, from critical alerts to informational notices. Log management <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>collects these events as well as performing the <span class="No-Break">following activities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Aggregation into a <span class="No-Break">central location</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Storage</span></li>
				<li>Log rotation <span class="No-Break">and disposal</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Analysis</span></li>
				<li>Search <span class="No-Break">and reporting</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Properly managed logs are needed both during the development process and afterward for several purposes. These include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Determining whether <span class="No-Break">tests pass</span></li>
				<li>Troubleshooting application and <span class="No-Break">environment failures</span></li>
				<li>Evaluating <span class="No-Break">customer feedback</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While collecting the logs, traces, and metrics is important, the ability to sift through all that data <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>when something goes wrong is also important. For that, we turn <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>to observability. Let’s discuss what to do with that <span class="No-Break">monitoring information.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Observability</h2>
			<p>The mountain <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>of data created by collecting logs, traces, and <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>metrics through monitoring now introduces the following <span class="No-Break">new questions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>When something wrong occurs, can I quickly find the data in the logs, traces, and metrics to understand the root cause and find <span class="No-Break">a solution?</span></li>
				<li>Can I use the data I’ve collected in logs, traces, and metrics to predict when problems may occur and try to prevent them <span class="No-Break">from occurring?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Observability looks to answer these questions by shifting from collecting the data to understanding the data itself to identify its current state. Doing so moves beyond just monitoring to include the <span class="No-Break">following activities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Analysis of logs, traces, <span class="No-Break">and metrics</span></li>
				<li>Looking for correlation between the logs, traces, metrics, and specific events, such <span class="No-Break">as outages</span></li>
				<li>Visualization and exploration of data <span class="No-Break">through dashboards</span></li>
				<li>Alerts and notifications when <span class="No-Break">problems occur</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Observability helps enforce a higher level of systems thinking by allowing teams to understand the cause and effect the changes have on the environment. By understanding what causes changes beneficial to the environment, teams can incorporate the correct changes for <span class="No-Break">better outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>Having ensured that the solution is of sufficient quality, we come upon the greater test: does the solution developed provide sufficient value to our customers to the point that they will love it? To evaluate this, we need to take measurements of outcome-based metrics. This is the topic of the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Measuring the value proposition</h1>
			<p>It’s difficult to apply an objective measurement to a subjective quality such as value. What we <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>can do is measure actions taken by our customer or feedback that our customer has given in terms of survey responses or thoughts during specific events such <span class="No-Break">as reviews.</span></p>
			<p>When looking at the measurements for value, some metrics may be collected too late to allow a <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>value <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>stream to know when to pivot. Examples of this include <strong class="bold">Profit &amp; Loss</strong> (<strong class="bold">P&amp;L</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Return on Investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">RoI</strong>). So, other metrics that can act as leading indicators are needed. The practice <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>of collecting leading indicators to allow pivots or continued development is called <em class="italic">innovation accounting</em> by Eric Ries in his book, <em class="italic">The </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Lean Startup</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>The Innovation Accounting framework</h2>
			<p>Ries describes <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>the method of hypothesizing <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>and learning as the <strong class="bold">Innovation Accounting</strong> framework. In this framework, teams work to establish hypotheses of what the customer wants, develop those hypotheses, and then measure and determine further actions. This is done in a three-phase cycle in which the following <span class="No-Break">is done:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Look at the present situation and establish a baseline hypothesis through a <strong class="bold">Minimum Viable Product</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>) or development of <em class="italic">just enough</em> of a product <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>or its features to bring to a customer and obtain feedback as validation of <span class="No-Break">the hypothesis.</span></li>
				<li>Based on metrics, make small adjustments to <span class="No-Break">the MVP.</span></li>
				<li>If the metrics indicate success, continue the refinement of the MVP. If metrics tell you otherwise, pivot to <span class="No-Break">something new.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the Innovation Accounting framework, the metrics gathered must be carefully chosen, so they <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>don’t end up being <strong class="bold">vanity metrics</strong>. Vanity metrics tell a good story but provide no meaningful insights. To avoid a metric from falling into the vanity metric category, Ries recommends they have the following <span class="No-Break">three qualities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Actionable</strong>: Does the <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>metric show clear cause and effect? In other words, could you replicate the results by performing the <span class="No-Break">same actions?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accessible</strong>: Does <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>everyone on the value stream have access to the same data, and is that data understood <span class="No-Break">by all?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Auditable</strong>: Is there <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>credibility to <span class="No-Break">the report?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Metrics that <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>work with Innovation Accounting will depend on the end product developed by the value stream and customer interaction with the product. We will look at a few of the leading metric collections used to <span class="No-Break">measure value.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Pirate metrics</h2>
			<p>For many <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>products available and sold to end user <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>customers, such as <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) or web-based products, <em class="italic">pirate</em> metrics offer the best guidance on whether development and marketing efforts are <span class="No-Break">bearing fruit.</span></p>
			<p>Pirate metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>were devised by Dave McClure in 2007. They get their name from the acronym formed when we look at the first letter of the five phases (<strong class="bold">AARRR</strong>), which sounds like the noise a pirate makes. These phases are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Acquisition</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Activation</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Retention</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Referral</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Revenue</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s take a close look at <span class="No-Break">each phase.</span></p>
			<h3>Acquisition</h3>
			<p>In this phase, metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>look to determine the number of new visitors <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>to the product. The metrics here are used to <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>capture the effectiveness of the following methods to attract <span class="No-Break">new users.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Search Engine </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Optimization</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">SEO</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Social media</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Advertising</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Marketing campaigns</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Activation</h3>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>activation phase, we look to see how many new users <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>want to become more engaged after first encountering the product or website. Metrics here look at the following user actions as indications that new users are beyond the acquisition phase and into <span class="No-Break">this phase:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visiting additional pages after the <span class="No-Break">landing page</span></li>
				<li>Looking at or playing with additional <span class="No-Break">product features</span></li>
				<li>Spending more time on <span class="No-Break">the website</span></li>
				<li>Signing up for the <span class="No-Break">newsletter/email list</span></li>
				<li>Signing up for a <span class="No-Break">free trial</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Results of tests recording user behavior, such as A/B tests, are used to create these types <span class="No-Break">of metrics.</span></p>
			<h3>Retention</h3>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>phase, we look to see how long we can keep users after their <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>first encounter. We want to measure whether the following <span class="No-Break">things occur:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Return visits to <span class="No-Break">the website</span></li>
				<li>Opening <span class="No-Break">email newsletters</span></li>
				<li>Repeated use of the product over a given period of time (often the <span class="No-Break">first month)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Often, these metrics measure the effectiveness of marketing emails <span class="No-Break">and campaigns.</span></p>
			<h3>Referral</h3>
			<p>This phase <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>looks to see if the established customer spreads <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>the word to friends or coworkers. The metrics to determine entry into this phase include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Number of referrals who enter the <span class="No-Break">acquisition phase</span></li>
				<li>Number of referrals who enter the <span class="No-Break">activation phase</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Revenue</h3>
			<p>Finally, this phase <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>looks at those customers that have reached a higher level <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>and purchased enhanced product features or website content. We look to see which customers do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pay the <span class="No-Break">minimum revenue</span></li>
				<li>Pay enough revenue for marketing efforts to <em class="italic">break even</em> throughout <span class="No-Break">all phases</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>The Google HEART framework</h2>
			<p>The HEART <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>framework was devised by Kerry Rodden, Hilary <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>Hutchinson, and Xin Fu at Google. It was developed <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>to gauge the effectiveness of <strong class="bold">User Experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>) design for the large-scale web applications offered <span class="No-Break">by Google.</span></p>
			<p>The framework <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>has team members evaluate the <span class="No-Break">following dimensions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Happiness</strong>: These are typically subjective measures such as user satisfaction, perceived ease of use, and likelihood <span class="No-Break">to recommend.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Engagement</strong>: This tracks how involved the user is with the product and <span class="No-Break">its features.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adoption</strong>: This tracks the number of new users in a given <span class="No-Break">time period.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Retention</strong>: This tracks how many users in a given time period are still engaged at a later <span class="No-Break">time period.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Task success</strong>: This measures the overall usability of the product or individual feature in question. Can a user accomplish the desired outcome using the product <span class="No-Break">or feature?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>For each <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>dimension, the team looks at setting three qualities. These qualities are outlined in the <span class="No-Break">following list:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Goals or objectives</strong>: What is the goal for the product <span class="No-Break">or feature?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Signals</strong>: How do we know that we achieved the goal <span class="No-Break">or objective?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Metrics</strong>: What metrics can we collect to get the signals <span class="No-Break">we want?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Teams will <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>often take the dimensions <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>and qualities and arrange them in a table. An example of this is in the <span class="No-Break">following diagram.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 5.1 – Google HEART framework</p>
			<p>The next metrics framework looks for alignment between customer desires and organization efforts. Let’s look at this <span class="No-Break">framework now.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Fit for Purpose metrics</h2>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Fit for Purpose: How Modern Businesses Find, Satisfy, &amp; Keep Customers</em>, authors <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>David J. Anderson and Alexei Zheglov <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>describe the <strong class="bold">Fit for Purpose</strong> (<strong class="bold">F4P</strong>) framework, a way of aligning customer needs (<em class="italic">purpose</em>) with the products and solutions an organization may <span class="No-Break">offer (</span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">fit</em></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>Anderson and Zheglov identify four classifications of metrics that organizations typically collect and show where they fit in the framework. The classifications are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Fitness criteria</span></li>
				<li>General <span class="No-Break">health indicators</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Improvement drivers</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Vanity metrics</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s look at each <span class="No-Break">category now.</span></p>
			<h3>Fitness criteria</h3>
			<p>Fitness criteria <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>describe the metrics your customer will use to determine whether your product or solution fits their needs or purpose. These fitness criteria will be based on the <span class="No-Break">following dimensions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Design</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Implementation</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Service delivery</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Customers will evaluate fitness criteria using thresholds. The first is a minimum acceptance level, below which they will decide the product or service does not meet their need. The second threshold is for exceptional service or for situations where the product in all three dimensions <span class="No-Break">exceeds expectations.</span></p>
			<p>Many organizations start with these metrics as fitness criteria until they find out more about the customer or <span class="No-Break">market segment:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lead time and <span class="No-Break">its predictability.</span></li>
				<li>Quality and <span class="No-Break">its predictability.</span></li>
				<li>Safety, including compliance with necessary laws and standards if in a <span class="No-Break">regulated industry.</span></li>
				<li>Price. Note that this is often not an independent variable. In other words, the price may be sacrificed for higher expectations of the other <span class="No-Break">fitness criteria.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Customer <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>input into their fitness criteria is often acquired through F4P surveys, which ask customers what three purposes they were seeking, how well the product or service met those purposes, and any <span class="No-Break">other notes.</span></p>
			<h3>General health indicators</h3>
			<p>General health indicators are metrics internal to the organization. They can be used to determine <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>suitability to improve one or more of the dimensions (design, implementation, service journey) that customers use to align an organization’s fit to their purpose. Although these are important metrics and should be collected and analyzed, they are secondary to fitness criteria in determining whether value has been created to the point that customers will select <span class="No-Break">the product.</span></p>
			<p>Examples of general health indicators include cycle time for a value stream, velocity for a Scrum team, and mean time to restore/recover for an <span class="No-Break">operations team.</span></p>
			<h3>Improvement drivers</h3>
			<p>Improvement drivers are metrics used by organizations for the purpose of improvement. They are the measurement that an organization is adopting a specific behavior. There <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>is usually a target associated with them, and when that target is achieved, that metric should be changed to a general <span class="No-Break">health indicator.</span></p>
			<p>An example of an improvement driver could be the number of tests automated. This metric would be there to encourage an emphasis on <span class="No-Break">test automation.</span></p>
			<h3>Vanity metrics</h3>
			<p>We’ve discussed vanity metrics before when talking about Innovation Accounting. Many organizations do collect vanity metrics, and they do provide an emotional boost. But like sugary snacks <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>or junk food with their <em class="italic">empty calories</em>, these metrics offer no real insight into whether an organization’s actions are bringing the true value that a <span class="No-Break">customer wants.</span></p>
			<p>An example of this is the total number of website visits that an organization’s website generates. Without diving deeper into details, this is a number that will always go up and doesn’t relate to any efforts the organization is making in marketing <span class="No-Break">or SEO.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Net promoter score</h2>
			<p>Net promoter score is a common metric used in customer support. This usually takes the form <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>of a single survey question: how likely are you to recommend the product or service to a friend or colleague? This question is accompanied by a range of responses from 1-10. The users then divide the respondents into the following categories based on <span class="No-Break">their response:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Promoters (9-10)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Passives (7-8)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Detractors (1-6)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The score is then calculated by looking at the percentage of promoters and detractors and subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. This percentage is then expressed as <span class="No-Break">an integer.</span></p>
			<p>We have now completed our exploration of popular metrics frameworks used to measure the value we deliver to our customers. Most of these involve direct contact with the customer and it is beneficial if this contact is made on a <span class="No-Break">frequent basis.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at the measurements we make during both the development process and afterward. We found that we had to make measurements in three areas to determine whether our value stream was optimized and working <span class="No-Break">toward value.</span></p>
			<p>The first area examined using measurement was the teams and value stream to see if they were working toward optimizing flow. Measurements such as cycle time, lead time, WIP, and throughput were defined and determined using a cumulative <span class="No-Break">flow diagram.</span></p>
			<p>The second area measured the environments where the applications reside. Tools are available to ensure the proper functioning of the application and the environmental resources, such as the infrastructure, including storage <span class="No-Break">and networks.</span></p>
			<p>The third area measured the value provided by the solution. Metric frameworks, such as pirate metrics (AARRR), the Google HEART framework, and F4P metrics, look at the customer actions and thoughts to determine whether the solution developed works with customer expectations to <span class="No-Break">provide value.</span></p>
			<p>In our next chapter, we’ll finish our examination of CALMR by taking a look at <em class="italic">Recovery</em>. We will look at the methods value streams will use to mitigate the risk of a failure in production and the methods they use to quickly resolve issues in production if <span class="No-Break">they happen.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Questions</h1>
