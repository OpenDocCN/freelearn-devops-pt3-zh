<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Welcome to the first chapter! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">In this book, you will learn the fundamentals of DevOps, its impact on the industry, and how to apply it to modern data </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">persistence technologies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">When I first encountered the term </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">DevOps</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> years ago, I initially saw it as a way to grant development teams unrestricted access to production environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">This made me nervous, especially because there seemed to be a lack of clear accountability at that time, making the move toward DevOps </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">appear risky.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">At the time (around 2010), the roles of developers and operations were divided by a very strict line. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Developers could gain read-only privileges, but that’s about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">What I did not see back then was that this was the first step in blurring the lines between development and operation teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">We already had many siloed teams pointing fingers at one another. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.5">This made the work slow, segmented, and frustrating. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.6">I was worried this would just increase complexity and cause an even greater challenge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.7">Luckily, today’s world of DevOps is very different, and we can all improve it together </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">even further!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">There are no more dividing lines between the development and operations teams – they are one team with a common objective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">This improves quality, speed, and agility! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">This also means that traditional roles such as database admin are changing as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4">We now have </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">site reliability engineers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">SREs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">) or DevOps engineers who are experts at using databases and able to perform operational and development tasks alike. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Blurring the line means you increase the responsibilities, and in a high-performing DevOps team, this means you are responsible for everything from end to end. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">Modern tooling and orchestration frameworks can help you do way more than ever before, but it’s a very different landscape than it was many </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">years ago.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">This book will introduce you to this amazing new world, walk you through the journey that leads us to this ever-changing world of DevOps today, and give some indications as to where we might </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">go next.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">By the end of this book, you will be able to not only demonstrate your theoretical knowledge but also design, build, and operate complex systems with a heavy focus on data </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">persistence technologies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">DevOps and data persistence technologies have a love-hate relationship, which makes this topic even </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">more interesting.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">In this chapter, we will take a deep dive into the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">following topics:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Have you ever </span><a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">wondered how much data we generate every single day? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Or the effort required to store and access your data on demand? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">What about the infrastructure or the services required to make all of this happen? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">Not to mention the engineering effort put in to make all of this happen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.5">If you have, you are in the right place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.6">These questions inspired me to dive deep into the realms of DevOps and SRE and inspired the creation of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">this book.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Technology impacts almost every aspect of our lives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">We are more connected than ever, with access to more information and services than we even realize. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">It’s not just our computers, phones, or tablets that are connected to the internet, but our cars, cameras, watches, televisions, speakers, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">The more digital native we become, the bigger our digital </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">footprint grows.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">A digital footprint, also known as a digital shadow, is a collection of data that represents an individual’s interactions and activities across digital platforms and the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">This data can be categorized as either </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">passive</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">, where it’s generated without direct interaction – such as browsing history – or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">active</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">, resulting from deliberate online actions such as social media posts or emails. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Your digital footprint serves as an online record of your digital presence, and it can have lasting implications for your privacy </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">and reputation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">As of 2022, researchers estimate that out of 8 billion people (the world’s population as of 2022), approximately 5 billion utilize the internet daily. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Compared to the 2 billion that was measured in 2012, this is a 250% increase over 10 years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">This is an incredible increase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">See the following figure </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">for reference:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Each person who has a digital presence generates digital footprints in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">two ways.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">The first is actively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">When </span><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">you browse a website, upload a picture, send an email, or make a video call, you generate data that will be utilized and stored for some time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">The other, less obvious way is passive data generation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">If you, like me, utilize digital services with push notifications on or have GPS enabled on your phone with a timeline, for example, you are generating data every minute of the day – even if you do not use these services actively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.4">Prime examples can be any </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Internet of Things</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">IoT</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">) devices, something</span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> such as an internet-enabled security camera – even if you are not actively using it, it’s still generating data and constantly uploading it to your service provider for safekeeping. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">IoT devices are the secondary source of data generators right after us active internet surfers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">Researchers estimate that approximately 13 billion IoT devices are being connected and in daily use as of 2022, with the expectation that this figure will become close to 30 billion by the end of 2030. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.4">See the following figure </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">for reference:</span></span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Figure 1.2 – Connected IoT devices (in the billions)</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Combining the 5 billion active internet users with the 13 billion connected IoT devices, it is easy to guess that our combined digital footprint must be ginormous. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Yet trying to guess the exact number is much harder than you might think. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">Give it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">a try.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">As of 2023, it is estimated that we generate approximately 3.5 exabytes of data every single day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">This is about 1 exabyte more than what was estimated in 2021. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">To help visualize how much data we are talking about, let me try to put this into perspective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.4">Let’s say you have a notebook (or one of the latest phones) with 1 TB of storage capacity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.5">If you were</span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1"> to use this 1 TB storage to store all this information, it would be full in less than 0.025 seconds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">An alternative way to think about it is that we can fill 3,670,016 devices with 1 TB storage within </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">24 hours.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">How do we generate data today?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Well, for starters, we collectively </span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">send approximately 333.2 billion emails per day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">This means that more than 3.5 million emails are sent per second. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">We also make over 0.5 billion hours of video calls, stream more than 200 million hours of media content, and share more than 5 billion videos and photos every </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">single day.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">So, yes, that’s a lot of us armed with many devices (on average, one active internet user had about 2.6 IoT devices in 2022) generating an unbelievable amount of data every single day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">But the challenge does not stop at the amount of data alone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">The speed and reliability of interacting with it are just as important as, if not more important than, the storage itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">Have you ever searched for one of your photos to show someone, but it was slow and took forever to find, so you gave up? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.5">We have all been there, but can you remember just how much time after doing this that you decided to abandon </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">your search?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">As technology advances, we gain quicker access to information and multitask more efficiently, which may be contributing to a gradual decline in our attention spans. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">Research shows that in 2000, the average attention span was 12 seconds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Since then, significant technological milestones have occurred: the advent of the iPhone, YouTube, various generations of mobile networks, Wikipedia, and Spotify, to name a few. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">Internet speed has also soared, moving from an average of 127 kilobits per second in 2000 to 4.4 Mbps by 2010, and hitting an average of 50.8 Mbps by 2020 – with some areas experiencing speeds well over 200 </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Mbps today.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">As the digital landscape </span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">accelerates, so do our expectations, resulting in further erosion of our attention spans. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">By 2015, that 12-second average had fallen to just 8.25 seconds and dropped slightly below 8 seconds </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">by 2022.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Why speed matters</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">If you consider your</span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1"> attention span the full amount of time you would consider spending to complete a simple task, such as showing photos or videos to a friend, this means searching for it is just a small percentage of your total time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Let’s say you are using a type of cloud service to search for your photo or video. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">What would you consider to be an acceptable amount of time between you hitting </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">search</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> and receiving </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">your content?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">I still remember the time when “buffering” was a given thing, but if you see something similar today, you would find it unacceptable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">According to multiple studies, the ideal load time for “average content,” such as photos or videos, is somewhere between 1 and 2 seconds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than three seconds to load. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.4">A further two-second delay in load time results in abandonment rates of up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">to 87%.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">This shows us that storing our data is not enough – making it accessible reliably and with blazing speed is not</span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1"> only nice to have but an absolute necessity in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">today’s world.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Data management strategies</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">There are many </span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">strategies out there, and we will need to use most of them to meet and hopefully exceed our customers’ expectations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Reading this book, you will learn about some of the key data management strategies at length. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">For now, however, I would like to bring six of these techniques to your attention. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">We will take a much closer look at each of these in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">upcoming chapters:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">Bring your data closer</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">: The closer the data is to users, the faster they can access it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">Yes, it may sound obvious, but users can be anywhere in the world, and they might even be traveling while trying to access their data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">For them, these details do not matter, but the expectation will remain </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">the same.</span></span><p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">There are many different ways to keep data physically close. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">One of the most successful strategies is</span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1"> called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">edge computing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">, which is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">Edge computing is an architecture rather than a specific technology (and a topology), and is a location-sensitive form of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">distributed computing.</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">The other very obvious strategy is to utilize the closest data center possible when utilizing a cloud provider. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">AWS, for example, spans 96 Availability Zones within 30 geographic Regions around the world as of 2022. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">Google Cloud offers a very similar 106 zones and 35 regions as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">of 2023.</span></span></p>
<p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Leveraging the nearest physical location can greatly decrease your latency and therefore your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">customer experience.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Reduce the length of your data journey</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">: Again, this is a very obvious one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">Try to avoid any unnecessary steps to create the shortest journey between the end user and their data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">Usually, the shortest will be the fastest (obviously it’s not that simple, but as a best practice, it can be applied). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.4">The greater the number of actions you do to retrieve the required information, the greater computational power you utilize, which directly increases the cost associated with the operation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.5">It also linearly increases the complexity and most of the time increases latency and cost </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">as well.</span></span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">The early days of DevOps</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">I first came across</span><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1"> DevOps around 2014 or so, just after the first annual </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">State of DevOps</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1"> report was published. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">At the time, the idea sounded great, but I had no idea how it worked. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">It felt like – at least to me – it was still in its infancy or I was not knowledgeable and experienced enough to see the big picture just yet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.4">Probably the latter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.5">Anyway, a lot has happened since then, and the industry picked up the pace. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.6">Agile, CI/CD, DevSecOps, GitOps, and other approaches emerged on the back of the original idea, which was to bring software developers and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">operations together.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">DevOps emerged as a response to longstanding frictions </span><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">between </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">developers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">Devs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">) and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">operations</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">Ops</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">) within</span><a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1"> the IT industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">The term </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">obvious</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1"> seems apt here because, for anyone involved in IT during that period, the tension was palpable and constant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">Devs traditionally focused solely on creating or fixing features, handing them off to Ops for deployment and ongoing management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">Conversely, Ops prioritized maintaining a stable production environment, often without the expertise to fully comprehend the code they </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">were implementing.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">This set up an inherent conflict: introducing new elements into a production environment is risky, so operational stability usually involves minimizing changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">This gave rise to a “Devs versus Ops” culture, a divide that DevOps sought to bridge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.3">However, achieving this required both sides to evolve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">and adapt.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">In the past, traditional operational roles such as system administrators, network engineers, and monitoring teams largely relied on manual processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">I can recall my initial stint at IBM, where the pinnacle of automation was a Bash script. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.3">Much of the work in those days – such as setting up physical infrastructure, configuring routing and firewalls, or manually handling failovers – was done </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">by hand.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">While SysAdmin and networking roles remain essential, even in the cloud era, the trend is clearly toward automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">This shift enhances system reliability as automated configurations are both traceable and reproducible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.3">If systems fail, they can be swiftly and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">accurately rebuilt.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">Though foundational knowledge of network and systems engineering is irreplaceable, the push toward automation necessitates software skills – a proficiency often lacking among traditional operational engineers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">What began with simple Bash scripts has evolved to include more complex programming languages such as Perl and Python, and specialized automation languages such as Puppet, Ansible, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">and Terraform.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">In terms of the development side, the development team worked with very long development life cycles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">They performed risky and infrequent “big-bang” releases that almost every time caused massive headaches for the Ops teams and posed a reliability/stability risk to the business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">Slowly but steadily, Dev teams moved to a more frequent, gradual approach that tolerated failures better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">Today, we call this </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">Agile development.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">If you look at it from this point of view, you can say that a set of common practices designed to reduce friction between Dev and Ops teams is the basis of DevOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">However, simple common practices could not solve the Dev versus Ops mentality that the industry possessed at the time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.3">Shared responsibility between Devs and Ops was necessary to drive this movement to success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.4">Automation that enables the promotion of new features into production rapidly and safely in a repeatable manner could only be achieved if</span><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1"> the two teams worked together, shared a common objective, and were accountable (and responsible) for the outcome together. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">This is where SRE came into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">the picture.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">SRE versus DevOps</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">SRE </span><a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">originated at Google. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">In the words of Ben </span><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">Treynor (VP of engineering at Google), “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">operations function</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">If you want to put it simply (again, I am quoting Google here), “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">Class SRE </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">implements DevOps</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">SRE is the (software) engineering discipline that aims to bridge the gap between Devs and Ops by treating all aspects of operations (infrastructure, monitoring, testing, and so on) as software, therefore implementing DevOps in its ultimate form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">This is fully automated, with zero manual interaction, treating every single change to any of its components (again referring to any changes to infrastructure, monitoring, testing, and so on) as a release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.3">Every change is done via a pipeline, in a version-controlled and tested manner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.4">If a release fails, or a production issue is observed and traced back to a change, you can simply roll back your changes to the previously known, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">healthy state.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">The fact that it is treated as any other software release allows the Dev teams to take on more responsibility and take part in Ops, almost fully blurring the line between the Dev and Ops functions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">Ultimately, this creates a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">You build it, you run it</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1"> culture – which makes “end-to-end” </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">ownership possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">So, are SRE and DevOps the same thing? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">No, they are not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.3">SRE is an engineering function that can also be described as a specific implementation of DevOps that focuses specifically on building and running reliable systems, whereas DevOps is a set of practices that is more broadly focused on bringing the traditional Dev and Ops functions </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">closer together.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Regardless of which way you go, you want to ensure that you set an objective, engineering </span><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">principles, and a tooling strategy that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">can help you make consistent decisions as you embark on your journey as a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">DevOps/SRE professional.</span></span></p>

<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">Service-level objectives</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">SLOs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">), which is a concept that’s</span><a id="_idIndexMarker032"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1"> referenced many times in Google’s SRE</span><a id="_idIndexMarker033"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1"> handbook, can be a great help to set your direction from the start. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.2">Choosing the right objective, however, can be trickier than you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">might think.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">My personal experience aligns with Google’s recommendation, which suggests that an SLO – which sets the target for the reliability of a service’s customers – should be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">under 100%.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">This is due to multiple reasons. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.2">Achieving 100% is not just very hard and extremely expensive, but almost impossible given that almost all services have soft/hard dependencies on other services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.3">If just one of your dependencies offers less than 100% availability, your SLO cannot be met. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.4">Also, even with every precaution you can make, and every redundancy in place, there is a non-zero probability that something (or many things) will fail, resulting in less than 100% availability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.5">More importantly, even if you could achieve 100% reliability of your services, the customers would very likely not experience that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.6">The path your customers must take (the systems they have to use) to access your services is likely to have less than </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">100% SLO.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">Most commercial internet providers, for example, offer 99% availability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.2">This also means that as you go higher and higher, let’s say from 99% to 99.9% or IBM’s extreme five nines (99.999%), the cost of achieving and maintaining this availability will be significantly more expensive the more “nines” you add, but your customers will experience less and less of your efforts, which makes the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">objective questionable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">Above the selected SLO threshold, almost all users should be “happy,” and below this threshold, users are likely to be unhappy, raise concerns, or just stop using </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">the service.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">Once you’ve agreed that you should look for an SLO less than 100%, but likely somewhere above or around 99%, how do you define the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">right baseline?</span></span></p>
