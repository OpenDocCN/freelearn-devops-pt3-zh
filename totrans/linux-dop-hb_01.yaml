    We will briefly touch on Linux history, explain what a distribution is, and explain
    what to take into account when choosing one for production use. You are not expected
    to know anything about Linux, its administration, or the cloud. If you don’t understand
    some words that we use, worry not. There shouldn’t be a lot of confusing terminology
    in this chapter, and if there is, we will explain it in later chapters. When you
    finish reading this chapter, you should be able to understand why there are so
    many Linuxes out there, how much you should expect to pay for it, and how to think
    about choosing the right Linux for yourself.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Linux is the standard operating system for cloud workloads. However, there is
    not a single Linux operating system that goes by that name. Its ecosystem is quite
    complex. This comes from how it came to be originally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Long before Linux was conceived by its creator, Linus Torvalds, there was *Unix*.
    Unix source code was – for legal reasons – licensed to anyone who bought it, thus
    making it very popular among many institutions. This included universities. The
    code, however, was not entirely free. This didn’t sit well with many people, who
    believed that software should be free – as in speech or beer – including source
    code. In the 1980s, a completely free and open implementation of Unix was born
    under the aegis of the *GNU Project*. Its goal was to develop an operating system
    that gave complete control over a computer to the user. The project was successful
    in that it was able to produce all the software required to run an operating system,
    except one thing – the kernel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **kernel** of the operating system is, in short, the core that operates hardware
    and manages the hardware and programs for the user.

    – Linux. He called it at that time “*just a hobby – won’t be big and professional
    like GNU.*” It wasn’t supposed to get big and popular. The rest is history. The
    Linux kernel became popular among developers and administrators and became the
    missing piece of the GNU Project. Linux is the kernel, the GNU tools are the so-called
    userland, and together they make the GNU/Linux operating system.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    users is called a **distribution**. It facilitates operating system installation,
    the means to manage software later on, and general notions on how an operating
    system and the running processes have to be managed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The open nature of Linux and the GNU Project made it possible for almost anyone
    to create their own distribution. One of the things that made new users dizzy
    was the sheer amount of **Operating System** (**OS**) versions they could use.
    The surefire way to start a holy war between Linux users is by asking which distribution
    is the best.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the ways we can group Linux distributions is the format in which they
    deliver the software (**packages**) and additional software used to install and
    remove that software (**package managers**). There are a number of them, but the
    two most prevalent are **RPM** (**RPM Package Manager**) and *DEB* packages. Packages
    are more than just an archive with binaries. They contain scripts that set the
    software up for use – creating directories, users, permissions, log rules, and
    a number of other things that we will explain in later chapters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The RPM family of distributions starts with **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** (**RHEL**),
    created and maintained by the Red Hat company. Closely related is *Fedora* (a
    free community distribution sponsored by Red Hat). It also includes *CentOS Linux*
    (a free version of RHEL) and *Rocky Linux* (another free version of RHEL).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DEB distributions include *Debian* (where the DEB packages originate from)
    – a technocracy community project. From the Debian distribution arose a number
    of distributions based on it, using most of its core components. Most notable
    is *Ubuntu*, a server and desktop distribution sponsored by Canonical.

    that a user can follow to build the whole OS by hand – the *Linux From* *Scratch*

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way of grouping distributions is by their acceptance of closed software
    – software that limits the distribution of source code, binaries, or both. This
    can mean hardware drivers, such as the ones for NVIDIA graphic cards, and user
    software, such as movie codecs that allow you to play streamed media and DVD and
    Blu-Ray discs. Some distributions make it easy to install and use them, while
    some make it more difficult, arguing that we should strive for all software to
    be open source and free (as in speech and as in beer).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet another way to differentiate them is the security framework a given distribution
    uses. Two of the most notable ones are *AppArmor*, used mainly by Ubuntu, and
    *SELinux* (from the USA’s National Security Agency), used by, among others, Red
    Hat Enterprise Linux (and its derivatives) and Fedora Linux.
  prefs: []

    as the userland, the popular one in the cloud Alpine Linux distribution uses its
    own set of software, written especially with minimum size in mind.

    any commercial entity being an owner of any part of the process and software –
    Debian being one prime example), commercial (wholly owned by a company – RHEL
    being one example and SuSE another), and all the mixes in between (Ubuntu and
    Fedora being examples of a commercially owned distribution with a large body of
    independent contributors).

    is deeply driven by ideals. For some people, they are the most important ideals
    on which they build their lives. Harsh words have been traded countless times
    over which text editor is better, based on their user interface, the license they
    are published with, or the quality of the source code. The same level of emotion
    is displayed toward the choice of software to run the WWW server or how to accept
    new contributions. This will inevitably lead to the way the Linux distribution
    is installed, what tools there are for configuration and maintenance, and how
    big the selection of software installed on it out of the box is.

    Debian Project. It is known for two things – the sheer number of packages that
    the distribution provides and the slow release of stable versions. The latter
    has improved in recent years and stable releases are published every two years.
    Software is delivered in archives called packages. Debian packages’ names have
    a `.deb` file extension and are colloquially called **debs**. They are kept online
    in repositories and repositories are broken down into pools. Repositories offer
    almost 60,000 packages with software in the latest stable release.

    announced that the versioned releases of CentOS would no longer be available;
    there would only be the so-called rolling release, which constantly updates packages
    and does not mirror the RHEL releases. This resulted in a very heated reaction
    from CentOS users. The original CentOS founder, Gregory Kurtzer, started another

- en: CentOS ([https://centos.org](https://centos.org)) used to be the go-to free
    version of RHEL. The name is an acronym for **Community Enterprise Operating System**.
    Its main goal was to be fully binary-compatible with RHEL and adhere to the same
    releases and numbering scheme. In 2014, CentOS joined Red Hat, but it was promised
    that the distribution would keep its independence from the company while benefiting
    from development and testing resources. Unfortunately, in 2020, Red Hat announced
    that CentOS 8 would be the last numbered release, and from then on, CentOS Stream
    would be the only variant. CentOS Stream is a midstream version. This means it
    sits in the middle between bleeding-edge and fast-paced Fedora and stable and
    production-ready RHEL. The difference between CentOS Stream and CentOS is that
    Stream is a development variant, while CentOS was simply a rebuilt and repackaged
    mirror of the actual final product, RHEL.

    100% applicable to CentOS. Since CentOS is the third most-deployed Linux distribution
    on servers, according to W3Techs ([https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux)),
    the skills are very marketable.

    the creation of Rocky Linux ([https://rockylinux.org/](https://rockylinux.org/)).
    The goals are the same as the original CentOS. The release scheme and numbering
    follow RHEL. Shortly after the announcement, the GitHub repository of Rocky Linux
    became top trending ([https://web.archive.org/web/20201212220049/https://github.com/trending](https://web.archive.org/web/20201212220049/https://github.com/trending)).
    Rocky Linux is 100% binary-compatible with CentOS. The project has released a
    set of tools that easily migrate from CentOS to Rocky Linux without reinstalling
    the system.

    preferred choice.

- en: Alpine Linux ([https://alpinelinux.org/](https://alpinelinux.org/)) is an interesting
    one. The main programming library and most basic command-line tools are not from
    the GNU Project. Also, the services management system, currently **systemd** in
    most distributions, is uncommon. This makes some of the administration skills
    from other major distributions non-applicable. The strength of Alpine lies in
    its size (which is rather small), its security-first mindset, and one of the fastest
    boot times among existing Linux distributions. Those characteristics, with the
    boot time being admittedly more important, make it the most popular choice for
    containers. If you run containerized software or build your own container images,
    it is very likely that it is on Alpine Linux.

    see: [https://bering-uclibc.zetam.org/wiki/Main_Page](https://bering-uclibc.zetam.org/wiki/Main_Page))
    project – a Linux distribution that fits on a single floppy disk. LEAF is currently
    a popular choice for embedded markets, routers, and firewalls. Alpine is a bigger
    distribution, but that sacrifice had to be made, since developers wanted to include
    several useful but rather large software packages.'

    distribution called Gentoo Linux. As Gentoo builds software as it installs it,
    the portage obviously contains a lot of logic around building software that is
    used as a part of an OS.

    you to initially only load a few required packages from the boot device, and it
    can be achieved using Alpine’s **Local Backup** **Utility** (**LBU**).
