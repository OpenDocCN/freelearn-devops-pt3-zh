			<p><strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) is the leader in cloud computing and has successfully maintained that position for many years now. Companies across the globe, in both the public and private sectors, continue to embrace cloud technologies at an ever-increasing rate, and the demand for IT professionals with experience of AWS far outstrips supply. </p>
			<p>The <em class="italic">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam Guide</em> is your one-stop resource to help you prepare for one of the most popular AWS certification exams. This study guide will help you validate your understanding of the core cloud computing services offered by AWS as well as learn how to architect and build cloud solutions for your clients.</p>
			<p>Passing this foundation certification doesn't require you to know how to build and deploy complex multi-tier application solutions. However, this book gives you the necessary skills to understand how the various services offered by AWS can be used to architect end-to-end solutions for your client. In addition, you will learn about cloud economics, security concepts, and best practices.</p>
			<p>This study guide is designed to be used even after you pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, with multiple exercises that can be used as a reference to help you start building real-world solutions for your clients. Each chapter builds on the previous one, with each new exercise extending a previously configured service. This will allow you to determine how the individual services offered by AWS can be used to design end-to-end solutions.</p>
			<p>Each chapter also includes a summary followed by a set of review questions. The book ends with two mock tests that are designed to test your knowledge and help you further prepare for the official AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This study guide is designed for anyone looking to fast-track their career in cloud computing. The <em class="italic">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner </em>Exam Guide is designed for both IT and non-IT professionals who wish to learn the fundamentals of cloud computing and the AWS offering. Non-IT professionals can benefit from this study guide as they learn not only the theoretical concepts of a wide range of cloud services offered by AWS, but also gain valuable experience in configuring those services from a technical perspective. IT professionals who have primarily worked in on-premises environments will learn how to provision and deploy technical solutions in the cloud and understand strategies for migrating their on-premises workloads to AWS.</p>
