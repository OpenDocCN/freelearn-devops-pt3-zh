			<h1 id="_idParaDest-313"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>Avoiding Pitfalls and Diving into the Future</h1>
			<p>The DevOps movement has evolved and changed in many ways since the Flickr talk at the 2009 Velocity Conference. New advances in technology, such as containers and Kubernetes, have changed many of the core practices. New ways of doing things such as <strong class="bold">site reliability engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>) have changed the roles <span class="No-Break">people play.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will examine how to start incorporating the principles and practices discussed throughout the book so that you can successfully move toward a DevOps transformation or move <span class="No-Break">to SAFe®.</span></p>
			<p>We will look at some emerging trends that may play a major role in the evolution of DevOps. We will look at XOps, which seeks to incorporate more parts of the organizations into the collaborative approach seen in DevOps and DevSecOps. We will also have a look at an alternative view to the standard linear <span class="No-Break">value stream.</span></p>
			<p>We will also examine new technologies that have emerged that promise to change how we work. With AI for IT Operations, also called AIOps, we will examine the growing role <strong class="bold">Artificial </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Intelligence</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">AI</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span>
and <strong class="bold">Machine Learning (ML</strong>) play in predicting problems and vulnerabilities. We will look at the merge between version control and <strong class="bold">Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) when we <span class="No-Break">examine GitOps.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we will look at common questions that may come up with <span class="No-Break">some answers.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>Avoiding pitfalls</h1>
			<p>In the journey toward<a id="_idIndexMarker997"/> a DevOps approach, it only makes sense that not everyone will follow the same path. Different organizations are at different stages of readiness to accept the mindset change needed to allow for a successful <span class="No-Break">DevOps journey.</span></p>
			<p>That being said, we will look at a set of steps for starting or restarting a DevOps approach based on what we have learned in the previous chapters of this book. You will see that there is frequently no direct path from one step to <span class="No-Break">the next.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s view the following steps for our <span class="No-Break">DevOps journey:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understand <span class="No-Break">the system</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Start small</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Start automating</span></li>
				<li>Measure, learn, <span class="No-Break">and pivot</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lets start on our <span class="No-Break">journey now.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>Understand the system</h2>
			<p>Whether we are starting fresh<a id="_idIndexMarker998"/> or restarting after stumbling, we need to take a step from the Improvement Kata from Lean thinking and evaluate where we are. This evaluation should be a holistic look at the existing processes, the people behind the processes, and if tools are <span class="No-Break">enabling processes.</span></p>
			<p>One way of looking at all these facets is to do a value stream mapping, as first discussed in <a href="B18756_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor163"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping Your Value Streams</em>. As we originally spoke about in that chapter, performing a value stream mapping workshop allows you to discover the <span class="No-Break">following things:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The process steps in your workflow from beginning <span class="No-Break">to end</span></li>
				<li>The people that perform those <span class="No-Break">process steps</span></li>
				<li>Possible areas <span class="No-Break">for improvement</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The value stream mapping workshop also gives the perspective of looking at the scope of the entire effort of development in a broader perspective of a system. This systemic view is not just a series of process steps and improvements, but also how tools work in this process, or can work in the process if they’re <span class="No-Break">not incorporated.</span></p>
			<p>A value stream mapping workshop produces two value streams: the current value stream and an <em class="italic">ideal</em> value stream<a id="_idIndexMarker999"/> that contains enhancements and improvements to lower cycle time and lead time and increases <strong class="bold">Percent Complete and Accurate</strong> (<strong class="bold">%C&amp;A</strong>). Record these enhancements so that the people in the value<a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/> stream will work on them as part of <strong class="bold">continuous </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">learning</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CL</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>Start small</h2>
			<p>After the value stream mapping<a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/> workshop, look at the list of improvements and enhancements from the <em class="italic">ideal</em> value stream. From the list of enhancements, the people in the value stream should select what they consider the most important enhancement to <span class="No-Break">work on.</span></p>
			<p>Allowing only one enhancement at a time promotes focus. We’ve seen this in <a href="B18756_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Leveraging</em> <em class="italic">Lean Flow to Keep the Work Moving</em>, where working in small batch sizes avoids the problems that multitasking can bring in preventing work <span class="No-Break">from completing.</span></p>
			<p>One such enhancement may be to decrease cycle and lead time in developing your products by increasing flow. The practices in <a href="B18756_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>—such as small batch sizes, monitoring queues, and limiting WIP—can also help with this step. Following these practices may lead to increased agility that gets better with a <span class="No-Break">DevOps approach.</span></p>
			<p>Another area of improvement the people of the value stream can look at is the use of their tooling. The first foundational tool to consider is version control. The teams in the value stream should evaluate putting all their files in a version control system. If they are already using version control, they should ensure that they are using a common version control system and that everyone has the <span class="No-Break">necessary access.</span></p>
			<p>In addition to selecting a version control system, the people of the value stream should select a branching model that outlines how they will branch from the trunk and when to merge changes back to the main branch <span class="No-Break">or trunk.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-317"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Start automating</h2>
			<p>A key step toward improving the value stream<a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/> is establishing a CI/CD pipeline. If the organization has not established a CI/CD pipeline, it may establish one that comes included with many version control systems. Other organizations may want to have the flexibility that comes from installing a separate CI/CD pipeline tool. Either approach works, as the most important thing is the creation of such <span class="No-Break">a pipeline.</span></p>
			<p>The CI/CD pipeline can then be triggered from version control when a commit occurs. Add the necessary actions that occur after the commit, one action at a time. These actions may start with building or compiling the changes that come from the commit. A completed build can then allow the merge into the higher-level branch and possibly save the build artifacts into an <span class="No-Break">artifact repository.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Start automating the testing</h2>
			<p>Once the endpoints of the CI/CD pipeline<a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/> are defined, you can fill other intermediate steps of the pipeline with automated testing. You can create tests that will automatically run and find problems with functionality <span class="No-Break">and security.</span></p>
			<p>Start by creating, one by one, automated tests that comprise the <span class="No-Break">following categories:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Unit testing</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Functional testing</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">System testing</span></li>
				<li>Security testing (<strong class="bold">static application security testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAST</strong>), <strong class="bold">dynamic application security testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAST</strong>), and <span class="No-Break">other scans)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Development<a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/> of the automated testing now encourages the creation<a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/> of multiple environments for deployment, such as test, staging, and production. Unit test passage can allow for the deployment of a test environment for the other levels <span class="No-Break">of testing.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Create environments, deployments, and monitoring</h2>
			<p>The establishment<a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/> of testing allows<a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/> us to establish the different<a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/> pre-production environments, all of them equivalent as far as practicality <span class="No-Break">will allow.</span></p>
			<p>Introducing a new pre-production environment also allows us to introduce monitoring for these pre-production environments. Monitoring can start on the test environment until we have high enough confidence to deploy the monitoring on staging environments, and ultimately on <span class="No-Break">production itself.</span></p>
			<p>Constructing the pre-production environments<a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/> allows us to establish the tooling to do the construction. Configuration management tooling and <strong class="bold">Infrastructure-as-Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) can be added to define and configure the environments. Establishing standard configurations allow capabilities such as rollback <span class="No-Break">to occur.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Measure, learn, and pivot</h2>
			<p>At every step, we should evaluate whether <a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/>each additional step we add<a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/> is working to bring us closer to the ideal future state<a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/> value stream. Make adjustments as needed. These tiny course corrections allow <span class="No-Break">for CL.</span></p>
			<p>There may be questions about whether the timing is right to pivot. The justification is always to avoid the <em class="italic">sunk cost</em> fallacy, where people hold on, avoiding change even in the face of overwhelming evidence that change <span class="No-Break">should happen.</span></p>
			<p>One final note: an apocryphal story holds that John F. Kennedy noted that the Chinese term for <em class="italic">crisis</em> was made<a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/> up of the Chinese words for <em class="italic">danger</em> and <em class="italic">opportunity</em>. While it is true that the first part of the Chinese term for <em class="italic">crisis</em> on its own equals <em class="italic">danger</em>, the second part of the term on its own translates to <em class="italic">point of change</em> or <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">turning point</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Adopting SAFe or adopting DevOps is a lot like watching the characters that make up a <em class="italic">crisis</em>. Watching the <em class="italic">danger</em> and watching the <em class="italic">turning points</em> will keep us away from <span class="No-Break">the </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">crisis</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Throughout this book, we’ve talked about the evolution of DevOps from its beginnings in 2009 to the present day. Let’s now talk about trends that are starting <span class="No-Break">to emerge.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Emerging trends in DevOps</h1>
			<p>One of the themes that contributed<a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/> to the success of the DevOps movement was the collaboration between two separate functions of an organization, Development and Operations, to achieve the greater goal of releasing products frequently but also allowing stability in the <span class="No-Break">production environment.</span></p>
			<p>As the movement grew, its success encouraged more imaginative efforts at collaboration to encourage other aspects besides increased deployment frequency and stability. Some of the reimagined efforts we will examine include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">XOps</span></li>
				<li>The <span class="No-Break">Revolution model</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Platform engineering</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s begin our exploration into the potential future <span class="No-Break">of DevOps.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>XOps</h2>
			<p>The success<a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/> of the DevOps movement<a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/> has encouraged the inclusion of other parts of the organization with Development and Operations to allow for speed of other qualities in addition to development frequency and stability. Notable movements include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">DevSecOps</strong>: The incorporation of security throughout<a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/> the stages of the pipeline to ensure that security is not left behind. Currently, many people consider the practices that are performed in a DevSecOps approach are fully absorbed in the <span class="No-Break">DevOps movement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">BizDevOps</strong>: Hailed as DevOps 2.0 this movement adds<a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/> collaboration between business teams, developers, and operations personnel for the added goal of maximizing <span class="No-Break">business revenue.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, other engineering<a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/> disciplines have found<a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/> success in employing the same practices first promoted in DevOps. These DevOps-based movements for adjacent disciplines include <strong class="bold">DataOps</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ModelOps</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at how a DevOps approach works in these <span class="No-Break">engineering disciplines.</span></p>
			<h3>DataOps</h3>
			<p>DataOps is the incorporation of Agile<a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/> development<a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/> principles, DevOps practices, and Lean thinking into the field of data analysis and <span class="No-Break">data analytics.</span></p>
			<p>Data analysis follows a process flow similar to product development. The following steps are part of a typical process for <span class="No-Break">data analysis:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Specification of the requirements for the data by those directing the analysis or <span class="No-Break">by customers</span></li>
				<li>Collection of <span class="No-Break">the data</span></li>
				<li>Processing data using statistical software <span class="No-Break">or spreadsheets</span></li>
				<li>Data cleaning to remove duplicates <span class="No-Break">or errors</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Exploratory data </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">analysis</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">EDA</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>Data modeling to <span class="No-Break">find relationships</span></li>
				<li>Creating outputs by using a data <span class="No-Break">product application</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Reporting</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As the volume of data increases exponentially, new methods are called into service to allow insights to be quickly obtained. The following methods used resemble the steps seen in DevOps for <span class="No-Break">product development:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The establishment of a data pipeline that allows for the processing of data into reports and analytics using the data <span class="No-Break">analysis process</span></li>
				<li>Verification of the data flowing<a id="_idIndexMarker1023"/> through the data pipeline through <strong class="bold">Statistical Process </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Controls</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">SPC</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>Adding automated testing to ensure the data is correct in the data cleaning, data analysis, and data <span class="No-Break">modeling stages</span></li>
				<li>Measurement of the data flow through the <span class="No-Break">data pipeline</span></li>
				<li>Separation of data into development, test, and production environments to ensure the correct function of automation for the <span class="No-Break">data pipeline</span></li>
				<li>Collaboration between data scientists, analysts, data engineers, IT, and <span class="No-Break">quality assurance/governance</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The ability to easily find relationships<a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/> based on voluminous amounts of data provides a competitive<a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/> advantage. Using DataOps practices and principles may allow those creating insights from data to achieve greater deployment rates of reliable and error-free <span class="No-Break">data analytics.</span></p>
			<h3>ModelOps</h3>
			<p>One of the largest trends<a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/> in technology today is AI. This growing<a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/> trend sets up ML and decision models that leverage large amounts of data to progressively improve performance. The development of these ML models can give a competitive advantage to any organization looking to understand more about their customers and how their products <span class="No-Break">can help.</span></p>
			<p>Developing effective models now goes through a development cycle, similar to the <strong class="bold">software development life cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>) process. In December 2018, Waldemar Hummer and Vinod Muthusamy<a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/> of IBM Research AI proposed the initial concept of ModelOps, where AI workflows were made more reusable, platform-independent, and composable using techniques derived from the <span class="No-Break">DevOps approach.</span></p>
			<p>The model life cycle covers how to create, train, deploy, monitor, and, based on feedback from the data, retrain the AI model for an enterprise. The following diagram demonstrates the path of the model <span class="No-Break">life cycle:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer129" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_14_01.jpg" alt="Figure 14.1 – ModelOps life cycle (By Jforgo1 – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=99598780)"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.1 – ModelOps life cycle (By Jforgo1 – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=99598780)</p>
			<p>Because of the similarities<a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/> between the model life cycle and the SDLC, the desired behaviors of deploying<a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/> changes rapidly, monitoring their effects on the environment, and learning to improve allow for AI models developed using ModelOps to align with AI applications created using DevOps and have both rely on data analytics developed <span class="No-Break">using DataOps.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>The Revolution model</h2>
			<p>The concept of value streams<a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/> for software development takes as a model<a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/> the traditional SDLC process. This process, a remnant from Waterfall development, assumes that development happens in a step-by-step linear motion from one activity to the next. As products become more complex and DevOps expands the areas of responsibility, does a linear one-way progression of activities <span class="No-Break">make sense?</span></p>
			<p>Emily Freeman, Head of Community Engagement at <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) and the author of <em class="italic">DevOps for Dummies</em>, has proposed<a id="_idIndexMarker1033"/> a different way of looking at the development process. Instead of a straight-line approach, she outlines a model where priorities move forward and back, along circles of activity. She calls this model <strong class="bold">Revolution</strong>. Let’s take a <span class="No-Break">closer look.</span></p>
			<p>Freeman outlines the following five software development roles as concentric circles <span class="No-Break">radiating out:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Operating</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Deploying</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Automating</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Developing</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Architecting</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Intersecting those circles are six qualities that engineers must consider in each activity. These qualities, listed here, are drawn as spokes against the <span class="No-Break">concentric circles:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Testability</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Securability</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Reliability</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Observability</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Flexibility</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Scalability</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With the parts in place, let’s present the following diagram of <span class="No-Break">the model:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer130" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18756_14_02.jpg" alt="Figure 14.2 – Revolution model"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.2 – Revolution model</p>
			<p>To ensure the six qualities<a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/> are adequately met, an engineer or team member would jump<a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/> from one role (or circle) to the next, starting from the outside in. Roles are meant to be temporarily adopted by the engineer for some period of time until they are not needed at the moment. In an incident management scenario that Freeman illustrates in a keynote (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNBXfgWcy5Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNBXfgWcy5Q</a>), the team has members assume roles in operating, developing, and deploying to investigate whether adequate reliability, observability, flexibility, scalability, and <span class="No-Break">testability occur.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>Platform engineering</h2>
			<p>The vast amount of tooling and technology<a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/> involved in cloud-native environments<a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/> has accelerated in the past few years. The level of knowledge needed to set up and maintain test, staging, and production environments on which products reside has overwhelmed those responsible for <span class="No-Break">their operation.</span></p>
			<p>Historically, DevOps started with the inclusion of Operations in an Agile development process so that stability and development speed are equally maintained. Over time, Operations has embraced using an Agile development<a id="_idIndexMarker1038"/> mindset to solve reliability problems of large systems with SRE. Charity Majors, the CTO of honeycomb.io, a leading company in the development of a monitoring<a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/> and observability platform, writes in a blog article (<a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/future-ops-platform-engineering">https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/future-ops-platform-engineering</a>) that the next step is to look at the environments that are the responsibility of Operations as products themselves that can be developed using an Agile <span class="No-Break">development mindset.</span></p>
			<p>Platform engineering, as defined by Luca Galante of Humanitec (<a href="https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering">https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering</a>), designs toolchains and workflows to allow self-service capabilities using this Agile development mindset. The product <a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/>developed through platform engineering is an <strong class="bold">Internal Developer Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDP</strong>), an abstraction of the technology used in operational environments for developers to build their products <span class="No-Break">and solutions.</span></p>
			<p>Developers will use the following five components of an IDP to establish the capabilities required by their product <span class="No-Break">or solution:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application Configuration Management (ACM)</strong>: This includes the automatic creation<a id="_idIndexMarker1041"/> of manifest files used by configuration management tools to deploy <span class="No-Break">application changes</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Infrastructure Orchestration</strong>: This establishes integration between<a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/> the CI pipeline with the environments for deployment, including possible cluster creation/updates, IAC, and <span class="No-Break">image registries</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Environment Management</strong>: This integrates the ACM<a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/> of the IDP with the underlying infrastructure of the environments to allow developers to create fully provisioned environments <span class="No-Break">when needed</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deployment Management</strong>: This sets up the<a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/> <span class="No-Break">CD pipeline</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: This allows granular access<a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/> to the environment and <span class="No-Break">its resources</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We have seen trends emerge<a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/> as people look at applying changes to processes, but DevOps<a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/> will continue to change as technology changes. Let’s look at trends in DevOps that are driven by advances <span class="No-Break">in technology.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>New technologies in DevOps</h1>
			<p>DevOps today has expanded<a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/> beyond what was originally envisioned in 2009, in part due to advances in technology that encouraged deployment into cloud-native environments. Advances today promise to add new capabilities <span class="No-Break">never imagined.</span></p>
			<p>The technologies we will examine for changing DevOps come from both refinements in deploying to cloud-native environments and applications on exciting new technology. We will take a look at these technology-based DevOps trends: <strong class="bold">AIOps</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">GitOps</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s start out by looking to the future <span class="No-Break">with AIOps.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>AIOps</h2>
			<p>We discussed in the previous section<a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/> the rise of the use of AI to create applications<a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/> that can learn from the large amounts of data presented to AI models. One area that can benefit from improved insights based on large amounts of data may be product development that uses a DevOps approach and collects the data through full-stack telemetry. This is different from our previous discussions of DataOps or ModelOps because this time, we are applying ML and data visualization to our actual <span class="No-Break">development process.</span></p>
			<p>AI for IT Operations (or AIOps) looks to enhance traditional practices we previously identified in the CI, CD, and Release on Demand stages of the CD pipeline to incorporate tools that are based on ML to process the amount of data that comes from our full-stack telemetry. Incorporation of AIOps tools may assist in making sense of the following areas of the <span class="No-Break">IT environment:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Systems</strong>: Testing, staging, and production environments<a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/> may be a complex mix of cloud-native and on-premise resources. Cloud resources may come from one or more vendors. The resources may be a mix of physical computing servers (“bare-metal”) or use a form of virtualization such as <strong class="bold">virtual machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>) or containers. This large mix of resources ensures the environment is stable <span class="No-Break">and reliable.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data</strong>: Full-stack telemetry creates<a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/> mountains of data. Some of this data may be key to making crucial decisions, while some may not. How can we determine when the amount of data <span class="No-Break">is voluminous?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tools</strong>: To acquire full-stack telemetry, a wide variety<a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/> of tools may be employed to collect the data and manage the systems. These tools may not operate with one another or may be limited in functionality, creating silos <span class="No-Break">of data.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To answer this challenge, tools incorporating ML may adopt the following types of <span class="No-Break">AI algorithms:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data selection</strong>: This analyzes data to remove redundant<a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/> and <span class="No-Break">non-relevant information</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pattern discovery</strong>: This examines the data to <span class="No-Break">determine</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/></span><span class="No-Break"> relationships</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inference</strong>: This looks at the insights<a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/> to identify <span class="No-Break">root causes</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collaboration</strong>: This enables automation of notifications<a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/> to teams of <span class="No-Break">problems discovered</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automation</strong>: This looks to automate a response<a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/> to <span class="No-Break">recurring problems</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These tools have applications<a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/> in terms of identifying security vulnerabilities, finding root causes of production failures, or even identifying trends that may predict impending problems in your production environments. As the technology improves, the promise of the viability of AIOps to be a more standard part of DevOps and IT <span class="No-Break">operations grows.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>GitOps</h2>
			<p>As acceptance of CI/CD pipelines grew, many<a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/> wondered how to establish<a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/> these pipelines to deploy features into cloud-native testing, staging, and production environments. In 2017, Weaveworks coined the term <em class="italic">GitOps</em>, suggesting a CI/CD approach that is triggered from a commit in Git, a popular version <span class="No-Break">control program.</span></p>
			<p>GitOps starts with version control. There are separate repositories for the application and the environment configuration. The application repository will contain the code for the product, including how to build the product as a container in a Dockerfile. The environment repository will contain configuration files and scripts for a CI/CD pipeline tool, as well as deployment records for <span class="No-Break">the environments.</span></p>
			<p>Deployments in GitOps can either be push-based or pull-based. A push-based deployment uses the customary CI/CD pipeline tools to move from CI to CD. Pull-based deployment employs an operator that observes changes to the environment repository. When those changes occur, the operator deploys the changes to the environment according to the environment <span class="No-Break">repository changes.</span></p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the progression from the Git repository to the CI pipeline to the operator and <span class="No-Break">deployment pipeline:</span></p>

			<p>GitOps has had a tremendous following with those looking to set up deployment using Kubernetes, a technology that packages Docker containers to set up clusters of microservices. As Kubernetes becomes more popular, GitOps has become an established practice to continuously<a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/> deploy Kubernetes clusters to <span class="No-Break">cloud-based</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/></span><span class="No-Break"> environments.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>Frequently asked questions</h1>
			<p>We now take a look at some questions that may come up, even after reading the earlier parts of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>What is DevOps?</h2>
			<p>DevOps is a technical movement<a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/> for developing and maintaining products. It incorporates Lean thinking and Agile development principles and practices to extend focus beyond development to the deployment, release, and maintenance of new products and their features. DevOps promotes the use of automation and tooling to allow frequent testing for proper functionality and security and allow for consistent deployments and releases. As products move to release, DevOps models operational practices done by developers and operations personnel that allow for rapid recovery should problems appear in production environments in a mission-based <span class="No-Break">generative culture.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>What is the Scaled Agile Framework®?</h2>
			<p>The Scaled Agile Framework, or SAFe, is a set<a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/> of values, principles, and practices developed by Scaled Agile, Inc. SAFe is primarily adopted by medium and large-size organizations working to introduce Lean and Agile ways of working for teams of teams and portfolios in enterprises. As Scaled Agile, Inc. <span class="No-Break">defines it:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">SAFe for Lean Enterprises is the world’s leading framework for business agility. SAFe integrates the power of Lean, Agile, and DevOps into a comprehensive operating system that helps enterprises thrive in the digital age by delivering innovative products and services faster, more predictably, and with higher quality. — © Scaled Agile, Inc.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>Do I need to adopt SAFe to move to DevOps?</h2>
			<p>No. We look at SAFe while talking about DevOps<a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/> because a key perspective of working in SAFe is the focus on creating and organizing<a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/> value streams for its team of teams, known as an <strong class="bold">Agile Release Train</strong> (<strong class="bold">ART</strong>). SAFe also focuses on process and automation through its CD pipeline. Both of these are in line with successful <span class="No-Break">DevOps approaches.</span></p>
			<p>Adopting the SAFe is best suited when your value stream can be accomplished by a team of 5-12 regular-sized teams and this <em class="italic">team of teams</em> is working<a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/> together on a single product or solution. This is known as the <em class="italic">Essential </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">SAFe</em></span><span class="No-Break"> configuration.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Is DevOps only for those companies that develop for cloud environments?</h2>
			<p>While many of the recent technical<a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/> strides in DevOps were developed to help those develop, test, deploy, release, and maintain on cloud environments, DevOps as a technical movement is agnostic to whichever technology your product is <span class="No-Break">based on.</span></p>
			<p>DevOps principles and practices have been successful in organizations that develop and maintain products on cloud, embedded hardware, mainframe, and physical server environments. Practices such as the adoption of Lean thinking, value stream management, and SRE do not rely on the technology used by the <span class="No-Break">end product.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>What’s the best tool for doing ___________?</h2>
			<p>A common question<a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/> is to ask what the most preferred tool is to perform a specific function such as CI/CD, automated testing, configuration management, or security testing. I always refrain from picking an individual tool for <span class="No-Break">several reasons.</span></p>
			<p>The primary reason is that every industry and organization is different. A tool that works for one industry or organization may not work for a different industry <span class="No-Break">or organization.</span></p>
			<p>Another reason is that technology moves onward, releasing new tools that may now be <span class="No-Break">considered “best.”</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>How does DevSecOps fit into DevOps?</h2>
			<p>Earlier in this chapter, we saw<a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/> how DevSecOps was one of the first models of XOps where what eventually happened was the incorporation of a security mindset and practices into the broader definition of DevOps. With DevSecOps, we are adding security as a focus in addition to the desired foci of development speed and operational stability in <em class="italic">vanilla</em> DevOps. In this book, we outlined several places where including security practices move us from DevOps <span class="No-Break">to DevSecOps.</span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B18756_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Recovering from Production Failures</em>, we saw that Chaos Engineering could be used to simulate disasters such as a security vulnerability and evaluate potential responses to such <span class="No-Break">security failures.</span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B18756_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor221"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Continuous Exploration and Finding New Features</em>, we discovered that security was one of the primary considerations when trying to create new features for products. This consideration is handled by the system architect, often consulting with the organization’s <span class="No-Break">security team.</span></p>
			<p>We extended security further in <a href="B18756_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor244"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Continuous Integration of Solution Development</em>, and <a href="B18756_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor268"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Continuous Deployment to Production</em>, where we looked at adding security testing in various forms to detect potential vulnerabilities. During CI, we performed threat modeling to identify any potential <span class="No-Break">attack vectors.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, in <a href="B18756_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor292"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Releasing on Demand to Realize Value</em>, we looked at continuous security monitoring<a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/> and continuous security practices in the production environment to remain vigilant and fix environments when vulnerabilities do <span class="No-Break">get exploited.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this final chapter, we looked to the future. We first saw the emerging trends happening to DevOps from the product development side. New advances incorporating AI and data engineering have added new components to products under development. Development of artifacts such as AI models and data pipelines shows great benefits using a DevOps approach in new fields such as DataOps and ModelOps. We also examined a new look at software development and maintenance that may influence DevOps and value <span class="No-Break">stream management.</span></p>
			<p>Changes in technology have changed DevOps as well. We looked at incorporating AIOps products that include AI for analyzing the data collected in testing and maintenance to find vulnerabilities and potential failures. We explored the GitOps movement that unites version control <span class="No-Break">with CD.</span></p>
			<p>We then moved from the future of DevOps to making DevOps part of your organization’s future. We looked at adopting DevOps practices, including mapping your value stream and iteratively employing automation in different areas of your development process. We then finished with some questions you may have and <span class="No-Break">their answers.</span></p>
			<p>We have explored the different aspects of DevOps, from looking at the motivations of people to understanding the processes at play and examining the tools that can help achieve higher levels of performance. All three aspects are adopted in the SAFe so that teams of teams can perform together as a value stream to develop, deploy, and maintain products that provide value to the customer. It is our hope that this exploration helps guide your thoughts as you continue your <span class="No-Break">DevOps journey.</span></p>
