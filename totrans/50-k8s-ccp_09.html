			<p>Throughout this book so far, you’ve learned about key critical pieces of Kubernetes. First, you learned about various cluster methods. You learned about on-premises, how to deploy various managed Kubernetes services, and the different options that are available <span class="No-Break">when deploying.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>After that, you learned about different deployment methods, both from a <em class="italic">basic</em> perspective and an <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">advanced</em></span><span class="No-Break"> perspective.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The only things that are missing, which are arguably the most important pieces to a proper Kubernetes environment, are monitoring, observability, and security. The third and final piece of the 50 concepts will go over what monitoring and observability look like in <span class="No-Break">today’s world.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In the last two chapters, you’ll learn all about monitoring, observability, and security. You’ll dive into the theory behind monitoring and observability, along with the hands-on portions of each so you can get a true understanding of how to implement different tools. Next, you’ll dive into security, which is typically overlooked in general but especially overlooked <span class="No-Break">in Kubernetes.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>By the end of these, you’ll have a solid theoretical overview of monitoring, observability, and security, along with real code examples for implementing the different tools and <span class="No-Break">platforms available.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This part of the book comprises the <span class="No-Break">following chapters:</span></p>&#13;
