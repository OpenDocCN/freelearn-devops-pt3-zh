    one or two small Agile teams, such as Scrum, to address its business problem-solving
    or development needs. However, this isn’t always the case, especially in larger
    organizations. Additionally, many of the individuals required to support business

- en: Operating within the context of value streams, BLAST implements a team-of-teams
    concept to synchronize work across either a single value stream or multiple streams
    with the latter being more common. While some teams and individuals within BLAST
    adhere to Lean-flow principles and practices for their day-to-day work, others

  zh: 定义 BLAST 增量
- en: A BLAST focuses on creating **minimum valuable increments** (**MVIs**). However,
    MVIs are not always released as soon as they are available. Very often, MVIs will
    be bundled together to create an MVRs. These MVRs may come from one BLAST or from
    multiple BLASTs. When this occurs, the sequence within which we create the MVIs
    may be dependent upon their being bundled with other MVIs to create an MVR or
    integrated increment. Conceptually, an integrated increment is a bundling of MVIs
    to assemble a complete solution or components of a product release. MVRs are specified
    in BASE planning activities since they are part of product management-defined
    releases.

  zh: BLAST 的核心目标是创建**最小可用增量**（**MVIs**）。然而，MVIs 并不总是会在可用时立即发布。通常，多个 MVIs 会被捆绑在一起，形成
    MVRs。这些 MVRs 可能来源于一个 BLAST，也可能来自多个 BLAST。当这种情况发生时，创建 MVIs 的顺序可能取决于它们是否与其他 MVIs
    一起捆绑，以形成 MVR 或集成增量。从概念上讲，集成增量是将 MVIs 捆绑在一起，以组装一个完整的解决方案或产品发布的组件。MVRs 在 BASE 规划活动中被指定，因为它们是产品管理定义的发布的一部分。

- en: In contrast, Agile practices embrace a more participatory, bottom-up approach
    where the insights and contributions of team members are of higher importance.
    However, decentralized decision-making across the organization requires more collaboration,
    and teams may encounter coordination challenges, especially when a team of teams
    has different viewpoints, goals, and objectives. If we limit our views to these
    two management extremes, one could argue that a top-down strategy may provide
    clearer strategic intent even as the decentralized approach can improve the engagement
    and alignment of employees in their work.

  zh: 相比之下，敏捷实践采取更具参与性、从下至上的方法，在这种方法中，团队成员的见解和贡献更为重要。然而，组织内去中心化的决策制定需要更多的协作，团队可能会遇到协调挑战，尤其是当多个团队的观点、目标和任务不同的时候。如果我们将视野局限于这两种管理极端，有人可能会认为，自上而下的战略可以提供更清晰的战略意图，而去中心化的方式则能提高员工在工作中的参与度和一致性。
- en: Lean provides a more balanced approach by considering the roles of executive
    and middle management in supporting the work of multiple teams as they interact
    across one or more value streams. For example, in a Lean organization, executive
    managers serve as the architects of organizational strategy, orchestrating the
    vision and providing a cohesive force that aligns all levels of the company. Middle
    managers also play a crucial role in Lean organizations as they directly support
    the value streams. In BLAST, these are our value managers and value coaches. They
    are often referred to as the “glue” that holds companies together, bridging the
    gap between top management and lower-level workers.

- en: Scrum retrospectives focus on what the development team can directly influence
    in the forthcoming sprint, aiming for immediate, iterative improvements within
    the team’s local authority and scope. This approach works well in small team settings
    where the scope is limited to the team’s control. However, in large, multi-team
    settings, individual team improvements can lead to local optimization, overlooking
    the broader system needs. So, to recap, team-based retrospectives are beneficial
    for making the team more effective and adaptable but are limited in their capacity
    for broader, systemic changes due to a lack of visibility and authority over the
    entire value stream.
  id: totrans-217

    revenue, reduced costs, and improved quality.

    but miss more impactful changes that benefit the entire value stream. If changes

    Therefore, VSM practitioners always look for the constraints that hinder flows.

    work in the steps leading up to it. Meanwhile, subsequent activities lack work,
    awaiting input from the bottlenecked step. The key issue is that fixing the bottleneck
    in activity A4 is the primary concern. If another team spends time, money, and
    effort on reducing their cycle time to 30 seconds, it will be for nothing, as
    A4 is still the bottleneck. Even with their change, the other six activities cannot

    delivery of high-value features. However, the defining element of MVIs is that
    they represent the minimal value that customers expect to meet their needs, delivered
    in very granular slices. This granularity ensures that each increment is small
    enough to be quickly developed and deployed, allowing for frequent feedback and
    continuous improvement. This concept is consistent with Lean-oriented philosophies,
    which aim to eliminate waste and constraints on activities that customers do not
    value.

    Participating BLAST teams pull their work from the backlog in order of highest
    priority. Priorities are set based on customers’ needs and to ensure that necessary
    elements to support future value-based deliveries are properly sequenced. Teams
    that pull lower-priority MVIs engage in a form of local optimization, which may
    be due to preferences or skills, and this hinders the organization’s ability to
    efficiently deliver the entire increment of value. On the other hand, we cannot
    expect a marketing team to work on software development tasks. In BLAST, teams
    pull work items from a single Business Value Backlog. But segmentation within
    the backlog is necessary to coordinate disparate pieces of work across value streams
    for each release cycle.

    Iterative and Incremental Development (IID) model to establish a rapid development
    and delivery cadence, exemplified by the Sprints in Scrum. In contrast, Lean focuses
    on value stream flows, with a production goal to establish a cadence that matches
    takt time. The German word *takt* means pulse or beat, conceptually aiming to
    align production capacities with customer demands.

    of cadence. For instance, the Scrum Guide suggests a fixed length for Sprints
    of one month or less, emphasizing consistency in whatever length you choose. In
    contrast, Lean flows can vary significantly, being much quicker or longer depending
    on the size and complexity of the development effort. For example, tasks in a
    modern CI/CD line might be measured in seconds, minutes, or hours, while a Lean
    production line building large aircraft or ships might be measured in months to
    years. Moreover, in a Lean environment, takt time dynamically changes based on
    customer demands.

    recovery times that can stretch to an alarming six months. [16](B21818_08.xhtml#endnote-016)
    This gap underscores the differences between top-tier developers, who are well

    transformations, it’s pivotal to recalibrate our understanding of the purpose
    of sprints within Agile. As originally conceived, Scrum sprints do not map directly
    to the end-to-end development cycles typical of Lean-oriented product delivery
    flows. Instead, they serve a foundational role by providing a consistent cadence
    for teams to prioritize, plan, execute, and reflect on their work. This rhythm
    ensures that teams can align their efforts with business needs regularly, make
    necessary adjustments based on feedback, and deliver incremental value.

    and shaped by market demands and customer insights. Initially, we might be inundated
    with business and product ideas, but many might not see the light of day. Meanwhile,
    modern DevOps pipelines enhance software development and delivery capabilities
    through integrated toolchains and automation. Consequently, the gap between defining
    requirements and delivering on them has only broadened. The good news is that
    the BLAST approach clarifies the mechanisms to achieve an efficient software delivery
    ecosystem.

    phase* for products, services, or business-supporting processes, systems, and
    artifacts might brim with potential avenues to explore. However, factors such
    as time, resources, risks, and market dynamics will whittle down these options.
    Initially, we won’t know what products and services we need to deliver, nor the
    capabilities, features, and functions required. Everything is still fuzzy at this
    stage. Recognizing this uncertainty is essential to ensure a steady, productive
    supply to our DevOps pipelines.
  id: totrans-261
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To manage this flow of requirements effectively, we utilize different *planning
    horizons*. These horizons help us structure our approach to requirements assessment
    and refinement. Long-term planning horizons focus on aligning with corporate strategy
    and market demands, establishing high-level goals and objectives. Mid-term planning
    horizons translate these goals into tangible work items, prioritized within backlogs.
    Short-term planning horizons ensure that teams have well-defined, actionable tasks
    ready for development. This structured approach ensures that as ideas move through
    the funnel, they are continuously refined and aligned with strategic objectives,
    enhancing the efficiency of our delivery processes.
  id: totrans-262

    to supporting modern software delivery capabilities. Executives are constantly
    bombarded with investment ideas to support the business, but there are usually
    insufficient financial and human resources to pursue every request. Therefore,
    the organization needs a planning process to properly vet, prioritize, and fund
    the initiatives that drive the most value. This section fundamentally focuses
    on defining planning processes to support these vetting and refinement activities.
    Here, you will learn how to implement the multi-faceted rhythms that drive enterprises
    holistically across all domains. In a Lean-Agile context, we refer to these rhythms
    as **cadences**.

    client that was using Scrum effectively but couldn’t deliver quickly. Although
    the teams were working on the same product, they operated independently and only
    attempted integration every two weeks. This led to long final integration times.

    teams, it was quickly determined that a common backlog would create alignment
    and facilitate full integration after each sprint. The BLAST approach eliminated
    the need for extensive coordination, expedited integrations, and provided quick
    feedback across the teams.
