     While there can be legitimate reasons for a bespoke answer to a generic requirement – for instance, if you have a highly developed infrastructure for some capability that you want to leverage across all enterprise systems – not making a reasoned comparison with the available commercial options is an anti-pattern and goes against the core philosophy

     That’s to say, an anti-pattern arises when you don’t make a considered build-versus-buy decision for important but generic capabilities and instead reflexively embrace an in-house approach, whether because of the “not invented here” syndrome or because it’s cognitively easier to handle for your organization’s key stakeholders.

     are in general extremely non-technical, and one of the key requirements that the custom application had to satisfy was to never show a technical error message to an end user.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.2">
     Therefore, the developers of the original application devised a way to catch all exceptions and wrap them in a generic error message before they were shown to

    <span class="No-Break">

   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.1">
     This general message of telling users that an error has occurred in a friendly way is the main error message that’s seen in the system since the developers were unable or didn’t have sufficient time to differentiate the errors that might occur reasonably.

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.2">
     Users, however, seem comfortable enough with the solution and don’t enquire much about the exact nature of the errors that

     She starts by reviewing the logs that she can generate from the production system but finds that the only errors she can see are the generic error messages that are thrown by the wrapping mechanism that hides the technical information from the users.

     This means the production logs are, effectively, of no use to her debugging efforts.
