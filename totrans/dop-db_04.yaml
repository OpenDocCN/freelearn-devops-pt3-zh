    migration strategy. This model involves moving an application from an on-premises
    infrastructure to a cloud infrastructure without making any changes to the application

    for a lift-and-shift migration to transition seamlessly to cloud infrastructure
    without disrupting its critical daily operations. By moving such applications

    to take advantage of the full potential of cloud computing. If the business has
    the budget and time, it may be more beneficial to re-architect the application
    to take advantage of cloud-native services, such as serverless computing, containers,
    and microservices. This can provide greater cost savings, agility, and performance
    optimization.

    the application is not a good fit for the cloud infrastructure. For example, if

- en: In conclusion, lift-and-shift migration is a popular cloud migration strategy
    that involves moving an application to the cloud without making any changes to
    the application architecture. This model can provide cost savings, scalability,
    and high availability for businesses that have legacy applications that are tightly
    coupled with the underlying infrastructure. However, lift-and-shift migration
    may not provide significant cost savings in the long run and may not provide businesses
    with the agility and performance optimization that they need. Businesses should
    carefully evaluate their application and infrastructure requirements before deciding
    to perform a lift-and-shift migration.

    to a cloud-based database. This migration process can be complex, and it requires
    careful planning and execution to ensure that the data is migrated accurately
    and with minimal disruption to the business. One critical aspect of the migration
    process is the data migration strategy. In this section, we’ll discuss the various

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Big Bang migration strategy is a data migration approach that involves moving
    all data from a legacy system to a new system in a single, comprehensive transfer.
    This method is often used when the legacy system is no longer sustainable, and
    there is a pressing need to migrate all data to a new system quickly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key advantage of the Big Bang strategy is that it minimizes the risk of
    data discrepancies or inconsistencies that can occur when migrating data in stages.
    Since all data is moved at once, there is less opportunity for data loss, duplication,
    or corruption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, this approach presents several challenges that organizations should
    be aware of before deciding to adopt it. The biggest challenge is the potential
    for downtime or service disruption during the migration process. If data transfer
    encounters unexpected problems, this could lead to system downtime, loss of productivity,
    and a potential loss of revenue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To mitigate the risk of downtime, organizations must carefully plan, test, and
    coordinate the migration process to ensure that all data is transferred correctly,
    and the new system is fully functional after migration. It is essential to establish
    clear communication channels, document procedures, and allocate resources to ensure
    that the migration process goes smoothly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another potential challenge of the Big Bang approach is that it can be more
    complex and expensive than other migration strategies. Since all data is moved
    at once, the process requires careful planning and execution to ensure that data
    is correctly transferred, and the new system is fully functional after migration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, the Big Bang migration strategy is a data migration approach that
    involves transferring all data from a legacy system to a new system in a single,
    comprehensive transfer. While it can offer advantages in terms of reduced risk
    of data discrepancies, it also presents challenges such as potential downtime
    and higher costs. Organizations should carefully consider the trade-offs before
    deciding whether this approach is the best fit for their migration needs.

    too disruptive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
