			<p><st c="1483">This chapter does not require any specific technical prerequisites. </st><st c="1552">We will introduce you to the Microsoft Power Platform services and administrative configuration options, which you can follow along by using your workstation with a modern internet browser and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1745">internet connectivity.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="1767">In this chapter, we will use a set of trial Microsoft Power Platform licenses in order to create a Power Platform environment, which you can then continue to use to test Microsoft Power </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1954">Platform services.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="1972">Should you already have your own Microsoft Power Platform environment, feel free to use it to follow along with the chapter, and more importantly, use it in the following chapters, which will have more hands-on exercises. </st><st c="2195">We recommend creating a separate Power Platform environment for the work done in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2276">this book.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/><st c="2286">The rise of low-code/no-code</st></h1>
			<p><st c="2315">In this</st><a id="_idIndexMarker163"/><st c="2323"> section, we will take a look at the concept of </st><strong class="bold"><st c="2371">low-code</st></strong><st c="2379">/</st><strong class="bold"><st c="2381">no-code</st></strong><st c="2388"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="2390">LCNC</st></strong><st c="2394">) development and explore why there is a growing demand on the market to adopt this approach and its associated tools. </st><st c="2514">By doing so, we will gain insights into the significance of this application development approach and where it is heading in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2639">the future.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="2650">LCNC is an application development method that allows application makers to create software applications with less or no coding and in a shorter amount of time, supported by a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="2827">software-as-a-service</st></strong><st c="2848"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="2850">SaaS</st></strong><st c="2854">) platform that </st><a id="_idIndexMarker164"/><st c="2871">abstracts the complexities related to scaling, data management, and so on. </st><st c="2946">Even though we often come across </st><em class="italic"><st c="2979">LCNC</st></em><st c="2983"> as a complete term, there are some differences between LC </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3042">and NC.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="3049">An LC development approach will still require application makers to have at least a fundamental knowledge of software development, since some portion of the application could still use code to support a business logic or a certain function. </st><st c="3291">This allows us to build software applications that are more sophisticated and complex, compared to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3390">NC applications.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="3406">In today’s era of </st><strong class="bold"><st c="3425">artificial intelligence</st></strong><st c="3448"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="3450">AI</st></strong><st c="3452">) and AI assistants, such as Microsoft’s Copilots, which help us to be more productive with tools by only using natural language instructions, we can also get from them complete code by only providing them with a prompt in a natural language. </st><st c="3696">This reduces the gap between the LC and NC development approach. </st><st c="3761">However, these AI assistants are called Copilot for a reason, and this is due to the fact that users still need to understand the received suggestions to validate whether they will perform what was instructed. </st><st c="3971">Our last chapter in the book will cover Microsoft’s Copilots, especially Copilots for Power Platform services, which will help us learn more about how to benefit </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4133">from them.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="4143">The NC development approach focuses on the use of visual tools to visually build applications through drag and drop capabilities, allowing simple customizations, such as attribute and property configurations. </st><st c="4353">Using such an approach means that we are more limited with the customizations; conversely, we do not require any prior knowledge of software development. </st><st c="4507">This allows almost anyone in an organization to become an application maker. </st><st c="4584">The NC approach can also be used to quickly prototype applications, which are then handed over to pro-developers or application makers with LC experience to extend the application with more </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4774">complex logic.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="4788">Many platforms, including Microsoft Power Platform, combine both development approaches, thus giving an organization the possibility to choose an approach based on the project/application and the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4985">available resources.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="5005">LCNC</st><a id="_idIndexMarker165"/><st c="5010"> application development approach is not something new. </st><st c="5066">LCNC development platforms can trace their roots back to the 1980s. </st><st c="5134">Microsoft Excel, the fourth-generation programming languages, and the rapid application development tools all played significant roles in the development of Microsoft Power Platform. </st><strong class="bold"><st c="5317">Fourth-generation languages</st></strong><st c="5344"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="5346">4GLs</st></strong><st c="5350">) were </st><a id="_idIndexMarker166"/><st c="5358">actually designed with someone who is not strictly a software developer in mind, as the programming language is simplified and requires fewer commands to operate, compared to the other </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5543">programming languages.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="5565">Even though there are many tools available on the market to enable users to build their applications and websites with the NC approach, the rich and extensive history of Microsoft tools, such as Microsoft Excel, Access, and other business productivity tools, have played an important part in creating LCNC development platforms as we know </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5905">them today.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="5916">The idea behind the LCNC development approach is to offer non-developers, business analysts, and business users a platform that they could use with the knowledge that they already have. </st><st c="6103">Since many users already know how to use Microsoft tools such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft PowerPoint, they can easily learn how to use Microsoft Power Platform, which is like a combination of these products. </st><st c="6333">This allows anyone to create business applications faster, without or with little code writing. </st><st c="6429">Interestingly, even the code-writing part follows the same pattern and matches the experience of </st><a id="_idIndexMarker167"/><st c="6526">formula writing in Microsoft Excel, which reinforces the theory of a connected experience across </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6623">Microsoft tools.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/><st c="6639">The current and the future state of LCNC development</st></h2>
			<p><st c="6692">With the rapid pace</st><a id="_idIndexMarker168"/><st c="6712"> of work and a constant urge to digitalize their operations, many companies seek ways to do more in less time, with tools that can be used not only by traditional software developers but also by other employees. </st><st c="6924">Anyone with the determination to develop new applications and digitalize and optimize business processes can become an application maker and build applications, automation workflows, and chatbots that support business operations. </st><st c="7154">This idea that everyone can be a developer has fueled the adoption of LCNC tools. </st><st c="7236">However, there are also other reasons why we have seen such an increase in the adoption of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7327">these tools.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7339">Over the past five years, there has been a significant increase in interest in LC development platforms worldwide. </st><st c="7455">The biggest milestone that impacted this rise and pushed organizations to accelerate their digital transformation was definitely the COVID-19 pandemic. </st><st c="7607">During the global pandemic, organizations rushed to find ways to quickly adapt to changing market needs and digitalize their operations. </st><st c="7744">This called for the faster development of business applications, which </st><em class="italic"><st c="7815">increased the demand for skilled professional developers</st></em><span class="Annotation-reference"><st c="7871">.</st></span><st c="7872"> However, as an outcome, this led to a shortage of professional developers on </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7950">the market.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7961">In 2022, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted a 25% growth in application development and quality assurance testing demand in the next 10 years, which is much faster than the average for all occupations, as mentioned in their report. </st><st c="8214">Companies can now bridge the gap of the professional developer shortage by acquiring LC developers or training their business users to become </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8356">app makers.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8367">According to Gartner, the LC development technology market will grow even further. </st><st c="8451">Based on the 2022 market research, LC application platforms are projected to be the largest component of </st><a id="_idIndexMarker169"/><st c="8556">the LC development technology market in 2024, growing to reach nearly $12.3 billion </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8640">in revenue.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8651">In our discussion of</st><a id="_idIndexMarker170"/><st c="8672"> LC development tools, you would be forgiven for thinking that this addresses only the area of software application development; however, we should not overlook the rising trend of interest in </st><em class="italic"><st c="8865">hyperautomation</st></em><st c="8880">. This is </st><a id="_idIndexMarker171"/><st c="8890">an area that covers different technologies, including </st><strong class="bold"><st c="8944">Robotic Process Automation</st></strong><st c="8970"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="8972">RPA</st></strong><st c="8975">) and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="8982">Digital Process Automation</st></strong><st c="9008"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="9010">DPA</st></strong><st c="9013">), which</st><a id="_idIndexMarker172"/><st c="9022"> help organizations</st><a id="_idIndexMarker173"/><st c="9041"> mitigate the high demand to digitize their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9085">business operations.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9105">Again, AI assistants, such as Microsoft Copilot, can help increase the adoption of LCNC tools. </st><st c="9201">With only natural language, app makers can turn their ideas into fully </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9272">functional applications.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/><st c="9296">Understanding the benefits of LCNC</st></h2>
			<p><st c="9331">LCNC development</st><a id="_idIndexMarker174"/><st c="9348"> approach offers several benefits to organizations. </st><st c="9400">One of the biggest benefits is that practically anyone can be an app maker, no matter what their software developing skills are, which helps to close the pro-developer gap. </st><st c="9573">Those who have no experience in software development and prefer visual experience for application development can leverage the NC approach, while others who have some software development skills or experience in writing formulas can benefit from the LC approach, where app makers can focus on the business logic for a given business application, rather than focusing on the underlying source code of the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9977">software application.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9998">Such a development approach can help organizations to save time and money, by helping them to build custom software applications faster and more easily with fewer resources, while having their applications powered by the SaaS platform, which provides security, scalability, governance, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10289">data management.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="10305">Lastly, we cannot ignore the fact that LCNC development tools offer great integration possibilities with first- and third-party tools, which leads to faster development of software applications with integration between different systems, applications, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10558">and services.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/><st c="10571">Getting started with Microsoft Power Platform services</st></h1>
			<p><st c="10626">This section will describe what Microsoft Power Platform is and its basic components. </st><st c="10713">We will explain how these tools empower users to create business applications, automate processes, and even gain insights into data. </st><st c="10846">We will also explain how to create your own Power Platform trial account to create an environment that can be used to test the capabilities of the platform, as well as help you follow along with the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11045">following chapters.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/><st c="11064">What is Microsoft Power Platform?</st></h2>
			<p><st c="11098">Microsoft’s approach to LCNC </st><a id="_idIndexMarker175"/><st c="11128">development is not limited to a single tool; rather, it offers a user </st><strong class="bold"><st c="11198">a suite of tools</st></strong><st c="11214"> that span across different focus areas, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="11255">allowing users to use them either individually or in combination to build an end-to-end </st></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><st c="11343">business solution</st></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="11360">.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="11799">Having a </st><a id="_idIndexMarker177"/><st c="11809">diverse range of products in the LCNC portfolio enables users to build business solutions in a flexible and modular way. </st><st c="11930">These tools not only provide native integration with other Microsoft products but also empower users to build solutions </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12050">more effectively.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="12067">With this, users also have the flexibility to license only the products they use, as Microsoft Power Platform services are licensed individually. </st><st c="12214">Licenses can be either standalone, such as a Power Apps Premium license, or come included with </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12309">another license.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="12325">As an example of having an inclusive license, some Microsoft products (such as Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365) entitle you to use a limited set of features from selected Microsoft </st><a id="_idIndexMarker178"/><st c="12505">Power Platform services. </st><st c="12530">Such an encapsulated license type is called a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="12576">seeded license</st></strong><st c="12590">. For example, a license for Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 includes a limited set of capabilities for Power Apps and Power Automate. </st><st c="12716">To enable all Premium capabilities for Power Apps and Power Automate, a separate Premium license for these services should be purchased and used. </st><st c="12862">Mostly, the licenses use a per-user subscription model; however, other </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12933">variations apply.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="12950">Important note</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="12965">While this book doesn’t delve into the licensing details, we encourage everyone to explore the various licensing models available on the Microsoft websites, as Microsoft Power Platform licensing undergoes regular updates, making it a highly dynamic topic. </st><st c="13222">Administrators and DevOps engineers should incorporate regular checks for any changes as an integral part of their responsibilities. </st><st c="13355">Staying informed ensures effective management and compliance within the Power </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13433">Platform ecosystem.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="13683">In October 2016, Microsoft released the generally available Power Apps and Flow (today known as Power Automate), and today, we have a very mature platform, which for five years in a row been named by Gartner as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant</st><span class="superscript"><st c="13933">TM</st></span><st c="13936"> for Enterprise LC </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13955">Application Platforms.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="13977">Although the platform primarily targets citizen developers, it enables you to build integration scenarios and is extensible, making it suitable even for professional developers (for example, building custom connectors through a published custom API in Azure API Management, developing code controls using the Power Apps component framework, and publishing custom models with </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14353">AI Builder).</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="14365">Next, let’s take a look at the Microsoft Power Platform </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14422">family members.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="14437">Power Apps</st></h3>
			<p><st c="14448">Power Apps is a</st><a id="_idIndexMarker180"/><st c="14464"> product that allows users to create and run custom business applications. </st><st c="14539">Applications can be rapidly developed without extensive coding, by using Visual Maker Studio and drag and drop capability. </st><st c="14662">Pro-developers and app makers can create applications that connect to various data sources and integrate with many existing applications and services through connectors. </st><st c="14832">Applications can be developed as a canvas application, where the focus is more on the design and custom interfaces, or a model-driven application, with the focus on the data model. </st><st c="15013">An interesting aspect of canvas applications is that this type of application can be wrapped as a native mobile app package, which will resemble custom Android and iOS applications. </st><st c="15195">They can be then distributed to mobile end users through Google Play Store, Apple </st><a id="_idIndexMarker181"/><st c="15277">Business Manager, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="15327">App Center.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="15338">Power Automate</st></h3>
			<p><st c="15353">Power Automate is a </st><a id="_idIndexMarker182"/><st c="15374">cloud-based workflow service that helps customers address hyperautomation. </st><st c="15449">It goes beyond building workflows that automate simple day-to-day repetitive tasks, all the way to automatizing very complex business processes across various services and systems. </st><st c="15630">If you already use </st><strong class="bold"><st c="15649">application programming interfaces</st></strong><st c="15683"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="15685">APIs</st></strong><st c="15689">) to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker183"/><st c="15695">access some of your backend services, then </st><strong class="bold"><st c="15738">digital process automation</st></strong><st c="15764"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="15766">DPA</st></strong><st c="15769">) can be covered by Power Automate. </st><st c="15806">If you want to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker184"/><st c="15821">automate repetitive tasks performed in a desktop application or build web automation through RPA, Power Automate is here to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="15945">support you.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="15957">Copilot Studio</st></h3>
			<p><st c="15972">Copilot Studio is a</st><a id="_idIndexMarker185"/><st c="15992"> platform that builds standalone copilots. </st><st c="16035">It is built on the foundations of Power Virtual Agents, a platform to build intelligent virtual agents and chatbots. </st><st c="16152">Copilot Studio allows us to build custom copilots by building the topics that control the flow of conversation or keep it more dynamic, with the help of </st><strong class="bold"><st c="16305">Large Language Models</st></strong><st c="16326"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="16328">LLMs</st></strong><st c="16332">), such as </st><a id="_idIndexMarker186"/><st c="16344">GPT. </st><st c="16349">Custom copilots help users perform tasks or receive answers to questions. </st><st c="16423">They can be connected to organizational data, which serves as a knowledge base, and backend systems through connectors and plugins to resolve complex tasks. </st><st c="16580">Copilots can be published through different channels, such as websites, custom mobile/web applications, or any other service used for communication, such as Facebook, Slack, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="16754">or Twilio.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="16764">Power Pages</st></h3>
			<p><st c="16776">Power Pages is an </st><a id="_idIndexMarker187"/><st c="16795">enterprise-grade, scalable, and secure cloud-based service for building rich and data-driven websites. </st><st c="16898">It relies extensively on Dataverse to store configurations as well as data, which is represented on websites. </st><st c="17008">Even though it’s one of the youngest members of the Power Platform family, Power Pages has had quite a journey in evolving into the product that it’s known as today. </st><st c="17174">It started with Microsoft’s acquisition of Adxstudio Inc., then it became Power Apps Portals, and today, we </st><a id="_idIndexMarker188"/><st c="17282">have Power Pages. </st><st c="17300">Its core has stayed the same – a platform to allow users to create, host, and manage modern and visually appealing websites, with data at </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="17438">the center.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="17449">Power BI</st></h3>
			<p><st c="17458">While other products from</st><a id="_idIndexMarker189"/><st c="17484"> the Power Platform family are intended to automatize business processes and build business applications, Power BI is a set of tools that allow us to gain insights into data and build intelligent reports, enabling us to quickly extract the key information from the data. </st><st c="17755">Dashboards and reports can be built following the same LCNC approach used for business application development. </st><st c="17867">By using a drag and drop experience, we can connect various data sources and build charts and tiles that represent the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="17986">extracted data.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="18001">Power Platform’s extended ecosystem</st></h3>

			<h3><st c="18372">Dataverse</st></h3>
			<p><st c="18382">Dataverse is a</st><a id="_idIndexMarker190"/><st c="18397"> secure and scalable cloud data store that is used across Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. </st><st c="18488">It allows us to create new tables that will be consumed by our business applications and apply strict security models and governance policies on them, such as permissions, column-based security, and auditing capabilities. </st><st c="18710">It allows us to create views and forms over tables in Dataverse, that can then be used to rapidly build applications on top of the data model. </st><st c="18853">Dataverse allows us also to build business process flows that define how data flows through its life cycle and what the business rules are that apply to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="19006">a table.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="19014">Power Fx</st></h3>
			<p><st c="19023">Power Fx is a </st><a id="_idIndexMarker191"/><st c="19038">general-purpose LC language used across Microsoft Power Platform. </st><st c="19104">What started originally in Power Apps is now spread across other Power Platform services, providing a unified experience to build formulas. </st><st c="19244">Power Fx is used to build custom logic in business solutions. </st><st c="19306">With its spreadsheet-like formulas and resemblance to Microsoft Excel, it facilitates a rapid adoption rate. </st><st c="19415">Power Fx is open source, which </st><a id="_idIndexMarker192"/><st c="19446">allows for greater transparency and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="19482">community collaboration.</st></span></p>
			<h3><st c="19506">Connectors</st></h3>
			<p><st c="19517">Connectors </st><a id="_idIndexMarker193"/><st c="19529">play a crucial role in the Microsoft Power Platform ecosystem. </st><st c="19592">They act as an integration bridge between Power Platform and external services or data sources. </st><st c="19688">Each connector comes with its own set of triggers and actions. </st><st c="19751">From a licensing perspective, they are divided into standard and premium connectors, but from a technological perspective, they are divided into groups of prebuilt (connecting to first- or third-party services) and custom connectors. </st><st c="19985">We will dive deeper into connectors in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="20024">future chapters.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="69063">As with the templates mentioned in the previous section, the idea of enterprise templates is to reduce the time needed to build apps around certain cases in an organization. </st><st c="69238">We can use them also to learn how a specific scenario can be developed using Power </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="69321">Platform services.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="69339">Each of these templates comes with two applications; one is a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="69402">canvas</st></strong><st c="69408"> application</st><a id="_idIndexMarker282"/><st c="69420"> that is intended for end users. </st><st c="69453">It is a UI-rich application that either has a responsive layout or is adapted for mobile devices, so it can also be used on the go. </st><st c="69585">The second application is </st><strong class="bold"><st c="69611">model-driven</st></strong><st c="69623"> and is</st><a id="_idIndexMarker283"/><st c="69630"> intended for admins. </st><st c="69652">It is a </st><em class="italic"><st c="69660">data-intense</st></em><st c="69672"> application, where administrators can apply admin operations to the data or the back-office team can manage all the entries in the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="69804">data source.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="69816">Applications also use Dataverse as the data source, where one or more tables are created and used to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="69918">store data.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="69929">On top of everything, Power Automate flows are generated, which perform some business operations based on </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="70036">the project.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="70048">This is a very common way to develop applications in Power Apps, with the process supported by Power Automate, while data stays in Dataverse where security roles can be applied to further protect access to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="70255">the data.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="73615">Power Platform project </st><a id="_idIndexMarker285"/><st c="73639">development consists of phases such as project planning, designing, developing, testing, and deploying. </st><st c="73743">Since developing a Power Platform project follows an agile methodology, it is an iterative and repeatable process. </st><st c="73858">This approach means that once we deploy our solution, we can easily return to the initial phases of the project development, where we design and develop new versions of our application. </st><st c="74044">In the next chapters, we will take a look at how we can follow the ALM of our business applications and solutions; however, it’s worth mentioning that many of the projects that are built on Power Platform follow a similar pattern. </st><st c="74275">These are patterns such as approvals, asset management, and inspection applications. </st><st c="74360">Microsoft has combined them and created a list of all identified Power Platform patterns, including the template solutions for each pattern and the documentation on </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="74525">the installation.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="74664">Each pattern has its own purpose; however, from a technology perspective, it is common for them to consist of one or more Power Apps applications, central data storage, such as Dataverse, a SQL database, or SharePoint Online, and Power Automate flows to support the business process. </st><st c="74949">Some patterns include Power Pages for the user frontend experience, instead of a Power </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="75036">Apps application.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="78547">In 2020, Microsoft claimed that 97% of Fortune 500 companies used Microsoft Power Platform in many ways. </st><st c="78653">For sure, we can see that the platform is gaining popularity, which is why we believe that more and more real-life world cases will be documented and shared with the wider community, allowing people to learn from them and implement them to solve their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="78905">own challenges.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="78920">Although not all customer stories are publicly available, those that are give us great insights into what made the customer decide to use the technology, and we can also read about how they </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="79111">implemented solutions.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/><st c="79133">Summary</st></h1>
			<p><st c="79141">This chapter covered the rise of the LCNC development approach and how it has gained traction in recent years. </st><st c="79253">We hope this chapter helped you understand why it is important to be aware of this development approach, what its benefits are, and how it is different from the classic software </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="79431">development approach.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="79452">We briefly explained the key family members of the Power Platform and focused on how to open your trial account. </st><st c="79566">This should help you understand how to start using the platform, as the following chapters will focus on a hands-on activity, and it’s important to have a test environment prepared to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="79750">follow along.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="79763">Next, we covered the tools to administer the Power Platform, from the admin center to different CLI tools, with PAC CLI being the preferred one, and various connectors that can help automate management tasks. </st><st c="79973">No matter whether you are an IT administrator, DevOps engineer, or professional developer, there is a good chance that you will use one or more of these tools with Power Platform while developing or managing </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="80181">your solutions.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="80196">The last two sections in this chapter focused on understanding how the platform is kept secure and compliant with different standards and regulations, as well as how to make use of the various templates and patterns that are published on Microsoft public sites. </st><st c="80459">This should help you gain trust in the platform and speed up your initial project, set up using the available templates (at least for the first </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="80603">few projects).</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="80617">In the next chapter, we will use our knowledge of Power Platform and try to connect it with why ALM and DevOps are important for Power Platform projects. </st><st c="80772">We will also delve into the Power Platform adoption maturity model and how it is helping organizations to assess their current maturity level and improve </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="80926">DevOps processes.</st></span></p>
