<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">When DevOps deliverables are used to define success, it can be difficult to get executive buy-in and budgetary support. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">This is particularly true if senior managers don’t understand the true value that DevOps brings to their customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">Instead, executives might mistake DevOps as being a drain on profits, seeking justification for its existence rather than viewing it as a value multiplier and long-term strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">In this case, executives might attempt to reduce investment in your team, instead of helping you increase the capacity that is needed to improve the customer experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.5">Therefore, DevOps leaders must establish a culture of DevOps and define success in terms of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">customer-centric outcomes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Building a DevOps culture requires thorough planning and a unified approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Start by getting buy-in from executive leadership, then form a DevOps team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">Once your team has been established, gradually define processes and foster a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Don’t forget to provide training and support and to celebrate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">successful outcomes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">In this chapter, you will learn about the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">following topics:</span></span></p>
<ul>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">At some point in the evolution of DevOps, and seemingly out of nowhere, we have become a culture that cost-justifies everything. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">In doing so, we violate the classic axiom that you can only ever satisfy two of three constraints: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">scope (quality)</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">time (speed)</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">, and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">cost (low cost)</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">This is known as </span><a id="_idIndexMarker662"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">project management triangle</span></strong><em class="italic"> </em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">the triple constraint</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">, which</span><a id="_idIndexMarker663"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1"> suggests that any change in one of these three constraints will inevitably affect the others; you will have to pick two of them and compromise on the third. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">All too often, we introduce some new tool and attempt to persuade others about how it will speed things up, result in cost savings, or free up our time for more meaningful tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Then, we’d discover how this new tool could improve quality if we extended it by adding yet another new feature or capability with the promise that it would yield a more reliable process compared to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">existing one:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">These arguments are easy to win in most technology companies by multiplying the calculated savings across the number of team members that it would aid. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">However, discovering the truth about how effective a change will be is a lagging indicator as it is exceedingly difficult to predict the outcomes of a new process against real-world conditions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">It is for this very reason that continuous experimentation and continuous learning are encouraged in DevOps culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">Sometimes, you never really know if a new change will work out without first putting it through its paces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">The key, of course, is knowing precisely when a new change is not working out and that it is time to change course; consider it both an art and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">a science!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Nevertheless, it is easy to produce a narrative about how large the potential benefit can be to justify the costs of implementing a new tool. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">The reality is that you can’t gain a single ounce of competitive advantage from these investments because your competitor can make the same investments as you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">In this context, any perceived gains that you think you are making are, in reality, not sustainable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">Instead, you are just holding the line by remaining peers with your competition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.5">Sadly, the decisions for these kinds of investments are frequently made by upper management in isolation from the rest of the team, and often with a narrow set of interests in mind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.6">In these scenarios, developers get thrown under the bus in favor of perceived </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">cost-cutting measures.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Now that we have underscored the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker664"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">meaning of the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">triple constraint</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1"> and its impact on software development, let’s discuss some strategies that will help you cope with balancing the competing priorities of quality, speed, and cost. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Let’s begin by focusing on the single most important aspect of creating new </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">software: quality.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Never compromise on quality</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">As a result of the current </span><a id="_idIndexMarker665"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">state of affairs in the world, there is a greater demand than ever before for businesses to cut their expenses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">Given that budgetary limitations significantly influence the decision-making process of most leaders, the remaining factors that are up for negotiation are the quality of the product (or service) or the velocity of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">the product.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Based on customer expectations in a tremendously competitive market, you shouldn’t compromise on quality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">When you relax the standard of quality, it will not only harm the product’s image and overall reliability, but it will also come back to haunt you in the form of additional costs down the line – particularly during the maintenance phase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">Simply put, any cost that you avoid upfront by skimping on quality and not putting in the time to carefully engineer your product will come back to threaten the success of your products and services in the future – potentially by orders of magnitude. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.4">Now that I have made myself clear, we, as professionals, must deliver high-quality products and services under tight financial constraints. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.5">This leaves us with the last option out of the three: </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">velocity (speed).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">It becomes evident that achieving optimal</span><a id="_idIndexMarker666"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> velocity and a high standard for excellence relies heavily on how well your team aligns with your business objectives and the known requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">At this point, it should be apparent that achieving both goals at their greatest potential is not practical. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">However, you have the opportunity to create an acceptable balance without completely undermining one or the other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">As previously emphasized, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">quality assurance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">QA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">) testing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker667"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> is crucial in achieving your desired equilibrium between these competing priorities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">By implementing QA and software testing alongside DevOps release management, you can achieve quicker market penetration while optimizing the value of your product. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">Therefore, it is essential to seamlessly incorporate automated quality assurance methods throughout the entirety of the SDLC to ensure they are always given proper attention. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">As your company grows, strive for continuous testing to significantly improve the merit of your products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.5">This will not only delight your customers – it also will sustain their loyalty to your business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.6">Efficiency allows for quick market entry, but ensuring high standards guarantees lasting success and customer contentment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.7">Spend some time discovering the perfect balance for your organization’s distinct requirements and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">sustained profitability.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Here are some points that will make achieving this goal </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">more successful:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">When initiating a project, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive plan for </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">QA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1"> right from the beginning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">This proactive approach ensures that the necessary resources are in place to effectively assess and validate the project’s deliverables. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">When incorporating QA planning into the project’s initial stages, it is advisable to refrain from neglecting best practices without </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">valid reasons.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Test automation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1"> is a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker668"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">valuable practice, especially when it comes to the execution of regression testing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">By employing test automation, software development teams can allocate their time to the creation of new features, while automated testing handles the process of verifying the existing ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">This approach ensures that previously implemented features remain intact and functional throughout </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">the SDLC.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Parallel testing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker669"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">a technique that involves running scripts simultaneously rather than sequentially. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">This approach can greatly decrease the duration required to perform various types of tests, including unit, smoke, regression, and cross-browser tests. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">By leveraging parallel testing solutions, organizations can optimize their testing processes and achieve faster and more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">efficient results.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Paired programming</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">, also known as </span><a id="_idIndexMarker670"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">pair programming, is a collaborative software development technique where two programmers work together on the same task at the same workstation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">This approach differs from traditional code reviews, which typically involve one programmer reviewing another programmer’s code after it has been written. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">This approach aims to enhance productivity and efficiency by leveraging the strengths and expertise of both individuals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.4">By working in tandem, programmers can achieve the same benefits as traditional solo programming in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">reduced timeframe.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Test-driven development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">TDD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">) is a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker671"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">software development approach that offers a viable solution for reducing time to market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">By shifting the testing process from a post-development activity to an integral part of the development phase, TDD presents itself as a beneficial alternative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">This methodology emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code, ensuring that the code meets the specified requirements and passes the tests. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.4">By adopting TDD, developers can streamline the development process, identify and rectify issues early on, and ultimately expedite the time it takes to bring a product </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">to market.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">By using these recommendations, your project can effectively reconcile the conflicting objectives of low cost, speed, and quality, thereby transcending the divide between these two factors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">Naturally, you must consider the overall impact on your project at the beginning phases of your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">project planning.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Project timelines are ne</span><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">gotiable</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">In the majority of cases, project timelines</span><a id="_idIndexMarker672"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> are subject to negotiation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">Customer expectations, market pressure, internal financial goals, and benchmarking against competitors are common sources of unreasonable deadlines; in certain instances, the entirety of them may be affected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">By ensuring proper alignment of expectations, the process of project or improvement plan scheduling and organization becomes more streamlined. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">This enables the potential to deliver desired outcomes in half the time, without necessitating a doubling of the initial projected cost for the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.5">Optimize your approach to this challenge by determining the ideal timeframe for delivering a project of superior quality while also adhering to a constrained velocity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.6">This can have multiple interpretations that are beyond the scope of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">this book.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">However, when implementing this balance, there will inevitably be certain trade-offs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">In some cases, it may impede the product teams’ ability to deliver in frequent and rapid iterations, tailored to meet precise customer requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">Furthermore, reconciling speed with quality will limit the team’s ability to swiftly prioritize shifting requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.4">A common issue lies with the use of larger queues, which can result in the accumulation of expanding and hidden technical debt related to the management of backlogs, opportunity costs, and heightened complexity, among other factors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.5">Nevertheless, in this scenario there is still hope, through the process of streamlining the operational framework, it becomes evident that the primary constraint impacting team efficiency is the size of the queue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.6">The following phase requires that you investigate methods, such as Kanban, to enhance the area where the bottleneck exists. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.7">The goal is to increase scalability while adhering to the previously elucidated constraints of quality and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">low cost.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">The problem of perception in DevOps</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">When asked, many tech</span><a id="_idIndexMarker673"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1"> executives will admit that they are disappointed with the progress of their DevOps release management initiative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">In this scenario, they are spending at least 15% or more of their engineering budgets on things that are nongermane to their central business model and they are not seeing sufficient justification for the expense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">The reason that these executives invested in a DevOps transformation in the first place is to improve innovation, distinctiveness, and competitive advantage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.4">Another negative influence on this perception is that it is not clear to most business executives why DevOps is so difficult to understand or why it costs so much </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">to implement.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Upon further </span><a id="_idIndexMarker674"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">investigation, a trained eye can quickly determine that there is no real problem with DevOps in and of itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">In other words, a combination of factors limits the realization of business value for these executives’ investments in DevOps tools, along with the productivity of their software and DevOps engineers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">These elements include velocity, cost, staffing, and perception. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">This is where key performance metrics such as deployment frequency, lead time, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">mean time to recovery</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">MTTR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">), defect rate, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker675"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">customer satisfaction help measure the impact of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">DevOps practices.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">When it comes to velocity, ironically enough, DevOps is sometimes seen as the bottleneck that slows down software development and impacts operations teams that are simply striving to keep pace with customer demand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">Multiple factors affect the flow of productivity for those efforts, but in too many cases, poor visibility into the progress or real-world outcomes is the primary cause of perceived delays. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.3">To boost delivery velocity, teams must first gain visibility into their DevOps performance by collecting data and metrics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.4">With improved visibility, teams may compare their performance to that of other teams or organizations in the market, with the ultimate goal of identifying inefficiencies in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">delivery pipeline.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Regarding expenses, the total operating costs associated with deploying a cloud application sometimes does not fulfill executives’ expectations that embracing DevOps will lead to improved efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">If DevOps accounts for more than a quarter of the budget, DevOps will probably be attributed with at least a portion of the divergence between projected and actual expenses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">The reason for this is that when DevOps teams allocate a substantial portion of their precious time to putting out fires or manually building and updating deployment environments, they are unable to effectively optimize costs or mitigate emerging issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.4">This is due to the lack of time available to accomplish both tasks concurrently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.5">To optimize the development effort, it is advisable to invest in robust DevOps practices that facilitate the streamlining of operations, particularly through the incorporation of automation whenever feasible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.6">This will aid in addressing the expenses and intricacy associated with enforcing and administering </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">those protocols.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">The cost of employing your team is yet another factor to consider while developing your strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">Due to the high cost and scarcity of qualified DevOps technologists, it may be difficult to quickly expand a team to meet increasing demand in a short period. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">Investing in recruitment efforts and the opportunity for upward mobility is essential, even for firms that are privileged to have qualified DevOps staff on hand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.4">In addition, these businesses generally have to deal with a high rate of staff turnover, making it necessary for a greater number of inexperienced workers to respond to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">consumer requests.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">The public’s impression of your business, products, and services should be yet another consideration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">Many company executives have the misconception that developing and releasing cloud-native applications should be more straightforward, less time-consuming, and inexpensive than it truly is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">Software developers, consumers, and company executives might develop this impression due to a lack of experience with DevOps release management practices, particularly if they observe how respected companies such as Google, Capitol One, and Etsy approach the delivery of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">cloud-native applications.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">Almost everyone </span><a id="_idIndexMarker676"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">seems to assume that delivering software applications in the cloud will be easy, but few understand how much work goes into making cloud software distribution as simple and automated as the famed FAANG-Stock companies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">However, virtually all smaller </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">Software-as-a-Service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">SaaS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">) providers</span><a id="_idIndexMarker677"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1"> will never have the capital required to make investments of the same magnitude as those bigger players. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">Nonetheless, innovative products and services that supply groundbreaking potential will become less expensive and easier to implement and will come to market from time to time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">Every day, new and revolutionary solutions are created, such as Kubernetes, to radically empower </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">all stakeholders.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">The CALMS model places significant emphasis on the fundamental purpose of technology, which is to achieve desired outcomes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">It highlights the notion that technology should be employed solely to bolster and facilitate the operations of a business, rather than being adopted merely for the sake of being up-to-date with the latest technological advancements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">Initiating collaboration between business, development, and IT operations teams during the early stages of a DevOps transition is crucial for garnering widespread support for the implementation of new project management and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">delivery practices.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">To secure funding and support for ongoing projects that will pay off in the long run, this type of collaboration needs to be founded on nontechnical conversations with business teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">The technical team must clarify the parameters of capabilities, costs, and timelines to the business side and make sure that these perceptions </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">are accurate.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">It is important to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker699"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">note that CALMS operates as a framework rather than a collection of tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">In the realm of DevOps, organizations that adhere to the principles of CALMS are granted the flexibility to exercise discretion in selecting the tools integrated within their DevOps pipelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.3">The aforementioned tools include offerings from prominent vendors such as Atlassian and HashiCorp, alongside open source DevOps tools such as Git, Puppet, and Jenkins. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.4">Considering this, it is worth reiterating the emphasis that DevOps places on putting people </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">before tools.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">The CALMS framework, while valuable in its own right, should not be regarded as a substitute for alternative development philosophies and systems that can effectively enhance the level of control within the DevOps domain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.2">Agile methodologies, exemplified by approaches such as Scrum and Kanban, offer valuable frameworks for establishing a consistent and robust implementation of DevOps within an organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.3">Overall, the CALMS framework serves as a valuable tool for assessing the level of maturity and efficacy of a company’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">DevOps implementation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">Now that you understand the strategic importance of the CALMS approach and how you can leverage its flexibility to synergize your workflow, let’s discuss the DevOps mindset. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">Adopting a DevOps mindset necessitates that teams comprehend both the long-term and immediate advantages of DevOps and that they will likely require a change in their process, perspective, and patience for the time horizon that is needed to achieve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">these outcomes.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">It takes time to develop a DevOps mindset</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">The implementation of significant </span><a id="_idIndexMarker700"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">organizational transformations should ideally occur in a series of phases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">Otherwise, resistance or confusion may arise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.3">Rapidly challenging groupthink might result in a jarring experience known as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">culture shock.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">Embracing a DevOps culture necessitates obtaining agreement and support from individuals across all levels of the organizational hierarchy, including developers, systems administrators, security specialists, and executives alike. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">Teams must comprehend the enduring and immediate advantages of DevOps and they will likely require a demonstration of the changes in the processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.3">Ensure that these modifications are thoroughly documented and effectively communicated to all individuals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.4">Productivity will be negatively affected and there may be further harmful outcomes unless colleagues recognize that the fundamental principles of DevOps, including efficiency, adaptability, continuous learning, and unity, are in line with their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">own beliefs.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">Organizations that have already adopted the Agile methodology serve as optimal environments for the implementation of this cultural transition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">In the realm of DevOps, there exists a predilection among teams for responsive and proactive measures as opposed to sluggish and reactive ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.3">The DevOps culture places a strong emphasis on prioritizing objective improvements over subjective and self-centered approaches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.4">The cultivation of a team-first ethos is crucial for achieving enhanced productivity and overall advancements across all stages of a project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.5">Although the transition may not occur instantaneously, the outcomes are expected to be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">undeniably favorable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">One common misconception that arises is the belief that culture can be initiated or established from the outset. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">Contrary to the opinions of some, it is worth noting that developing culture from within holds significant importance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.3">However, it is widely held that culture can be considered a lagging indicator in various contexts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.4">The modification of operating practices leads to the alteration of culture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.5">A change in the team’s set of tools can potentially induce a transformation in culture </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">as well:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">Altering culture requires a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker701"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1"> significant amount of time as it necessitates transforming perspectives and strategies so that they work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.2">Although an individual can begin utilizing a new tool right away, it may take several years for an organization to perceive any level of maturity in its implementation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.3">Indeed, some firms have been implementing DevOps since 2016 or even earlier and regard themselves to still be in a state </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">of immaturity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">The development of culture is not a deliberate construction, but rather a natural and spontaneous process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">The phenomenon under consideration gradually becomes evident as the cumulative result of various human interactions and the subsequent transformations occurring within them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.3">These transformations are facilitated by the acquisition of novel operational capabilities that were previously unavailable, and the corresponding authorization to explore </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">these capabilities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">But that perspective isn’t shared by everyone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.2">It is easier to see how procedures, methods, and tool sets need to change when you begin with a cultural end goal in mind, according to several consultants and practitioners. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.3">However, due to changes in organizational priorities, competitive forces, consumer expectations, internal dynamics, and technology, pivots are likely to occur, even with a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">well-planned transition.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Regardless of the strategies that firms use to cultivate a collaborative culture between software engineers and operations people, it is crucial to recognize that any technique will initially offer slow results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">Cultural transformation is a gradual process that typically originates from the efforts of ordinary people at the local level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.3">An effective strategy to enhance these efforts is to identify outstanding ambassadors within the engineering community and support them in promoting the cause among </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">their colleagues.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">Achieving DevOps </span><a id="_idIndexMarker702"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">success necessitates a comprehensive understanding that there is no singular, straightforward approach to implementing organizational change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">Cultural shifts pose significant challenges due to the distinct market requirements, industry considerations, resource constraints, and varying levels of willingness to embrace change exhibited by different businesses and constituents. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.3">This book provides valuable recommendations for initiating the process of integrating development and operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.4">However, each organization must independently determine its unique cultural framework to implement the necessary transformative measures for success </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">in DevOps.</span></span></p>
