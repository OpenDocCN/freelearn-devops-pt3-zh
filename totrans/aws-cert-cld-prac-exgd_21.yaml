- en: '**Infrastructure as a Service** (**IaaS**) is a cloud service model that gives
    you access to virtualized infrastructure components comprising computing, network,
    and storage services. This is very similar to hosting your own VMware or Hyper-V
    virtualized platforms, where you deploy servers, attach storage volumes, and configure
    network connectivity services. However, the primary difference is that you do
    not have access to the underlying hypervisor platform with cloud-hosted IaaS solutions.
    IaaS offerings give the greatest amount of control over how the virtual components
    of your infrastructure are configured and also require you to take responsibility
    for managing, maintaining, and enforcing security measures for those components.'

    normally carry out a series of migration projects over time. During this migration
    phase, connectivity between the on-premises environment and the AWS cloud would
    be required to facilitate the migration. Many companies may also require a more
    permanent hybrid design architecture. This could be because certain types of applications
    need to be in much closer proximity to the on-premises infrastructure where users
    are based, such as your corporate office network, ultimately ensuring low-latency
    access, data residency requirements, or even unique local data processing requirements.
    AWS offers several services to build hybrid clouds from VPN technologies and Direct
    Connect services to offering on-premises services such as AWS Storage Gateway
    and AWS Outposts.

    without having to manually configure the underlying infrastructure that will support
    the application. You upload your code in a supported language and environment
    and AWS will provision the underlying infrastructure, such as the compute, storage,
    and network components, to support the application. Amazon ElasticBeanstalk will
    also enable you to specify how the underlying infrastructure components will be
    deployed – for example, you can specify the EC2 instance type and size that is
    deployed or enforce that a set minimum number of EC2 instances are deployed as
    part of an Auto Scaling group.
