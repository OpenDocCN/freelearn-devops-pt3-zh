<h1 id="_idParaDest-347"><a id="_idTextAnchor1127"/>Accelerate Cloud Adoption through DevOps </h1>
<p>Digital transformation initiatives focus on making use of modern and emerging technologies to offer a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The adoption of cloud-based technologies has become an integral part of it. Likewise, DevOps also plays a crucial role in accelerating your cloud adoption journey. </p>
<p>However, organizations must first embrace a culture of experimentation, shrug off their old working styles, and shift toward a lean yet iterative software development methodology. DevOps provides just the right mix of tools, practices, and cultural philosophies that will enable organizations to adopt cloud platforms and deliver high-quality applications at high velocity.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The role of DevOps in digital transformation</li>
<li>Modernization and cloud adoption </li>
<li>Managing software delivery modernization</li>
<li>Agile transformation and iterative planning</li>
<li>Integrating DevOps in your cloud adoption plan</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-348"><a id="_idTextAnchor1128"/>The role of DevOps in digital transformation</h1>
<p>For any business, digital transformation is all about making use of modern and emerging technologies to deliver <a id="_idIndexMarker1212"/>value to its customers and eventually <a id="_idIndexMarker1213"/>create opportunities for greater revenue generation. There is no other alternative to survive in the competitive landscape.</p>
<p>DevOps, with its all-encompassing philosophy to bring the best out of people, processes, and tools, increases the chances of an organization being successful. With a heightened focus on automation, the evolution of modern cloud platforms has eliminated many of the bottlenecks that existed previously. The time to market of high-quality products has drastically reduced, reducing the amount of funding required as well. DevOps is all about optimization and the ability to achieve more with the same set of resources and people. It aims to improve any existing business processes through the use of technology. Also, the merging of the goals of the development and operations teams provides the right amount of cooperation for improved collaboration among teams.</p>
<p>The role of <a id="_idIndexMarker1214"/>DevOps in digital transformation includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To drive change in the cultural mindset of people and encourage the adoption of automation</li>
<li>To promote collaboration between teams by breaking organization silos, thereby improving the overall productivity of the workforce</li>
<li>To reduce wastage and costs associated with any manual or inefficient processes</li>
<li>To expedite the <a id="_idIndexMarker1215"/>product innovation cycle, resulting in a faster time to market</li>
<li>To create opportunities to modernize existing IT assets with minimal disruption</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, we will review the benefits of DevOps in the modernization and cloud adoption journeys of organizations. </p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-349"><a id="_idTextAnchor1129"/>Modernization and cloud adoption </h1>
<p>Though cloud technologies have been around for a while now, the impact they can have on a business became obvious at the time of the Covid pandemic outbreak (in early 2020). Organizations that already had made investments in modernizing their businesses could survive the situation with minimal or no impact, whereas many traditional businesses had to incur huge losses. Here is an interesting article that explains the impact of the pandemic and how the future of work will pan out:<span class="subscript"> </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/from-surviving-to-thriving-reimagining-the-post-covid-19-return">https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/from-surviving-to-thriving-reimagining-the-post-covid-19-return</a>.</p>
<p>IT and business leaders understood that the adoption of cloud computing technologies was the way forward for the delivery of their services. IT was no longer seen just as an enabler; rather, it became an important tool for survival in the marketplace. Modern-day start-ups leverage technology to create a differentiating value proposition to attract customers. Enterprises have already begun to follow suit and one of the key strategic initiatives in every digital transformation journey is cloud adoption. </p>
<p>While cloud computing and DevOps are mutually independent concepts, the latter is important to achieve <a id="_idIndexMarker1216"/>business objectives through cloud technology adoption. Thus, DevOps has become a core priority for enterprises to ensure business continuity. Be it optimization of IT spending, streamlining development processes, collaboration across teams, offering greater reliability of service, and so on, DevOps encompasses all aspects of your IT strategy. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-350"><a id="_idTextAnchor1130"/>DevOps is the foundation of modernization</h2>
<p>There is a popular saying <a id="_idIndexMarker1217"/>that any structure is bound to break in the absence of a solid foundation. Likewise, establishing rigor around your DevOps practices is critical in your modernization journey.</p>
<p>The key benefits of <a id="_idIndexMarker1218"/>DevOps in modernization are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agility through automation </li>
<li>Improved productivity through better internal collaboration</li>
<li>Greater customer and employee satisfaction</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-351"><a id="_idTextAnchor1131"/>DevOps drives cloud adoption</h2>
<p>Cloud computing and associated technologies such as automation, <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>), devices, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1219"/>so on open the door to a wide range of possibilities for your business. Increased productivity and agility lead to profitability, automation reduces IT costs, and real-time monitoring and feedback loops improve the experience for your customers.</p>
<p>The key benefits <a id="_idIndexMarker1220"/>of DevOps in cloud adoption are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The automation of infrastructure modernization, on-demand provisioning, and scaling </li>
<li>The reduction of IT management overheads, offloading many tasks to the cloud service provider </li>
<li>Seamless integration with a variety of other platforms or products</li>
<li>Increased <a id="_idIndexMarker1221"/>deployment agility, improving time to market</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, we will review how DevOps can impact the roadmaps for any software modernization initiatives within an enterprise.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-352"><a id="_idTextAnchor1132"/>Managing software delivery modernization</h1>
<p>As organizations embark on their modernization journeys, they need to prepare a roadmap with <a id="_idIndexMarker1222"/>clear goals and objectives, so that they can measure their success and outcomes against it. Typically, DevOps practices impact the four major pillars of software delivery modernization, namely <strong class="bold">Software Life Cycle Management</strong>, <strong class="bold">Solution Architecture</strong>, <strong class="bold">Automation Practices</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Cloud Platform Adoption</strong>:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.1 – DevOps impact on software delivery modernization</p>
<p>Let us review the role of DevOps across the four pillars in the next sections.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-353"><a id="_idTextAnchor1133"/>Software life cycle management</h2>
<p>Organizations must <a id="_idIndexMarker1223"/>adopt an iterative development methodology to achieve greater agility in releases. Agile and Kanban are better suited to offer flexibility and adaptability over the traditional Waterfall-based software development life cycle methodology.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-354"><a id="_idTextAnchor1134"/>Solution architecture</h2>
<p>All modernization <a id="_idIndexMarker1224"/>journeys typically involve two sets of initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrating legacy applications to a cloud-based platform</li>
<li>Developing new software products leveraging innovative technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>Both require the convergence of the target solution architecture goals to a more microservice-based architecture over the traditional monolith-based approach. However, for legacy workloads, there will be challenges affecting their transformation. </p>
<p>Teams usually deploy three key strategies to modernize their IT assets in support of their cloud adoption journeys:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Rehosting</strong> – Identifying assets that fall under the category of lift and shift and that can be <a id="_idIndexMarker1225"/>moved to the new cloud platform infrastructure. Typically, these will be standalone-type applications with minimal dependencies. This offers businesses the instant ability to start operating from the cloud.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Refactoring</strong> – This <a id="_idIndexMarker1226"/>improves making small structural changes to your applications and repackaging them to take advantage of the cloud platform capabilities. </li>
<li><strong class="bold">Rebuilding</strong> – Certain <a id="_idIndexMarker1227"/>applications (typically 10-15% of your existing assets) must be re-engineered to take advantage of cloud platform capabilities. These <a id="_idIndexMarker1228"/>applications must be completely re-developed with a cloud-native architecture in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker1229"/>practices such as <em class="italic">Infrastructure as Code</em>, <em class="italic">Configuration Management</em>, <em class="italic">Test Automation</em>, and <em class="italic">Application Performance Monitoring</em> can play a significant role in improving the overall efficiency of your migration process.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-355"><a id="_idTextAnchor1135"/>Automation practices</h2>
<p>Automation is the key to <a id="_idIndexMarker1230"/>faster delivery to the market. In DevOps, you merge <a id="_idIndexMarker1231"/>both development and operations processes into a unified automated pipeline, such that all software components are continuously built, integrated, tested, and deployed. You discard any manual processes with the goal of achieving 100% automation in all aspects of software development. This ensures overall quality and improves the reliability of the software being released.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-356"><a id="_idTextAnchor1136"/>Cloud platform adoption</h2>
<p>Implement all software products and solutions using a cloud-native design approach. This <a id="_idIndexMarker1232"/>provides greater efficiency, thereby enabling organizations to stay focused on their core business priorities instead of managing infrastructure. The solutions built on top of a <strong class="bold">platform as a service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>) model offer better scalability and manageability, and can quickly adapt to changing <a id="_idIndexMarker1233"/>customer needs. The out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities provided by platform vendors make it relatively easy to detect faults and take corrective actions. </p>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss how iterative planning has to be adopted to deliver value during a cloud transformation journey. </p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-357"><a id="_idTextAnchor1137"/>Agile transformation and iterative planning</h1>
<p>Agile transformation <a id="_idIndexMarker1234"/>refers to the adoption of Agile-based project planning strategies within an organization to accomplish its vision. All teams function in accordance with the core values and principles of the Agile methodology. As an outcome, you can observe notable changes in the overall culture and behaviors of the teams.</p>
<p>Agile project management is all about incrementally delivering business value while having the flexibility <a id="_idIndexMarker1235"/>to respond to change. Quite like other practices, even planning must be continuous. Align the portfolio of projects (or the product backlog) with the business objectives and initiatives, and the teams allocated to execute them, while continuously adjusting according to the needs of the customer or even changes in business priorities. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-358"><a id="_idTextAnchor1138"/>Roadmap for transformation</h2>
<p>Creating an Agile transformation roadmap is never easy as each team and its requirements are <a id="_idIndexMarker1236"/>unique. However, by adhering to the principles of Agile, you can derive an Agile transformation roadmap that can serve as some sort of blueprint for teams.</p>
<p>A sample representation of a very high-level Agile transformation roadmap will look something like this:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer187">
<img alt="Figure 15.2 – Transformation roadmap " height="514" src="image/B18655_15_02.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.2 – Transformation roadmap</p>
<p>A more detailed Agile transformation roadmap should capture the key milestones, which can serve as a basis for creating more detailed plans. The detailed plans will capture more information about the roadmap items and action plans to achieve them. These plans help shift the mindset of the teams toward achieving an Agile transformation.</p>

<p>In the next section, we will review how to prepare your cloud adoption plan using a case study. </p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-359"><a id="_idTextAnchor1139"/>Integrating DevOps in your cloud adoption plan</h1>
<p>DevOps and <a id="_idIndexMarker1238"/>cloud adoption have fundamentally <a id="_idIndexMarker1239"/>transformed the way teams build and deploy applications. In fact, in the past few years, organizations have realized the true power of cloud platforms through the adoption of DevOps practices.</p>
<p>Microsoft provides Cloud Adoption Framework, which lays down certain principles, and guidance that organizations can adopt to establish a cloud adoption plan. You can read more <a id="_idIndexMarker1240"/>about Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview. </p>
<p>Microsoft also provides great guidance on architecting applications for the cloud using the <a id="_idIndexMarker1241"/>Microsoft Well-Architected Framework. You can read more about it here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/</a>.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will consider a case study and understand some of the key DevOps strategies that could be applied by an organization in its cloud adoption journey.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-360"><a id="_idTextAnchor1140"/>Case study</h2>
<p>As part of <a id="_idIndexMarker1242"/>this case study, we will consider a situation where a company named Packt Insurance Inc. would like to modernize its applications and deploy them on the Azure cloud. </p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
<p class="callout">This case study is designed to simulate a real-world scenario. However, it is not meant to be comprehensive and exhaustive to cater to all business requirements or scenarios. </p>
<h3>About Packt Insurance Inc.</h3>
<p>Packt Insurance Inc., a <a id="_idIndexMarker1243"/>company with a presence in over 10 countries (across America and Europe), offers a wide range of insurance products and services to its customers. </p>
<p>Over the last few years, the year-on-year growth of Packt Insurance has not been on par with the market opportunities. It is gradually losing to its competition due to a lack of market adaptability, high cycle time on innovation, and poor workforce productivity and collaboration owing to the use of legacy <strong class="bold">line-of-business</strong> (<strong class="bold">LOB</strong>) applications for running the business. Its cloud presence is limited and most of its applications are deployed as on-premises solutions.</p>
<p>In a recently concluded board meeting, the team took the decision to accelerate the digital transformation journey through its cloud adoption program. Packt Insurance wants to modernize even its LOB applications with a core priority of a cloud-first and mobile-first approach.</p>
<p>A summary of the key business drivers and stakeholder viewpoints is mentioned in the following sections. For this case study, it is meant to demonstrate how each stakeholder perceives the business problem and their requirements for the target solution.</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.3 – Phases in the modernization roadmap</p>
<p>In the preceding figure, you can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Phase 1</strong> – In this phase, the prioritized list of capabilities targeted for a <strong class="bold">minimum viable product</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>) will be released. The objective of this phase is <a id="_idIndexMarker1248"/>to quickly operationalize the first version of the platform.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Phase 2</strong> – This is a continuation of <em class="italic">Phase 1</em>, and the team will start the next set <a id="_idIndexMarker1249"/>of prioritized capabilities. Typically, in this phase, the first version of mobile apps and web portals will be released.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Phase 3</strong> – This will be the continuous innovation phase where the use of AI and machine learning capabilities will drive newer product offerings and improvement of the overall digital services deployed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-361"><a id="_idTextAnchor1141"/>Usual challenges and DevOps to the rescue</h2>
<p>The team <a id="_idIndexMarker1250"/>at Packt Insurance Inc. adopted DevOps practices and habits to activate the potential of the cloud transformation journey. </p>
<p>A high-level summary of the various actions taken by the team is given here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud onboarding and governance – It established a <strong class="bold">cloud center of excellence</strong> (<strong class="bold">CCoE</strong>), merged operations and development teams, and established <a id="_idIndexMarker1251"/>governance procedures for the cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li>Organization change management – It organized training on Agile methodology and modern DevOps practices, with a greater focus on driving cultural change. </li>
<li>Managing the portfolio of projects – It defined the key business objectives, identified the list of products and services, and created Agile teams for execution. </li>
<li>Continuous planning – It created high-level release milestones and then prioritized the backlog as per those. The team planned to release an MVP within the first 6 months, followed by incremental major releases every 3-6 months as per the charter of the identified phases.</li>
<li>Automating the life cycle – It invested in automation practices to drive predictability around the development, testing, and deployment of the products. The engineering teams achieved good velocity without compromising on quality.</li>
<li>Legacy workload migrations – It initially deployed a hybrid cloud setup that retained some of the applications on-premises. However, at the proper time, these were retired and rebuilt for the cloud. </li>
<li>Measuring success – It identified key DevOps metrics and tracked them effectively to measure their success.</li>
<li>DevOps tools used – It used Azure DevOps, GitHub, and Azure Monitor as the primary <a id="_idIndexMarker1252"/>tools for the implementation of the various DevOps practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we can observe that DevOps impacts all areas of the software development life cycle processes and change management within an organization. </p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-362"><a id="_idTextAnchor1142"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we have reviewed how the adoption of a cloud platform reduces time to market and creates opportunities that fuel the transformation of a business. Be it managing your cloud infrastructure through automation, optimizing IT spending by leveraging monitoring capabilities, or planning and releasing great products, DevOps touches all aspects of your cloud-based digital transformation journey. </p>
<p>The cloud also enables teams to work from remote locations, in support of hybrid work situations. Cloud technologies make it easy for teams to collaborate using the required tools without losing any time or functionality. Research (the DORA report) shows that both DevOps and cloud adoption will significantly increase in the years to come until they become the norm across all organizations. In summary, we can conclude that, when done well, DevOps and cloud adoption strategies can significantly impact the bottom line of your organization.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we shall explore the usage of containers when building scalable applications.</p>
