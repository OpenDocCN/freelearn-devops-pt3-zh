			<p>This section is a discussion of the practice of release engineering, using common tools for creating service builds ready for deployment and leading tools for deploying distributed applications.</p>
			<p>Unless you have been living under a rock, you might have noticed that the vast majority of new system deployments have moved out of corporate data centers and into cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud. The process of moving existing in-house applications is well underway, from the finance industry to telecommunication providers. DevOps engineers need to be well versed in building managed distributed platforms that enable their companies to operate in cloud, multi-cloud, and hybrid-cloud environments.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will show you how to automate the process of creating system images using Packer on the AWS platform, use Go with Terraform to create your own custom Terraform provider, program the Kubernetes API to extend its capabilities for your needs, provision resources using Azure's cloud SDK, and design resilient DevOps software that can avoid the mistakes that large cloud providers have already made.</p>
