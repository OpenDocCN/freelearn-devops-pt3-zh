			<p>As the Salesforce Platform evolves into an increasingly complex landscape, architects face a growing demand for advanced solutions. The key to successful Salesforce projects lies in effective DevOps practice, and this book helps you achieve just that by offering strategic and practical insights into <span class="No-Break">Salesforce components.</span></p>
			<p>This book starts by cultivating a DevOps mindset, focusing on collaboration, coordination, and communication. It helps you learn how to efficiently demonstrate governance, visibility, and accountability. Building upon this architectural foundation, you’ll delve into tools and techniques to plan your strategy using the capabilities of SFDX. Once you’ve gotten to grips with Salesforce packaging, you’ll learn how to build a CI/CD stack with freely available software and configure it for automated change delivery. You’ll then address the operational concerns of a mature DevOps process as you explore topics such as ticket management, backups, change monitoring, and data seeding. These are essential for maintaining a clean and healthy Salesforce org. Finally, you’ll learn about the ecosystem of third-party solutions, which provide out-of-the-box capabilities to accelerate your Salesforce <span class="No-Break">DevOps journey.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you’ll have demystified Salesforce DevOps, empowering you to deliver Salesforce projects with the expertise of a <span class="No-Break">DevOps professional.</span></p>
