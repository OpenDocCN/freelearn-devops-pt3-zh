    However, most of your configuration has been manual, with very little automation.
    For example, in [*Chapter 9*](B17124_09_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor223),
    *High Availability and Elasticity on AWS*, you deployed an application in a multi-tier
    design. This consisted of application servers configured in an auto-scaling group,
    an application load balancer, a database to store application data, and an S3
    bucket to host your source code. All of this was deployed in a private network
    in the form of **Amazon VPC**.

    and build infrastructure components to host your applications. Some of these tools
    fall within the PaaS model, where you simply need to focus on the application
    build and deployment strategy, and AWS will provision the necessary infrastructure
    to support that application. Other services enable you to define a template for
    your infrastructure that you may need to provision repeatedly. Using **Infrastructure
    as Code** (**IaC**), you can draft a template that describes how your services
    and resources need to be configured. AWS will then build the infrastructure, along
    with all its components, which can then be used to host your application. Automating
    your infrastructure deployments offers several benefits, including being able
    to scale your infrastructure globally by sharing your *templates* across your
    organization to enforce corporate standards and security best practices. Furthermore,
    by avoiding manual configuration efforts, you reduce the human error element.

    environments with different resource identifiers.

    type and size that the application was hosted on, you could deploy multiple test
    environments with different EC2 instance types and sizes. The input parameters,

- en: In this section, we will provide a quick introduction to another configuration
    management and orchestration service known as **AWS OpsWorks**. AWS offers three
    different services that fall under the AWS OpsWorks offering. There are AWS OpsWorks
    stacks and AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate, which let you use Chef cookbooks for
    configuration management. The third service is OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise,
    which lets you configure a Puppet Enterprise master server in AWS.

    server* that is used to communicate with, configure, deploy, and manage your nodes
    – which could be EC2 instances or even on-premises servers. The service also takes
    care of handling tasks such as software and operating system configurations, package
    installations, database setups, and more.'

    that is used to manage all your nodes and acts as a central repository for your
    Chef cookbooks. Chef cookbooks contain recipes that are authored using the Ruby
    programming language and enable you to define a collection of resources and their
    attributes that need to be configured.'

    approach to deploying your application and are not familiar with Chef or Puppet,
    you can also use AWS OpsWorks stacks. Next, we will look at the AWS OpsWorks stacks
    service.

    several resources running behind the scenes, including the host EC2 instances
    that the application runs on, backend databases such as Amazon RDS to store the
    application data, load balancers to distribute traffic, and so on. This group
    of related resources is what we call a stack.

    application stack. For example, your EC2 instances could represent the application
    layer, which is used to host the application. Next, your application load balancer
    will represent the load balancing layer, distributing traffic across the EC2 instances.
    Each layer is comprised of a template that allows you to specify the components
    of the resources that are being provisioned. For example, for the application
    layer, this would include your EC2 instance's security group or IP addressing
    details. You can provision any supported operating system and even add on-premises
    servers to the stack.

    Services*, we learned that **AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service that
    allows you to run code without having to provision or manage servers in the cloud.
    With AWS Lambda, you simply upload your code and have it executed based on a specific
    trigger. AWS Lambda will provision all the underlying infrastructure needed to
    run your code, be it compute power, memory, or temporary storage.

    applications or even be called directly from any web or mobile application. You
    could use AWS Lambda in conjunction with other serverless offerings such as API
    Gateway, DynamoDB, and the Amazon S3 static website hosting service to build the
    ultimate serverless application for your business or clients.

    day-to-day administrative tasks. This can include any repetitive tasks that are
    triggered by a specific event or even on a specific schedule. For example, you
    can automate how firmware updates are installed on hardware devices, start and
    stop EC2 instances, schedule security group updates if you need to make changes,
    and much more.

    that your **user acceptance testing** (**UAT**) team needs to perform multiple
    functional and technical tests on for an upcoming application that you are developing.
    Your UAT team only works from Monday to Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. The UAT team
    only needs access to the fleet of test servers during this time. Rather than have
    a technician manually start up all the servers in the morning and shut them down
    again at the end of the business day, you could automate the process using AWS
    Lambda. You would not want to have your on-demand EC2 instances running when they
    are not needed because you are charged for every hour that those servers are running.
