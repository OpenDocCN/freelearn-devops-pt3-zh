    that Scrum teams follow is estimating the effort of stories using story points.
    The Scrum team commonly estimates story points using planning poker. In planning
    poker, the team convenes and collaboratively develops the concept of the *1-point*
    story, a reference to the smallest amount of effort for completing a story and
    the basis for relatively comparing other stories against this reference.

    with numbers detailing the story points. The product owner reads the story, and
    the team members individually select a card with the number of story points. The
    Scrum master, acting as facilitator, then counts down for all members to reveal
    their choice at the same time. Those that reveal a different value are invited
    to explain the reason for their choice. This conversation with the entire team
    helps build a model of how the team sees work meant for the entire team.

    as *beating the other competitors*. The problem with these types of visions is
    that they tend to be transitory; what happens once you’ve accomplished your vision?
    The best visions, ones that will keep learning organizations moving forward in
    different situations, will be intrinsic, or inwardly focused in nature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another type of vision that may not endure as a shared vision is a *negative
    vision*. A negative vision describes what the organization wants to avoid as opposed
    to what it wants to be. The differing mindset diverts the energy that the organization
    needs, robbing the organization of achieving a long-term vision. An avoidance
    strategy also implies the organization is powerless to change its destiny. These
    types of visions are only effective in the short term, failing to give the organization
    any long-term vision.

    This experimentation is done in learning cycles that follow the PDCA format. Let’s
    look at what happens in each **Lean** **Improvement Cycle**.

    Cycle or **PDCA** cycle.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we looked at how value streams can follow the Third Way by
    adopting continuous learning and experimentation. We saw how this starts by looking
    at the journey organizations take to become learning organizations. They hone
    their learning through the five disciplines of personal mastery, mental models,
    shared vision, team learning, and ultimately, systems thinking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An approach for learning organizations to move toward their shared vision is
    to follow the Improvement Kata. In the Improvement Kata, after the desired future
    state is determined, the current state is identified. The value stream then identifies
    a target and an experiment to run. The experiment is run in a PDCA cycle, and
    the learning is applied to see if the value stream is closer or farther from the
    desired future state.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Lean Improvement Cycle or a PDCA cycle is used in the Improvement Kata as
    the framework for experimentation. The value stream plans the experiment, runs
    through the experiment, and checks to see if the results validate the experiment’s
    hypothesis. Based on the results, the value stream will make adjustments.

- en: This completes *Part 2* of this book, where we saw how to align our work in
    value streams, how we measure the effectiveness of the value stream at delivering
    value, and how, based on the value stream’s metrics, we proceed down a path of
    continuous learning to improve the value stream. In *Part 3*, we will look at
    how a value stream in SAFe, embodied as an ART, performs the tasks of delivering
    value through the marriage of process and technology known as the Continuous Delivery
    Pipeline.
