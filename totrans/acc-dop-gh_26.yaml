- en: In GHEC, even if you set up SAML SSO for your enterprise or organization, every
    user still needs a user account on GitHub.com. The GitHub user account is basically
    the identity of the user, and the SAML authorization is the access granted to
    certain Enterprise resources. The user could contribute to open source and other
    organizations using their identity, and must authenticate using SSO to access
    Enterprise resources. But many organizations don't want that. They want complete
    control over the identity of their users. The solution for that is **Enterprise
    Managed Users** (**EMU**). With EMU, the identity of users gets completely managed
    in the IdP. A new user gets created if a user logs in for the first time using
    the identity from the IdP. This user cannot contribute to open source or be added
    as an outside collaborator to other repositories. Also, the contributions only
    count to the profile of that user.

    **LDAP**, or **CAS**. The configuration is straightforward and not so different
    from GHEC. Users do not need a [GitHub.com](http://GitHub.com) account; they can
    sign in directly to the server using the IdP, similar to EMU. But if GitHub Connect
    is configured, users can connect their GitHub account in **User Settings** | **GitHub
    Connect** and share the number of contributions with their public GitHub profile.
    This way, they can connect multiple corporate identities to their GitHub profile
    if they choose to do so.
