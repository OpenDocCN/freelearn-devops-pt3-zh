- en: Usually, after the initial setup call, your first stop is with the hiring manager.
    Obviously, this can vary from place to place, but I find it to be the most common
    starting point. In our field, you can expect a technical screening round, which
    can be conducted by an individual or by a panel. For lead or management jobs,
    this can be conducted by your peers or maybe even by the people that report to
    you. Depending on the company, this can lead to another individual call with someone
    from your future leadership, which could mean your future boss or even their boss!
    Things they look for here are culture fit, the ability to communicate, and general
    compatibility. We will go into detail later. In some places, they may have more
    rounds. I have seen design-focused interviews, coding challenges, situational
    questions, behavioral, and even out-of-the-box thinking. I will cover this in
    [*Chapter 9*](B18117_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205), *Interviews Step by Step*.

  zh: 通常，在初步电话沟通之后，你的第一个面试对象是招聘经理。当然，这个顺序可能因公司而异，但我认为这是最常见的起点。在我们的领域，你可以期待一个技术筛选环节，可能由个人进行，也可能由小组进行。对于领导或管理职位，可能由同事或甚至你的下属进行面试。根据公司不同，这可能会导致与你未来领导的一对一电话沟通，可能是你的未来老板，甚至是他们的老板！他们在这里关注的是文化适配性、沟通能力和一般的兼容性。我们稍后会详细讨论。在一些公司，面试环节可能更多。我见过以设计为重点的面试、编程挑战、情境问题、行为问题，甚至是创新思维。我会在[*第9章*](B18117_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205)《一步步面试》中详细讨论这些内容。
- en: I also want to mention the fact that some technical jobs have programming tests,
    which could be offline or live, with someone watching you code and asking you
    questions. Some companies may also ask you to undertake behavioral or cognitive
    tests. I will cover these things in the non-typical interview walk-through. Coding
    tests might be common for software engineers, but much less so for DevOps professionals.
    I think three rounds is probably the most common setup. If you are being interviewed
    at larger companies, such as Fortune 100 companies, the process may entail four
    or five rounds.

  zh: 我还想提到的是，一些技术职位会有编程测试，可能是离线的，也可能是实时的，面试官会在你编程时观察并提问。有些公司可能还会要求你参加行为测试或认知测试。我将在非常规面试的详细介绍中讲解这些内容。编程测试对于软件工程师来说可能很常见，但对于DevOps专业人员则较少。我认为三轮面试可能是最常见的设置。如果你在大型公司面试，比如《财富》100强公司，面试过程可能需要四轮或五轮。

    we consider the first-round interview to be with someone from your team. Typically,
    this is the hiring manager. This interview can last from 30 minutes to an hour,
    and it usually involves the hiring manager telling you about the company, the
    team, what they need, and then asking you for your experience. Make sure you have
    done your homework and you know something about the company.

    but that will not convince your future employer that you will not leave them for
    better remuneration elsewhere in the future. It is better to tie your desire for
    a new role to your career development and to the company you are applying for

    determine how you would fit into the team. For example, if you are a manager,
    they will ask you about your leadership style. They may also ask you situational
    questions, such as *you telling them about a time* when you dealt with a particular
    issue. They may also ask you how you see yourself in terms of strengths, weaknesses,
    and career prospects, such as where you see yourself in 5 years.

    with a stakeholder and how you went about resolving this. People want to know
    you can handle disagreement and friction, and are resilient enough to survive
    the modern workplace, so have a few stories to hand that showcase how you dealt

    handy and practice, and this will become second nature.

- en: Once they have told you about themselves and the team, and once you have gone
    over your background and answered whatever questions they might have, they will
    certainly ask you whether you have any questions. This is a great time to show

    be a coding test, where someone gives you a problem and watches you solve it,
    possibly providing you with prompts followed by a period where you are required
    to work on the solution. During this time, they may ask questions regarding your
    work. It could be a panel interview, where three peers or experts ask you technical
    questions to see how deep your understanding extends across multiple domains.
    This is the most important round because you will be hired primarily for what
    you know, not for what you have done, and this is your opportunity to show it.
    Do not be afraid to ask questions if you need to, or to say *I don't know* when
    you are not sure. This is better than rambling, where you can end up digging a
    hole for yourself. You can always say *this is not my area of expertise* and prompt
    the interviewer to ask you a different question. Nobody knows everything, and
    so it is extremely easy to be stumped by someone who is trying to stump you. What
    you want to show are thoughtful answers and that you think about solutions in
    an intelligent and creative way.

    For cloud-related jobs, you may be asked specific questions on cloud services
    akin to those asked in certification exams. It pays to ask the recruiter what
    type of interview you will be facing next and whether there is any preparation
    advice. When there is a coding challenge, typically they employ a platform that
    allows you to use multiple programming languages, so you can generally use the
    one you are most familiar with. I always use Python, on account of how simple
    it is to use, but if you are more comfortable with Java, go for it. The key is
    to be proficient with at least one programming language. For these types of interviews,
    it is best to get plenty of practice, as stated previously. The following URL,

    If you are an individual contributor, you can meet a fellow engineer, a more senior

    common situational questions, such as what would you do if, or have you ever done
    this or that. If you search online for interview questions, you can find some
    common questions and then compile answers for them in writing. Rehearsing these
    answers will make sure not only that your answer is strong and convincing, but
    that your delivery is crisp and enticing. You don't want to clear the technical

    your challenges or how you collaborate across the organization. As with everything
    else, practice makes perfect.

- en: If things go well after you finish the entire interview loop, you may get feedback
    in as little as 1 week. This could be longer if they have a lot of candidates
    to interview. If you did not perform well, the loop may end prematurely, and you
    may get an automated message thanking you but they are moving forward with other
    candidates. Do not be discouraged. I estimate it takes at least 50 applications
    to get an offer for a job you may really want, taking 5-10 interviews. Very few
    people apply for one role and get an interview and an offer. There is a lot of
    competition for high-paying technical jobs, so be patient and try to stack the
