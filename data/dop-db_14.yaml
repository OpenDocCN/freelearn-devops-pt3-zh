- en: Once deployed, the team conducted a series of stress tests, emulating scenarios
    from minor updates to catastrophic system failures. Each time, the service held
    its ground. Every change was handled by rolling out a new instance without affecting

    sharp focus. There was an increase in costs due to the frequent build and deployment
    processes. But these costs were counterbalanced by the gains. With immutable infrastructure,
    the team noticed a drastic reduction in the time spent debugging inconsistent
    environments, leading to higher productivity. The faster recovery times minimized

    themselves needed maintenance and updates, and any errors in the scripts could
    lead to significant issues, given the scale at which they operated. There was

- en: Replication followed, a concept that involved maintaining identical copies of
    their database to distribute the read load. For their SQL database, the team implemented
    master-slave replication, with the master handling writes and slaves catering

    the database into horizontal partitions or “shards,” each capable of operating
    independently. This was a particularly appealing approach for their NoSQL databases
    due to the inherent support for sharding and the ability to distribute the shards
    across multiple servers for better performance and fault tolerance.

- en: Despite the potential benefits, Alex was well aware of the complexities of implementing
    sharding. Deciding on the right shard key to ensure evenly distributed data and
    minimal cross-shard operations was critical, and missteps could lead to uneven
