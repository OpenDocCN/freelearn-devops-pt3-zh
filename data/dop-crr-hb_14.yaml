  zh: 个人 DevOps 之旅
- en: In 2005, the decision to attend college for mechanical engineering at the *University
    of Minnesota* was made. In college, I needed to take a C++ computer science class.
    This class was the extent of a software-related course that could be taken in
    college; however, the course got me inspired to continue exploring programming
    and what could be done with it. This fascination led to me purchasing a microcontroller
    board, similar to what is known as an Arduino. I ended up creating a hosted web
    page on a web server, which lead to a dorm room that could be monitored from a
    computer.

  zh: 2005年，我决定去*明尼苏达大学*攻读机械工程专业。在大学时，我需要修一门C++计算机科学课程。这门课是大学里唯一的一门软件相关课程；然而，这门课让我激发了继续探索编程以及编程能做什么的兴趣。这种兴趣促使我购买了一个微控制器板，类似于现在大家所说的
    Arduino。我最终创建了一个托管在Web服务器上的网页，进而将宿舍房间与计算机连接，进行远程监控。
- en: I took a lab that focused on automation and robotics in my senior year in college,
    which inspired my interest in automation. The professor for my course also spurred
    my interest in automation. In the lab, we decided on a product we had to manufacture
    with no human interaction – we chose a wooden cribbage board. We were broken into
    groups of three and assigned a Fanuc six-axis robot, as well as a stage of the
    manufacturing process we were responsible for. My team was responsible for the
    packaging cell. After the cribbage board was created, it needed to be placed in
    a box, labeled, and shipped. I became very interested in the entire process and
    ended up spending far more time in the lab working on my cell, as well as helping
    other cells integrate with ours. The professor became the first academic mentor
    I had and was the reason I ended up taking the job I did out of college.

  zh: 我在大学最后一年选修了一门专注于自动化和机器人技术的实验课，这激发了我对自动化的兴趣。我的课程教授也激发了我对自动化的兴趣。在实验课上，我们需要制造一个没有人工干预的产品——我们选择了一个木制的玩具板。我们被分成三人小组，每个小组负责使用一台Fanuc六轴机器人以及一个制造环节。我所在的小组负责包装环节。当玩具板制造完成后，它需要被放入盒子中、贴上标签并发货。我对整个过程产生了浓厚的兴趣，最终我在实验室花费了更多时间在自己的环节上，并且帮助其他环节与我们的小组进行对接。教授成为了我第一个学术导师，也是我最终决定毕业后选择那份工作的原因。
- en: My first job out of college was working as a manufacturing engineer, a job I
    did not enjoy but took because of the exposure I was able to get with automation
    in an industrial setting. I sucked in as much as I could from my senior colleagues
    who worked in the automation department; one individual told me that it was impossible
    to master something quickly when you spend only a small portion of your time working
    on it. He recommended that I buy a used microcontroller to play around with on
    my own. I did and ended up setting up a home lab that grew into home automation
    tasks, and eventually into a fully automated home.

  zh: 我大学毕业后的第一份工作是做制造工程师，这份工作我并不喜欢，但我选择了它，因为我能在工业环境中接触到自动化技术。我从自动化部门的资深同事那里吸收了尽可能多的知识；其中有一位同事告诉我，如果你仅仅花很少的时间在某件事情上，是不可能迅速掌握它的。他建议我买一个二手微控制器，自己动手玩一玩。我照做了，最终搭建了一个家庭实验室，逐渐发展成家庭自动化任务，最终变成了一个完全自动化的家。
- en: My time as a manufacturing engineer ended and I started my career as an automation
    engineer working in the oil and gas industry in western North Dakota. During my
    tenure as an automation engineer, I was exposed to **supervisory control and data
    acquisition** (**SCADA**) systems. The engineers working on SCADA systems were
    developing software in Java and using Maven, Subversion, and Eclipse. I began
    researching software development in my free time and began learning new programming
    languages and tools in my spare time. Once I felt comfortable with programming,
    I began applying for jobs as a software engineer for the same company. Eventually,
    I landed my first software engineering role.

  zh: 我的制造工程师生涯结束后，我开始了作为自动化工程师的职业生涯，在北达科他州西部的石油和天然气行业工作。在担任自动化工程师期间，我接触到了**监控控制与数据采集**（**SCADA**）系统。参与SCADA系统的工程师们正在使用Java开发软件，并且使用Maven、Subversion和Eclipse工具。我开始在空闲时间研究软件开发，学习新的编程语言和工具。等到我对编程有了一定的信心后，我开始申请同一家公司内的软件工程师职位。最终，我拿到了我的第一个软件工程师职位。
- en: Software engineering was crazy fun – there was always something new to learn
    and a challenge to solve. I had a knack for picking up programming languages pretty
    quickly and wished to work with a more diverse code base. Another thing that I
    was struggling with was balancing work and life, or a lack thereof. I lived in
    Minnesota but needed to commute to western North Dakota frequently. I knew several
    individuals who worked at United Healthcare that continually encouraged me to
    apply. I applied to half a dozen software engineering roles I thought I was a
    good fit for.

  zh: 软件工程非常有趣——总是有新东西可以学习，总是有挑战需要解决。我很快就能掌握新的编程语言，并希望能接触到更为多样化的代码库。另一个让我感到困惑的问题是如何平衡工作和生活，或者说，是工作和生活的不平衡。我住在明尼苏达州，但需要经常通勤到北达科他州西部。我认识几位在联合健康保险公司工作的人，他们一直鼓励我申请工作。我申请了大约六个我认为自己比较适合的软件工程师职位。

    role. They have heard of software boot camps and are considering leaving their
    job to attend a 6-month boot camp. I strongly caution against doing this; first,
    you are not guaranteed a job after you graduate. You could go through the boot
    camp, only to come out and not be able to land a job. The second reason I do not
    feel it is a great idea to leave a job without a solid job offer in hand is that
    you will go into debt for tens of thousands of dollars. Instead, I recommend staying
    at your current job and taking advantage of the tuition reimbursement your company
    offers. Use these funds to take programming courses, get certifications, and even
    pursue an online degree. On top of this, something you can do even if your company
    does not offer tuition reimbursement is research and study on your own. Think
    of the amount of time you spend watching Netflix and playing video games; use
    a portion of this time to learn new things that will help you land your next job.
    I respect candidates who are self-taught and speak with many other leaders who
    have similar opinions.

  zh: 在上述例子中，这位个体的工作是软件分析师，但他们希望转向一个薪水更高的软件工程职位。他们听说了软件训练营，并考虑辞掉工作去参加为期六个月的训练营。我强烈不建议这样做；首先，你毕业后并不保证能找到工作。你可能经历过训练营，但出来后却找不到工作。第二个原因是，如果没有可靠的工作机会，你离职后将背负数万美元的债务。我建议你留在当前工作岗位，利用公司提供的学费报销机会。用这些资金来参加编程课程、获得认证，甚至追求在线学位。此外，即使你的公司不提供学费报销，你也可以通过自学和研究来提升自己。想想你花在看Netflix和玩视频游戏上的时间；将这些时间的一部分用来学习新知识，这些知识将帮助你找到下一个工作。我尊重那些自学成才的候选人，也与许多持有相似观点的领导者交谈过。

    something that was not my best work, so long as I would get good marks. I was
    extremely interested in the robotics lab and decided I wanted to get the most
    out of it so that I could use it in my career down the road. I prioritized the
